 CurvGN outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks, especially on large and dense graphs, which tend to have a large variation of local structures.
Some of the previous researches change the network structure for better quantization performance, e.g, Mishra et al., (2018) double or even triple the convolutional filters to reduce accuracy degradation.
1. Our method provides a new perspective for explaining the effectiveness of knowledge distillation. i.g,we explore the essential reason why the born-again network (Furlanello et al., 2018) exhibits superior performance.
 Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 5.
 Define Eij as a matrix in which the (i, j)-th component is 1 while all other components are 0.
Our work is related to Syed et al., (2008); Cai et al., (2019).
 Moreover, CL can adaptively select samples for stagewise training, which bridges a connection between curriculum learning and robust learning.
 Our results are in line with those obtained for single symmetry groups and support our stated hypothesis.
 These are for the shallow network and the generalization error is essentially given by the norm based bounds.
 We empirically verify our results through numerical experiments.
 First, instead of learning pair-wise relationships among capsules, we learn to projectively encode a description of each capsule-type for every layer.
 To solve the optimization problem in a large space and promote generalization, we attach auxiliary sparsity regularization to the distribution of edges, resulting in critical connections and better generalization.
 In our experiments, when the latent code is partitioned in the baseline LatentODE (Rubanova et al., 2019), the model achieves better performance in curve extrapolation.
 Compared with global pooling, our method can effectively utilize inputs information to capture key part more precisely.
 We use an ensemble of neural networks to output a mean and variance for each candidate architecture and then use the UCB acquisition function to guide the search.
 One is a crowd-sourced image classification dataset, another is a collection of movie ratings, and the other three are match records from online games.
We present the necessary background material and problem formulations in Section 2.
 We find attention-based updates to be essential because the most significant portion of an input sequence may occur anywhere throughout the document.
 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proves the convergence of DMSGD with sparse communication and memory gradient.
 (Trinh et al., 2019) attempt to modify CPC for image representation learning by using the patch-based data extraction and modeling dependencies in a BERT-like fashion using self-attention.
 The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) (van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008) is an unsupervised manifold learning method primarily used for data exploration and visualization by approximating highdimensional data distribution using a two or three-dimensional map that could preserve local and certain global structures of the data.
Our contributions are as follows:
 Further, our distributed implementation shows that the resulting algorithm considerably reduces communication cost of distributed training, without adversely impacting accuracy.
 For the energy-efficient integer neural network chips, it needs to remap the changed network architecture to hardware and adds to computational and memory access overhead due to the increased filters and parameters.
 2.Our method gives insightful analysis of network compression.
 Also, denote ei as a vector such that the i-th component is 1 while all others are 0.
 Syed et al., (2008) study the generalization and computational properties of apprenticeship learning.
 Both are missing in previous works.
Contributions.
 It is not obvious that these bounds also give sharp bounds for deep models.
Our theoretical analysis requires the decay of learning rate (which is known to hinder the convergence rate.) Unfortunately, we show in Theorem 4 that the decay of learning rate is necessary for FedAvg with E > 1, even if full gradient descent is used.
 This we do by associating each capsule-type with a vector-valued function, given by a trainable neural network.
 Our contributions are as follows:
 Compared with using the attention mechanism at the beginning of the model, this method can significantly reduce parameters and computation, because the feature maps of high layers are much smaller than that after embedding.
 We perform an extensive study of our algorithm and show it performs on par or superior to several state-of-the-art NAS algorithms on two different search spaces.
 We consider, in addition to the cross entropy loss, the prediction accuracy as another metric (defined in (9)).
 In Section 3, we provide a general form of the PROJECT AND FORGET algorithm and detail its theoretical analysis.
 While the datasets we study often start with highly discriminative features (titles and abstracts), we conduct experiments to show our attention mechanism can find the important parts of text even when it does not occur in the first segment.
Our key contributions are as follows:
 The use of t-SNE for anomaly detection has been sceptical (van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008).
 Our empirical results show that NUQSGD can provide faster end-to-end parallel training relative to data-parallel SGD, QSGD, and Error-Feedback SignSGD (Karimireddy et al., 2019) on the ImageNet dataset.
 It encourages us to continue the endeavor in applying theoretical insights in successful deployments of deep learning.
 As a result, keeping the network structure intact is important.
The rest of the paper is organized such that related work is in Section 2, details of our weakly supervised clustering framework are in Section 3, results of the experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets are in Section 4, results of the experiments in semantic segmentation of breast cancer metastases are in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes the paper.
 3.Our method can be used to diagnose and refine knowledge representations of pre-trained DNNs and boost the performance without any additional annotations for supervision.
 Additionally, we define 1k ∈ Rk×1 is a vector whose components are all 1, while those of 0n×m ∈ Rn×m (or briefly, 0) are all 0.
 Since they assume that the state space of the underlying Markov decision process is finite, they do not consider any reward/policy function approximations; Cai et al., (2019) study the computational properties of imitation learning under a simple control setting.
 Moreover, our CL supports mini-batch update, which is convenient to be used as a plug-in in many deep models.
PAC-Bayes bound is also applied to obtain a non-vacuous compression based bound (Zhou et al., 2019).
4 If the learning rate is fixed to η throughout, FedAvg would converge to a solution at least Ω(η(E − 1)) away from the optimal.
 This network assumes the role of the prediction mechanism in capsule networks.
We stress that the focus of our work is not necessarily to derive new algorithms nor to establish which of the various special cases of AISLE is preferable.
 As a result, we show that our framework consistently yields almost the best performances across all of these datasets in terms of both metrics.
 We instantiate our algorithm to solve three types of metric constrained problems in Section 4 andhighlight the empirical performance.
 In either case, updating a LM’s parameters from only the first input segment performs well– often better than just using a baseline of the original LM with the input truncated to fit the max size.
 However, no comprehensive investigation has been made in this topic.
 We design feasibility rules based on the selected station sequence to ensure the reasonable connection patterns of metro line, which is more efficient to formulate the problem than integer programming models.
Summary of Contributions.
Concerning all the factors above, in this paper, we present a learned linear symmetric quantization (LLSQ) method and also evaluate it on a low-precision neural network accelerator through hardware-software co-design.
Contributions of this study can be summarized as follows.
 For the brevity, i : j denotes {i, · · · , j}.
 Their assumption on linear policy and quadratic reward is very restrictive, and does not hold for many real applications.
 However, the bound is still for the compressed (quantized) models and it is not obvious that that bound can be converted to that for the original network.
 To establish Theorem 4, we construct a specific `2-norm regularized linear regression model which satisfies our strong convexity and smoothness assumptions.
Since most verification methods available work on ReLU-based deep neural networks, we focus on neural networks with ReLU activation units in this paper.
 We interpret the role of this network as a means of encoding the manifold of legal pose-variations for its associated capsule-type.
 Indeed, while we compare all algorithms discussed in this work empirically on Gaussian models in the supplementary materials, we refer the reader to Tucker et al., (2019); Le et al., (2019) for an extensive empirical comparisons of all the algorithms discussed in this work.
 Complete proofs and discussion may be found in the sections in the Appendix.
 However, we find using an attention mechanism consistently improves performance and achieves the best results in our experimented language models.
 Our architecture learning to decode missing patches in an image by extracting represenstations of the given patches, using attention-pooling to aggregate the context, and decode the low-bit grayscale sub-sampled versions of the missing patches.
 Taking advantages of both disentangled representation learning (using β-VAE as an implementation) and low-dimensional manifold learning (using t-SNE as an implementation), we propose a novel anomaly detection approach named AnoDM, standing for Anomaly detection based on unsupervised Disentangled representation learning and Manifold learning.
 Specifically, our mainly contributions are:
 Notation.
Relation between compression and learnability was traditionally studied in a different framework as in Littlestone & Warmuth (1986) and minimum description code length (Hinton & Van Camp, 1993).
 However, we point out that our framework is applicable to any neural network architecture.
 It is expected that, given proper training, shallower capsules that have no relationship with a particular capsule-type will project themselves to a vector of low activation (for example, 2-norm), when input to the corresponding network.
 The optimization space is defined as a complete graph, through assigning learnable weights which reflect the importance of connections, the optimization of topology is transformed into learning a set of continuous variables of edges.
 Notation.
 Therefore, our contributions are as follows:
Notations: Our paper includes some notations that need to be defined here.
 Specifically, we decode only the 2-bit grayscale version of the missing patch.
 We introduce a new anomaly score function by combining: (1) β-VAE’s reconstruction error, and (2) distances between latent representations of test points and training points in t-SNE map.
 Without expert knowledge, our general method can be easily extended to the metro expansion considering multi-factors.
 Given a vector x = (x1, ..., xd)> ∈ Rd, we define ‖x‖22 = ∑d j=1 x 2 j .
 Moreover, NPCL is also very simple and efficient, which can be used as a plug-in in deep models as well.
 As an aside, it is this mechanism that gives the name to our model.
 We repeatedly employ the shorthand p(f) := ∫Z f(z)p(z) dz for the integral of some p-integrable test function f ; thus, p(f) = Ez∼pf(z) if p is a probability measure.
 This result suggests that it can potentially be adaptable for other tasks as well.
 Let g denote the index set {1, 2, · · · , g}.
 AnoDM is a general framework, thus any disentangled representation learning and manifold learning techniques can be applied.
 We also quantize bias and scaling factors, in support of the low bitwidth integer arithmetic units and accumulators on the accelerator.
 Given a function f : Rd 7→ R, we denote its `∞ norm as ‖f‖∞ = maxx |f(x)|.
 We term this manifold the ’space-of-variation’ of a capsule-type.
 Since, we attempt to learn such spaces at each layer, we name our model ’space-of-variation’ networks (SOVNET).
 In this design, the number of trainable networks for a given layer depend on the number of capsule-types of that layer.
As mentioned earlier, the choice of prediction networks and routing algorithm is important to having guarantees on learning transformation-invariant compositional relationships.
 Thus, in order to ensure equivariance, which we show is sufficient for the above, we use group-equivariant convolutions (GCNN) (Cohen & Welling, 2016) in the prediction phase.
 Thus, shallower capsules of a fixed type are input to a GCNN associated with a deeper capsule-type to obtain predictions for it.
 Apart from ensuring equivariance to transformations, GCNNs also allow for greater parameter-sharing (across a set of transformations), resulting in greater awareness of local object-structures.
 We argue that this could potentially improve the quality of predictions when compared to isolated predictions made by convolutional capsule layers, such as those of (Hinton et al., 2018).
The last contribution of this paper is an equivariant degree-centrality based routing algorithm.
 The main idea of this method is to treat each prediction for a capsule as a vertex of a graph, whose weighted edges are given by a similarity measure on the predictions themselves.
 Our method uses the softmaxed values of the degree scores of the affinity matrix of this graph as a set of weights for aggregating predictions.
 The key idea being that predictions that agree with a majority of other predictions for the same capsule get a larger weight - following the principle of routing-by-agreement.
 While this method is only heuristic in the sense of optimality, it is provably equivariant and preserves the capsule-decomposition of an input.
 We summarise the contributions of this paper in the following:
 Furthermore, q⊗K(z1:K) := ∏K k=1 q(zk).
 To keep the notation concise, we hereafter suppress dependence on the observation x, i.g,we write qφ(z) := qφ,x(z) as well asπθ(z) := pθ(z|x) = pθ(z, x) pθ(x) = γθ(z) Zθ ,where γθ(z) := pθ(z, x) and where Zθ := pθ(x) = ∫ Z γθ(z) dz.
 We define query x as a key if x ∈ S, or a non-key if x /∈ S.
 Let n denote the size of keys (n = |S|), and m denote the size of non-keys.
 We denote K as the number of hash functions used in the Bloom filter.
 The choice of a lower-level encoding scheme in β-VAE depends on data type of interest.
 For image data, deterministic convolutional network (CNN) is used in the encoder.
 In case of time series (sequence) data, we design an improved version of β-VAE by replacing CNN with temporal convolutional network (TCN) (Bai et al., 2018), a generic architecture for convolutional sequence prediction, in the encoder.
 We incorporate TCN as part of the encoder, because Bai et al., (2018) have shown that TCN outperforms canonical recurrent networks such as LSTMs (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) across a range of supervised learning tasks and recommended that CNN should be regarded as the first method to try for sequence modeling tasks.
 Regarding the decoding architecture, we simply choose CNN, because by choosing a simpler CNN architecture as a part of the decoder, the model can achieve a comparable even better performance but take much less running time.
The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.
 Compared with the realistically planned lines, the results show the rationality of considering social equity in transportation planning.
 The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
 We then deploy our quantization model on the accelerator to illustrate the efficacy of the workflow.
 The latter is solved by a temporal discretization and the gradient of the unknown solution at each time step is approximated by a neural network.
 In addition, we limit the perturbed audio waveform proportional to the original audio waveform at all timestamps.
Our insight is that this initial phase of training using a high learning rate, even with no improvement in loss, is crucial for generalization and is one of the key missing pieces from prior attempts at automatic learning rate tuning.
 A user may have many neighbors, but GNNs must respond in limited time, which prohibits exact computation.
 Hill et al., (2017) proposed Hill-climbing multivariate optimization Casella & Berger (2002) for TS-GLM, and recognized it obtained faster convergence speed with polynomial exhaustive parameter space.
 The majority of the parameters in thenetwork remain shared across domains, and learned from abundant training data to effectively avoid overfitting.
This work introduces a novel model-agnostic loss function that relaxes the reliance of the learning process on the exact temporal location of the annotations.
NODEs are typically trained with adjoint method.
Unlike previous works, our aggregation scheme (Eq. (6)), which itself is of independent interest in some other contexts, is a direct optimization of our generalization upper bound (Eq. (3)) without resorting to heuristics.
To the best of our knowledge, it was an open question whether any convergence rate analysis can be established for black-box min-max optimization.
 As a result, a majority of model parameters that represent these layers, may occupy hundreds of gigabytes of space.
 In particular, we focus on the representation power of the multi-head self attention layer.
 Then, we employ a (parallel) mixing step where we generate a new sequence whose token at every time step is either from the model prediction or the ground-truth.
 Experimental results show that the reflection-based method enables such transfers, achieves comparable performance to analogy-based methods with explicit attribute knowledge, even though our proposed method does not use such knowledge.
More specifically, we make the following main contributions:
 While 1-D and 2-D representations have been very successful for many drug compounds, these representations are not sufficient to describe all molecules.
 Specifically, we design several loss functions to fit different representations from BERT layers: 1) the output of the embedding layer; 2) the hidden states and attention matrices derived from the Transformer layer; 3) the logits output by the prediction layer.
 Furthermore,using a neural network model scales far better than a GP model, as it avoids the computationallyintensive matrix inversion operation.
 Moreover, the results are validated on the large-scale dataset, i.g,, ImageNet.
 By and large, GANs are better than VAEs in the quality of the generated data while VAEs learn better disentangled representations, in particular in the unsupervised setting.
Whereas the original VAE uses a standard Gaussian prior, it can be extended by introducing a learnable parameterized prior distribution.
 First, to avoid mode collapse in the sequences, we initially sample reference subsequences from a held-out reference set to encourage multi-modal behaviors in the generated sequence, which is mainly inspired from non-parametric methods (Haarbach et al., 2018).
 The stereo matching task has two requirements for the feature extraction network.
 Given a set of graphs, our model approximates their distribution in an unsupervised manner.
 This Dirichlet layer yields a distribution on top of the multinomial output parameters.
 Also worthy of note, in spite of high variance, we can extract statistical information from the variance, the statistics can be innovatively leveraged to prune search space and improve the search result.
 Hence, the proposed network can be characterized by Manifold Modeling in Embedded Space (MMES).
 To achieve this goal, the original network parameters are lifted to a coupled pair, with one weight set W of parameters following the standard gradient descend to explore the over-parameterized model space, while the other set of parameters learning structure sparsity in an inverse scale space, i.g,, structural sparsity set Γ.
 Particularly, based on differential inclusions of inverse scale spaces (Huang et al., 2018), SplitLBI has the merit of learning both an over-parameterized model weight set (Over-Par set) as the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and structural sparsity model weight set (Stru-Spa set) in a coupled inverse scale space.
 This aim of this study is to design and develop dependency parser for Amharic language that uses the rule of arc-eager transition system.
 Therefore, Apprenticeship Learning algorithms (Abbeel & Ng, 2004; Syed & Schapire, 2008) that try to mimic the expert cannot be used and, instead, we focus on directly learning the mapping.
Updating the parameters with data from a new dataset exposes the model to drastically deteriorate its performance on previous data, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989).
 The image quality is even worse.
 The coupling flowrequires a disjoint partitioning of the latent representation of the data (graph) in each layer.
The discussion so far urges us to develop a hardware-agnostic and theoretically reasonable metric for measuring computational costs of neural network architectures.
 The theorem states that when considering the moments of the gradient at a certain layer, one can change the architecture, so all connections which that skip that layer are removed.
 Adversarial defense: By optimizing for both peractivation uncertainty and the network’s predictive accuracy, a representation-level data augmentation policy is trained that perturbs the internal features during training for increased robustness (Alemi et al., 2017; You et al., 2018).
 In real world applications, recognizing the implicatures of a statement is arguably more important than recognizing its mere semantic content.
This work aims to address the above problem by incorporating joint error to formalize an optimizable upper bound such that the undesired overlap due to a wrong match can be properly penalized.
 Hence, designing a novel framework hinges heavily upon accurate inference of these underlying models.
 The guarantees apply to arbitrary `0, `2, and `∞-norm attacks; they do not require prior knowledge of the adversary’s attack strategy.
 We assess the scope of the model on synthetic data and we present superior clustering performance on MNIST.
However, aforementioned online distillation methods make use of only the logit information.
 This metric can be more naturally connected with the adversarial behavior of DNNs than the traditional metric of accuracy.
 These methods have achieved good performance when the data in both domains are sampled from the same data distributions but under different label distributions.
 This setting will relax the requirements of high reporting complexity, and has wide applications in collecting training samples for machine learning tasks.
 Firstly, gradient perturbation does not require strong assumption on the objective because it only needs to bound the sensitivity of gradient update rather than the whole learning process.
 The same study revealed that for classification, Platt Scaling (Platt, 1999), a simple scaling of the pre-activation of the last layer, achieves well calibrated confidence estimates (Guo et al., 2017).
 Finally, we introduce and benchmark on SABER a new state-of-the-art agent: a distributable combination of Rainbow and Implicit Quantiles Network (IQN) (Dabney et al., 2018).
 Already, GANITE presents a significant modification to the original GAN framework - rather than the discriminator discriminating between entirely real or entirely fake samples, the discriminator is attempting to pick out the real component from a vector containing the real (factual) outcome from the dataset and the fake (counterfactual) outcomes generated by the generator.
 More specifically, MLModelScope guarantees repeatable and fair evaluation by (1) defining a novel scheme to specify model evaluation whichseparates the entanglement of data/code/SW/HW; (2) defining common techniques to provision workflows with specified HW/SW stacks; and (3) providing a consistent benchmarking and reporting methodology.
 Both the clean and the noisy images are then used to learn a classifier,where the noisy examples are weighted by relevance.
 This may indicate that the compression phase is linked to the overfitting phenomena.
FURL has advantages over conventional on-server training since it exploits the fact that models are already distributed across users.
This paper is structured as follows.
 A common drawback of these methods are their implementation complexity or their need for multiple GPUs for acceleration.
As shown in fig.  1 (b), the HR image generated by the state-of-the-art method ESRGAN Wang et al., (2018b) cannot handle real mobile images well.
2 Here we inspect the proposed Jacobian-based approach and show that only the concatenated input affects the technique’s performance in detecting adversarial examples, with the Jacobian having no effect.
 Finally, we fuse and process multi-frame vehicle’s location and orientation information to complete visual-only vehicle trajectory description.
 However, there is no indication that this choice is universally well-behaved.
 For example, Beluch et al., (2018) and Sinha et al., (2019) only acquire 40k and 64k samples at a time respectively on ImageNet, never use more than 30% of the dataset, and do not compare to the full dataset performance.
 In addition, the proposed learning approach can easily be incorporated into other representation learning frameworks, and boosts their performance accordingly.
In summary, the main contributions of our paper are the following:
 Another notable improvement was given by the consistency term WGAN (CT-WGAN) (Wei et al., 2018), which penalizes diverging from 1-Lipschitzness directly.
 Otherwise, the agent will take advantage of both expert information and the reshaped Q-value function to update the policy.
1Code will be available soon.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
 Due to its distributed nature, MANAS enables large-scale optimisation of deeper networks while learning different operations per cell.
Our main contrutions are :
 Specifically, we propose a new algorithm, NeuralUCB, which uses a deep neural network to learn the underlying reward function.
To achieve an early estimation of the performance of a DL model, the key challenge is to select a small yet effective subset of testing data for testing the model.
 This avoids the VAE problem of disjoint or overlapping regions in latent space.
 It is a more difficult task compared to operating on 2D data because of the higher data dimension and fewer data features.
Unsupervised abstractive models.
 An extended review of recent continual learning methods is provided by Parisi et al., (2019).
 (2) an estimation of the margin between true log-likelihood and the ELBO that exports a tighter evidence lower bound by applying optimal transport (Ambrosio & Gigli, 2013) scheme to the distribution of latent variables.
 Despite intense research efforts, such gap in performance renders the problem of continual learning an open research question.
 Take model over-fitting prevention for example, one way to address this is to augment the objective function with regularization terms, such as L1 or L2 regularization.
 One fix could be to subsample the constraints and only compute those gradients, but this approach runs into the same drawbacks as before.
 Thus we refer to our framework as “Differentiable Data Selection” (DDS).
 Due to the promoted prototypical magnetization property, this global view enables more efficient learning of discriminative embeddings from few examples, which is the key challenge in few-shot learning.
 Ablation experiments highlight the role that WordPiece tokenization (Schuster & Nakajima, 2012) plays in robustness to human instructions.
 Similarly, TriMap is initialized with the low dimensional PCA embedding, and this embedding is then modified using a set of carefully selected triplets from the high-dimensional representation.
 This paper provides new insights into this relationship.
1For example, the best performing CIFAR-10 classifier from Zagoruyko & Komodakis (2016) has 32.5 million parameters, while the private baseline we describe in Section 4.1 has about 26 thousand.
 Our deep multi-agent reinforcement learning approach combines both worlds.
Assuming Markovian dynamics, the interactions between a thermostat and\nits environment can be modelled as a MDP.
Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020\nset. We refer to these as out-of-episode (OOE) examples.
 These methods even outperform more classical approaches, despite the relative lack of biological prior knowledge incorporated into those models.
 Our proposed framework is a generative model, so it cal be highly applicable across all GNNs and allows simultaneously estimating different types of associated uncertainties with the class probabilities.
Evaluation results of our approach on three existing semantic parsing datasets (see Table 1 for a sample input-output pair for each dataset) show that our model improves upon the state-of-the-art results and the generator-reranker architecture can substantially improve parsing performance.
 For a detailed discussion on related work, see section 4.
 We also compare the convergence performance between TopK-SGD and RandK-SGD on a 16-worker distributed setting with three popular convolutional neural networks (VGG-16 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014), ResNet-20 and ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016)).
 This helps reducing the model bias while effectively approximating true objective, which is the value function of the policy.
 We examine both the NG-MCTS and conditional production rule generating NNalone.
 To constrain the mapping function, we employ distribution regularization in theembedding space leveraging optimal transport theory.
 We summarize our contributions as the following:
 Several prior works have investigated the difficulties of training deep networks (Glorot & Bengio, 2010; Balduzzi et al., 2017), and the benefits of width (Nguyen & Hein, 2017; Lee et al., 2019; Du et al., 2018; Allen-Zhu et al., 2018).
 UDA outperforms all existing semi-supervised learning methods by significant margins.
 We summarize the contributions of this work as follows:
 This is the key intuition of our results in this paper.
We seek to optimize for the computational efficiency of multi-task architectures by finding models that perform as well as possible while reducing average node use per task.
 Unlike IL and GPS, our method transfers policies between task with significant differences in the transition models.
 On the other hand, with a deep neural network architecture, complexdata types like images can be integrated into tabular data efficiently.
 As we will show, this guidance not only makes the search more efficient but also improves the search result.
 The proposed approach simplifies the graph down sampling problem into a column/row sampling problem.
 Therefore DNN’s vulnerability to adversarial attacks is due to the lack of causal understanding.
 Building upon a promising and popular CFD technique, the RANS-LES coupling approach (E.
 Every training image isindependently annotated by 3-5 workers, resulting in a total of 527,489 annotations over 147,108 images.
 The first is HSimplE, which is inspired from SimplE (Kazemi & Poole, 2018), origi-Michelle ObamaUndergradPhDPrincetonKing’s College CambridgeAlan Turing(a) DEGREE FROM UNIVERSITY defined on three facts.
Drucker & LeCun (1991) implemented gradient regularization using ‘double backpropagation’, which has been shown to improve model generalization (Novak et al., 2018).
 Since the activation-based representation is constructedbased on the information that the network has already learned, the curved part of the digit ‘6’ will be characterized effectively by the activation.
 To this end, we propose a novel, general technique for extending graph representations with metadata embedding dimensions while debiasing the remaining (topology) dimensions.
 Deep neural networks allow for rapid question-synthesis using encoder-decoder modeling, eliminating the need for the expensive symbolic search and feature evaluations in Rothe et al., (2017).
 A pre-trained style classifier is also used for style regularization.
 We use them along with two standard multi-agent tasks to present a detailed evaluation of our approaches against three different baselines.
 In particular, we demonstrate up to a 55% increase in certified accuracy at = 0.2 on MNIST, up to a 20.5% increase at = 2/255 on CIFAR, and up to a 24% increase at = 8/255 on GTSRB.
Our key contributions are:
 During learning, given the first token “Amazing”, student models might ask “How about saying amazing view?”, teacher models most likely give high rewards since it’s expected to go with“Amazing view of the seaside, of the boats in the seaof the beach, from the boats· · · , · · · along the sea, of the birds flying over the water  ”, where most of them express similar meanings with the human references even though they have mismatched n-grams.
 We hope this will also help further our understanding of how neural networks respond differently to OOD examples in general, not just how a particular network responds to examples coming from a particular distribution.
 Finally, GT-GAN is scalable with at most quadratic computation and memory consumption in terms of the number of nodes in a graph, making it suitable for at least modest-scale graphs (with hundreds of nodes, compared to the tens of nodes in most of existing graph generative models).
 However, it ischallenging to directly infer the probability of selected actions for rollout; unlike in discrete domains where all actions can be exhaustively explored, in continuous domains, we cannot sample more than a subset of the effectively innumerable continuous action space.
 This way, it learns a compatibility matrix as normal parameters of deep neural network that represents the probabilities of label co-occurrences, as the compatibility function in CRF.
 Li et al., (2019) approach the problem with multi-turn question answering, posing templated queries to a BERT-based QA model (Devlin et al., 2018) whose answers constitute extracted entities and their relations and achieve state-of-the-art results on three popular benchmark datasets.
Finally, while our original motivation was to devise an empirically useful NAS method, a nice benefit is that CoNAS can also be theoretically analyzed, since existing theoretical results for Fourier-sparse Boolean functions can be ported over in order to provide upper bounds for the required number of performance evaluations of subarchitectures of the one-shot model.
 2 for some representative interpretation methods.
 The geometry pertains to counting a small sphere packed in an ellipsoid, on which is based the percolation theory we use.
 More generally we give promising evidence to suggest that our visualization method is of interest for model diagnostics and interpretability.
 Thus, we† Public Repo URL annonymized for review purpose-See code folder for detailed implementationdirectly pass features extracted by each layer to the final GLM layer.
The proposed method, referred to as semantic pruning, is performed as follows: we start from a CNN trained to distinguish q classes.
 Actually, the prerequisites of these attacks are hard to obtain in real-world tasks.
 We train a deep learning model to minimize the proposed loss in an unsupervised manner without the need for any labeled datasets.
To resolve these problems, we propose BERT-AL (BERT for Arbitrarily Long Document Understanding) model that extracts local features by applying parallel multi-layer Transformers into chunked input and employs multi-channel LSTMs to capture global information crossing Transformers.
 All of them cannot solve the problem well.
 First, we propose a novel pre-training approach to drive molecular representations to better retain alternative reaction possibilities.
 Our model uses binary number representations for data values, and separates the notion of control (which part of the input to consider) from execution (what to compute) via a conditional masking mechanism.
 We can think of these policies as clairvoyant experts, i.g,, experts that think they know the latent MDP and offer advice accordingly.
Methods for getting multiple generators to generate disconnected manifolds can be divided into two categories: (i) imposing information theoretic losses to encourage output from different generators to be distinguishable (Khayatkhoei et al., 2018; Hoang et al., 2018) (ii) changing the initial noise distribution to be disconnected (Gurumurthy et al., 2017).
 Under this new paradigm, OR and ML respectively work within disjoint space, being flexible and targeted, and clearly different from the two paradigms mentioned above.
 We benchmark against a discrete adaptation of Batch Constrained Q-learning (BCQ) (Fujimoto et al., 2018b), a recently proposed state-of-the-art BRL algorithm for continuous domains, and show that our Way Off-Policy algorithm achieves superior performance in both a traditional RL domain, as well as in a challenging, underexplored, real-world reinforcement learning problem: using implicitly expressed human reactions in chat to improve open-domain dialog systems.
 Instead, we plan through a sequence of semantic meaningful sub-goals.
 Unfortunately, using RNNs in this way causes two problems.
 Given an initial estimate of kidney via existing algorithms, our method effectively evolves the initial estimates and achieves improved kidney segmentation, as we show in Figure 1.
In order to achieve this, we curate a massive corpus of Python programs collected from GitHub.
Another direction of addressing logical reasoning problems via machine learning is to learn heuristic decisions within traditional decision procedures.
 Early works like Xie et al., (2016) replace ground-truth labels with noise while Reed et al., (2014) uses other models’ outputs to prevent over-fitting.
 We propose a multi-scale architecture which performs data dependent factorization to decide which dimensions should pass through more flow layers.
 Some previous works propose multi-step training (Luo et al., 2019; Asadi et al., 2019; Talvitie, 2017); however, experiments show that model learning fails to benefit much from the multi-step loss.
 Formation discovery uses unaligned data to learn an optimal formation template; during role assignment a bipartite mapping is applied between agents and roles in each frame toproduce “aligned data”.
We introduce Sparse Entity-Centric Transitions (SPECTRA), an entity-centric action-conditioned transition model that embodies the fact that the agents actions have sparse effects: that means that each action will change only a few slots in the latent set and let the remaining ones unchanged.
 Such representations extract information into a compact form which makes it possible to generate samples with specific characteristics(Chen et al., 2018; Bouchacourt et al., 2018; Tran et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2016).
 Without the sub-action connection, the learning process becomes partial observable Markov Decision Process (MDP) (Sutton & Barto, 2018), which is hard to generalize a good policy for the lack of information.
 For a smaller , however, the formulation in (1) does not explicitly pose any conflict between the pursuit of robustness and accuracy.
 We also target a method that can operate over each data point separately without assuming homogeneous assumptions across a massive dataset.
 5: Construct a pseudo-gradient gt := ∑K k=1 1 σ ( f(wt + σv k t )− f(wt) ) vkt .
 In this example, the query image (A) has a high activation on both the eyes and mouth areas, but the overall map of the retrieved image (B) only highlights the eyes.
 Specifically, to solve the retrosynthesis problem, we design an improved Graph Neural Network(GNN) called Graph Attention with Edge and Skip-connection (GAES) to learn each atom’s representation, andtry four strategies to incorporate it with the original SMILES representation in the encoder.
Our goal is to discover topics for the d words that help predict survival times of unseen test subjects.
 We explicitly encourage our model to factorize the reconstruction task into separate foreground and background reconstructions, where only the foreground reconstruction is conditioned on learned landmarks.
 Whereas the classic jackknife satisfies neither the coverage nor the discrimination requirements (Barber et al., (2019b)), DJ provides strong theoretical guarantees on both (i.g,, DJ generates confidence intervals resembling those in the rightmost panel of Figure 1 with high probability).
 However, there has not been many research in developing powerful inference process inmodern deep graph-structured models (Graph Neural Networks).
 This process can be done by a method as simple as using word overlapping metrics (e.g, ROUGE, BLEU or whether a sentence contains some certain keywords).
 The proposal of Kraska et al., uses this score and treats query x with score s(x) higher than a pre-determined threshold τ (high confidence predictions) as a direct indicator of the correct membership.
 To ensure differential privacy in DPLTM, we use a three-tiered approach.
 Our main contribution is threefold:
 We also plan to open source our code to advance research in this space.
First, we show that, from a worst-case perspective, even an extremely accurate model (with ε average KL divergence from the true distribution) may have generated text with a substantially different entropy rate as compared to the true distribution.
 This assessing procedure is highly flexible without human supervision nor re-training the base network, so it can be adapted to any existing base.
 The proposed method has several advantages compared with other black-box methods (Petsiuk et al., 2018; Zintgraf et al., 2017; Fong & Vedaldi, 2017).
 Ideally, when facing states with zero dependency on the current action, our model can learn to distribute all the reward into the importance sampling estimator, where the reward can be ignored; when those states yield extremely large Cπ , our model can learn to distribute part of rewards into the Monte-Carlo estimator to reduce the potential high variance caused by importance sampling.
Instead of removing the inhibited channels, we present an alternative perspective by proposing a novel building block, named Channel Equilibrium (CE), to recover and equalize the inhibited channels by encouraging channels to contribute equally in the feature representation learning process, thus enhancing the representation and generalization of CNNs.
 The key observation is that, conditioned on knowing z1:T as well as v1:T , we can marginalize out s1:T in linear time using the forward-backward algorithm.
 The peer sample evaluation returns us a favorable property that expected risk of peer loss turns to be an affine transformation of the true risk of the classifier defined on the clean distribution.
 We emphasize this is not an exact replica of the code from our experiments, but a demo to build intuition and clarify our methods.via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).
 The percentage of parameters increases to 54%, when parameters are not shared between the first and third components.
 This paper provides an answer on how a topology should be selected.
 This indicates the existence of some highly-cited papers(in the right bottom corner), which have impacts on multiple communities.
 To alleviate this problem, one usually chooses a smaller base learning rate for adaptive gradient methods than SGD with momentum.
 This means that the network can often achieve a low tracking loss by detecting the most salient object in the center of the search image.
 Second, joint optimization introduces further coupling between the architecture parameters and supernet weights.
 Besides, we do not discriminate saliency maps and masks, as both indicate the permutation of relevance scores of each input.
 The low-level mechanism underlying these operations is essentially convolution, and we inherit the parameter-sharing efficiencies of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
 Consequently, CSC has attained much attention from researchers (Zeiler et al., 2010; Bristow et al., 2013; Heide et al., 2015; Gu et al., 2015; Sreter & Giryes, 2018; Garcia-Cardona & Wohlberg, 2018a).
 This is typically achieved by constructing a robustified dataset where the new (perturbed) images are constructed by adding non-robust features to the clean images, and then performing model training using the perturbed images in place of the original ones.
Bayesian optimization is an effective tool to minimize function for global optimization or hyperparameter tuning.
 We validate our proposed method with image classification tasks on CIFAR10,CIFAR100 and ImageNet.
 It significantly improves the classification accuracy for white-box PGD attacks upon the second best method by more than 40% on the SVHN dataset from 46.90% to 93.80%, and more than 20% on the challenging CIFAR-10 dataset from 60.15% to 86.05%.
 Moreover, using different metrics to evaluate different desirable properties may hinder the process of model selection, as there may not be a single model that surpasses the rest in all measures.
 Besides, balancing between input resolution and network width can achieve better accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs.
 As shown in Figure 1, thePrevious Methods are Ad-hoc to Quality of Physics Our Method Handles a Range of Quality of Physicsgoal of PhysicsNAS is to handle a diverse range of quality in the physical prior or data.
 We show that ErrPs of an observer can be learned for a specific game, and the definition used as-is for another game without requiring re-learning of the ErrP.
 Theoretical results and practical experiments prove the strength of our algorithm.
 This general notion is already amenable to non-binary sensitive attributes.
 This ideal f∗ is a functional of the true but unknown distribution underlying our data, and our information concerning f∗ is limited by the real data we have collected.
 Furthermore, the SDGM can be embedded intoneural networks (NNs) such as convolutional NNs and trained in an end-to-end manner with an NN.
 For more quantitative metrics for measuring unsmoothness, please refer to Appendix A for details.
 Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior causal structure reconstruction and prediction performances of GASER.
 In this scenario, the traditional VAE is no longer applicable, because of the inherent one to many mapping between the latent code and the set elements.
 Importantly, it is also possible to run MCMC process on some combination of energy functions to generate images that exhibit multiple factors or multiple objects, in a globally coherent manner.
 The cluster outlier case is is likely to arise when the outliers represent a small minority class or when they are caused by a systematic error.
 We extract these keywords in the same way as Wang et al., (2019).
 In particular, we show that we can learn an adversarially robust model which generalizes well if we have plenty of unlabeled data, and the labeled sample complexity for adversarially robust generalization in Schmidt et al., (2018) can be largely reduced if unlabeled data is used.
 To tackle this issue, constructing pairs within a mini-batch is widely used in practice.
 Our proposed VSAE tries to address the challenges above by learning from partiallyobserved training data.
Contributions.
 Subsequently, we fix the mask for the rest of the training to speed it up.
How can one generalize graph convolution operations to construct analogous building blocks employed by modern lattice CNN architectures, such as strided, transpose and dilated convolutions, as well as skip connections? To address this question, we present a novel learnable graph convolution architecture defined over bipartite graphs that allows the input and output vertex sets and the edges between them to be specified in a flexible and learnable manner.
Related Work Freeman & Bruna (2016) is one of the first studies to rigorously prove that one hidden layer rectified networks are asymptotically connected and established relevant bounds.
 Then, for sufficientlysmall ε > 0, we obtain R(fSn) ≤ Rm(fSn) + √ Cn! mεp +O(log(1/ε)),with probability at least 1−O(ε).
 Also, “deep” refers to many hierarchical latent variables, while “shallow” refers to few latent variables.
 To this end, we derive Lipschitz bounds of commonly-used invertible building blocks for their forward and inverse maps.
 Importantly, our new framework reveals a fundamental trade-off between accuracy and robustness for guiding better choices of smoothing distributions.
 .
 This enhances the generalizability of models to diverse graph structures.
In this work, we propose a statistically valid technique for model-agnostic saliency estimation, and prove its consistency under reasonable assumptions.
 SIFT detects scale-space (Lindeberg, 1994) extrema from input images, and selects stable extrema to build robust descriptors with refined location and orientation, which achieves great success for many matching and recognition based vision tasks before CNN being reborn in 2012 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2012).
 To do all that, we first need to formally define both information of the weights and of the activations.
 Therefore, we leverage the distances in the randomly projected space to learn the desired features.
 Specifically, given a decision based attack A, our algorithm maintains a pool of solutions and at each iteration we run A for m steps on each solution.
Due to such effect, sample-selection methods can learn correct patterns at early stage and then use the obtained discriminative ability to filter out corrupted instances in subsequent training epochs (Jiang et al., 2018; Han et al., 2018b; Chen et al., 2019).
 We make the assumption that l is conditionally co-dependent on information embedded in scene image i and in other similar, neighboring image j such that the problem is formulated as probability of the form in Eq. 2,P (li|Si,Sj) = Πmi=1P (li|si, sj) (2)where sj is image for a neighboring tile that is most similar to index tile i andP (li|Si,Sj) is observed probability distribution.
 Concurrently, Kos & Song (2017) propose another heuristic that attacks when the action appears rewarding to the agent.
Decision States in Empowered Agents.
decision boundary in such a scenario would be as shown in Figure 1b.
 We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on benchmark Mujoco simulated control tasks.
Comparing with recent works (Pathak et al., 2019; Shyam et al., 2019) that maintain an ensemble of dynamic models and use the divergence or disagreement among them as an intrinsic reward for exploration, our implicit modeling of the posterior has several advantages: Firstly, it is a more flexible framework for approximating the model posterior comparing with ensemble-based approximation where the number of particles is fixed.
 In this work we propose a simple data augmentation method that overcomes this trade-off, achieving improved robustness while maintaining clean accuracy.
 Our results show that SOP and IG match the sample-efficiency and robustness performance of SAC, including on the more challenging Ant and Humanoid environments.
 As a result, we manage to extract winning tickets 5× faster by training on a subset of data, with no modifications to the core algorithm.
 To see this, we write the approximation of the marginal log-likelihoodlog p(x) = log ∫ p(x|z)p(z)dz ≥ −KLq(z|x)||p(z) + Eqlog p(x|z), (1)where KLq(z|x)||p(z) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to posterior probability q(z|x) and prior p(z).
 A signal averaging operation on the candidates is then performed in order to increase the robustness of the signal to noise and interference.
 Finally, we study the behavior of compressed generators when pruned with different amounts and types of sparsity, finding that filter pruning, a technique commonly used for accelerating image classification networks, is not trivially applicable to GANs.
 Moreover, training on additional CC and SBU data (containing unseen images/text in downstream tasks) further boosts model performance over training on COCO and VG only.
Recently, many stochastic variance reduced methods (e.g, SAG (Roux et al., 2012), SVRG (Johnson & Zhang, 2013)) and their accelerated variants such as (Defazio, 2016; Allen-Zhu, 2018) have been proposed to accelerate stochastic gradient methods for convex optimization.
 By coupling policy learning with representation learning, we find that CRL allows us to get better policy visual representations simply by applying better visual representation learning algorithms to the model.
 Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) introduced by Finn et al., (2017) is a solely gradient-based Meta Learning algorithm, which runs in two connected stages; metatraining and meta-testing.
 To the best of our knowledge, there are no successful studies for our problem setting (i.g,, less over-parameterized two-layer neural networks with smooth activation functions for the classification problems with logistic loss) in the literature.
Our contributions.
MaskGAN (Fedus et al., 2018), DpGAN (Xu et al., 2018), FMGAN (Chen et al., 2018) and RelGAN (Nie et al., 2019) are proposed.
 The statistics of the dataset (VG-Zero) in this work are shown in fig. 4
We furthermore propose a Wasserstein GAN architecture for learning distributions of pointclouds, e.g, molecular structures invariant to rotation, translation, and permutation.
 Extensive empirical evidence on handwritten digits and Click-Through-Rate prediction (CTR) domain adaptation problems illustrate the benefit of the proposed model.
 Assume that we have a hallucinator to generate additional examples from the original small training set.
 With SDIM, we could perform classification with rejection (Nalisnick et al., 2019; Geifman & El-Yaniv, 2017).
 Their choice seems inevitable since an algorithm that generates a solution based on a single feed-forward pass of DNN is potentially hard to train due to large variance in reward signals coming from high dimensional solutions.
 While the second term is the typical objective studied in goal-conditioned RL (Kaelbling, 1993; Andrychowicz et al., 2017), maximizing the diversity of goals is crucial for effectively learning to reach all possible states.
Motivated by our analysis of interpolation in linear regression, we propose a new estimator for data augmentation based on X-regularization (Section 6).
 Then, in Section 6, we present and discuss the properties of the proposed Evolutionary-Neural agent by applying it to a synthetic task.
 In addition, they reduce the width uniformly across all layers, which ignores differences in the importance of different layers.
 To show this, we introduce a new learning-to-cluster2 method called Centroid Networks which achieves surprisingly high accuracies on Omniglot and miniImageNet without using any labels at meta-evaluation time.
 In Figure 1, we show example predictions of MNIST handwriting stroke of our CF-VAE.
We validate VAENAS with various search space on two benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10 and ImageNet) for image recognition.
In this paper, we aim at tackling the problems mentioned above by proposing an efficient hierarchical meta-RL method that realizes meta learning high-level goal generation and leaves the learning of low-level policy for independent RL.
 Our contributions are as follows.
To address these issues, in this paper we propose three techniques that improve the performance of GEM.
 See Section 4 for more details.
 One of the popular methods is to design a scalar reward that properly weighs the importance of each objective.
 Our contributions facilitate DP-SGD learning as follows:
This paper provides the following contributions:
 The method works by introducing a loss term that penalizes the entropy of the activations at training time and applying entropy encoding (e.g, Huffman coding) on the resulting activations at inference time.
 Apparently, if a GAN knows the boundary between different classes, it may be able to generate instances which are close to the boundary with correct labels.
An added benefit of our effort is computational – depth parallel MCTS on local trajectory segments is much faster than traditional sequential MCTS to generate demonstrations.
 As shown in Figure 1, there is a small number of SLW and the indices of encoded SLW are allocated in storage, unlike TW.
 To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first analysis of privacy benefits of causal models.
 In experiments on1D regression tasks, we validate that SNP which simply attends on the memory buffer of all the past context points under-performs the proposed ASNP endowed with imaginary contexts.
 For example, when we implement DSGD on parameter server, the server needs to receive p high dimension vectors from workers, which will lead to communication traffic jam and make the convergence of DSGD slow.
 We choose the MNIST data set because it is the simplest widely used example of a structured data set on which neural networks show significantly different behaviour than when trained on synthetic data of the vanilla teacher-student setup.
 Specifically, we direct our experimentation on the bandwidth-limited channel dueto it’s ubiquity as a fundamental component in the real world communication systems.
 In the case of large mathematical corpora, the interpretation of failures may be a hard task because of multiple failures and the complicated structure of the corpora, requiring specialized domain knowledge both in mathematics and with regard to the inner workings of the proof system.
 Finally, we show how the validity constraints baked into the generator can be enabled or disabled during inference using ideas from InfoGANs Chen et al., (2016).
 We directly estimate the ratio using a network with a controlled Lipschitz constant, which leads to significantly improved stability.
 In this work, we propose a principled, unsupervised, probabilistic method to simultaneously tackle the challenge of detecting outliers x∗ in input space X (without directly relying on likelihood estimates) as well as outliers z∗ in latent space Z.
 Altogether these twofold improvements are formulated as a fully differentiable neural network.
 This convergence rate matches the one for TD-learning with linear function approximation and constant stepsize (Bhandari et al., 2018).
 See Figure 1 for a cartoon illustration.
 Our main insights are twofold:
Of course, some recent state-of-the-art model-based RL methods (Hafner et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019) have demonstrated superior sample efficiency to leading model-free approaches on pixel tasks from (Tassa et al., 2018).
 Dilate loss forms the major component of the method, which generates a perturbation that maximizes the Euclidean norm of the activation vector (before the nonlinearity) at a given layer (Section 3.2).
 See Section 3 for further detail.
 Our approach is flexible: it can be applied to arbitrary mechanism design problems, including analytically intractable settings.
 Thanks to the information brought by the weak annotations, we here justneed a very small set of accurate segmentation masks, cf. bottom left part of Figure 1.
 Similarly, extreme multi-label learning could be used to predict which subset of search engine queries might lead to a click on a webpage from its title alone for scenarios where the webpage content might not be available due to privacy concerns, latency issues in fetching the webpage, etc.
3. We propose “ZeroInit”, a simple change to the initialization scheme of residual networks, designed to preserve the correlation between gradients at the start of training.
 However, very often, a time-series follows a seasonal behavior.
A successful example of such an approach is the adversarial method BiGAN (Donahue et al., 2016; Donahue & Simonyan, 2019).
 Somewhat surprisingly, our evaluation shows that the best performing pixel-level OOD detection methods were derived from image-level OOD detection methods that were not necessarily the best performing on the image-level OOD detection task.
 Thus, anomaly monitoring algorithms to be designed in these platforms must be highly efficient.
We experimentally demonstrate that the new reward function enables an agent to explore the state space more efficiently in terms of covering larger areas in less time compared to the earlier methods.
LISTA (Gregor & LeCun, 2010) unrolls the iterations of ISTA into a feed-forward neural network with weights, where each layer implements an iteration: h(l)t = φγ(l)(W (l)h (l−1) t + U(l)xt), with W(l) = I − 1cD TATAD, U(l) = 1cD TAT, and γ(l) being learned from data.
 This makes our approach more expressive, not less, while still able to efficiently learn the chosen structured factors.
 In the meantime, research on deep semi-supervised learning is very active, bringing significant progress (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017; Laine & Aila, 2017; Iscen et al., 2019; Verma et al., 2019).
 This makes it possible to evaluate recognition accuracy of different varieties of entities, achieving much more fine-grained analysis than standard corpus-level measures.
However, the problem becomes difficult when the city becomes large.
 There is no substantial evidence that the gen-erated speech is perceptually good.
 Because of the novelty of the problem, it was not obvious to what baselines we should compare.
 The objective of MCMAE is designed based on the two requirements presented above.
 We do this by exploiting Monte Carlo simulations under which rounding effects are randomized.
 Some contemporary approaches for matrix completion fall under the umbrella of geometric deep learning.
 The neuro-inspired learning, in particular, spiking neural network (SNN) with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is an alternative and unsupervised approach to learning features in input data (Hebb et al., (1950);Bi & Poo (2001); Diehl & Cook (2015); She et al., (2019a); Querlioz et al., (2013); Srinivasan et al., (2016)).
Contribution:
 In summary, the paper contributions are the following:
 The local image content is illustrated by a small square around it.
 We provide a theoretical analysis that shows that OC-MAML explicitly optimizes for parameter initializations which yield performance increase on class-balanced test data by taking only a few gradient steps with one-class minibatches.
 By zeroing out rectangular blocks of the weight matrix, we will restrict how these node blocks interact with the events and with one another.
One promising solution to the problem of reducing communication costs of data-parallel SGD is gradient compression, e.g, through gradient quantization (Dean et al., 2012; Seide et al., 2014; Sa et al., 2015; Gupta et al., 2015; Abadi et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016; Alistarh et al., 2017; Wen et al., 2017; Bernstein et al., 2018).
 For example, Philipp et al., (2017) showed that deep fullyconnected tanh-networks could be trained after the kernel reached its large-depth, data-independent, limit but that these networks did not generalize to unseen data.
 While in this work we limit the definition of attributes to simply refer to ‘class labels’, future work might build on a broader interpretation.
Work on orthogonal models typically focuses on the properties of an orthogonal parameterization at the backward step, to address the vanishing gradient.
Recently, hierarchical abstractions as a learnable neural network module surfaced in the literature of graph representation learning.
 Inspired by Ke et al., (2018) which introduce sparse credit assignment to the LSTM model, we propose a novel model called Explicit Sparse Transformer which is equipped with our sparse attention mechanism.
 Sparsely connected networks have shown the capacity to retain very high test accuracy (Frankle & Carbin (2019); Han et al., (2015)), increased robustness (Ahmad & Scheinkman (2019); Aghasi et al., (2017)), with much smaller memory footprints, and less power consumption (Yang et al., (2019)).
 Therefore, we argue that image processing systems should also aim at better machine recognizability.
We consider here unsupervised video reconstruction.
 This retains the diversity of ensemble member predictions which is otherwise lost in knowledge distillation.
The key contributions of our work are three-folds:
 This setup excludes any hope for brute force strategy and implies that a perfect planner is out of reach.
 We treat semantic layouts as input attributes and use the image editing model (Hong et al., 2018) pre-trained on Cityscape dataset (Cordts et al., 2016).
 We illustrate qualitative examples for parallel greedy decoding across languages and sampling from the joint distribution of the 4 languages.
 We show that the proposed Adaptive Filter can better capture graph topology and separate features on both real-world datasets and synthetic datasets.
 Traditionally, basis functions are hand-crafted (e.g, Fourier basis).
 For example (see Figure 1), a profit-driven algorithm might engage in upselling: persuading users to purchase or click on items they originally had no interest in.
 For instance, when predicting CTR in a social network, two users in the same basketball group have a large probability to click the same advertisement of basketball shoes since they are supposed to have similar hobbies for basketball.
 FICM generates intrinsic rewards based on the prediction errors of optical flow estimation (i.g,, the flow loss).
 An illustrative overview of our model is shown in Figure 2.
 It produces comparable accuracy to that of DFT while also improving the computation time by 5 orders of magnitude.
There are three major contributions of this work:
This paper proposes a novel approach for encoding the measure of safety in scenarios where the explicit safety cost is not available, or the states are interfered by severe uncertainties.
 More precisely, our approach computes the direction of the subspace spanned by the evaluated search directions that is most aligned with the true gradient.
 In turn, the network produces control parameters for a lower-level control policy that can be run on a robot to synthesize the corresponding motion.
In this paper, we try to bridge this gap with special attention on cluster structured sparse recovery.
To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose an Iterative Deep Graph Learning (IDGL) framework for jointly learning the graph structure and the GNN parameters that are optimized towards the prediction task at hand.
 In a sense, it finds the even split of the data projected onto the normal direction of the hyperplane and places the hyperplane there.
 The key components of this step are abstract transformers.
 We show that the time complexity of this model is nearly the same as that of deep DNNs.
In addition, we propose a novel low-loss path finding algorithm to find barriers between partner minima.
 The teacher sub-network takes the intermediate representation from the student sub-network as input to make the prediction.
g, in a short and/or small collection.
 We evaluate four popular policy optimization algorithms, namely SAC, PPO, TRPO, and the synchronous version of Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), on multiple continuous control tasks.
 In the first scenario, we assume that for the segmentation task, there is already a pre-trained DCNN with the same class mapping.
 Firstly, distributions of latent variables of DiVA are clustered class-wise discriminatively on the latent space by introducing mutual information maximization between latent variable z and class condition c.
 On four simulated robotic tasks, experimental results show that our LTS can discover both primitive skills and transitional skills, successfully perform the transition between primitive skills that are distinguishable, and achieve a better peformance in comparison to the state-of-the-art baseline DIAYN.
 In a puzzle, given the source code of a function f in a fixed programming language (e.g, Python), the goal is to find an input x such that f(x) returns True.
 This provides an insight into the training efficiency of the unbounded asymmetric activation functions such as ReLU.
 It is pointed out that the main reason is that the direct optimization of a regularization penalty term causes divergence from the original loss function and has negative effect on the effectiveness of gradient-based update.
 The object-oriented representation of ROOTS is more interpretable, composible, and transferable.
In this work, we enable scalable distributed training across different geographical locations with long distance and high latency network connection.
The game behind GANs: For convex-concave games, Nash equilbria provide a natural solution concept.
 Unfortunately, the visualizations are subjective and lack of necessary theoretical justifications.
 In model-free reinforcement learning, accomplishing tasks through random exploration is sample inefficient and hardly generalizable.
 The assumption is that attributes that tend to indicate same classes should have strong relations.
In this paper, we remove such inherit bias by taking a different perspective on the input perturbation.
 It tries to classify whether its input is fake or comes from the training dataset.
 This viewpoint suggests that providing negative signals throughout the learning process would be beneficial to enhance the OOD discriminative power of the system.
Neuroscientific evidence (McClelland et al., (1995), O’Neill et al., (2010)) has inspired another set of methods which focus on the replay of previously seen samples along with new samples to avoid catastrophic forgetting.
 In the next generation, the allele frequencies will change slightly, depending on how each allele of each gene fared cumulatively (over both all inputs and all genotypes containing it) in the classification task.
 In addition to explaining model predictions, such disentanglement can be useful for the comparison of the representations the model acquires to linguistic knowledge.
Meanwhile, a recent line of work (Jacot et al., 2018; Du et al., 2018b; Li and Liang, 2018; Chizat and Bach, 2018) has shed light on new approaches to analyze neural networks.
 Although optimizing least squares regression is a basic problem, it has been shown to characterize the learning dynamics of many realistic deep learning models (Zhang et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019).
 We can use the index c∗ as the compressed representation of zc∗ .
A key part of our analysis leverages a new perspective on deep networks provided by Balestriero & Baraniuk (2018a;b).
 Furthermore, there are some methods to estimate the quality of states.
 To address this challenge, we formulate this problem as risk minimization (Vapnik, 1992) for reinforcement learning, and propose regularization objectives to enforce generalization of policy to unseen actions.
 1.Semi-supervised boosting (Fujino et al., 2005; Blum & Mitchell, 1998; Laine & Aila, 2016; Grandvalet & Bengio, 2005) uses semi-supervised algorithms (e.g, clustering) to generate ar-tificial or proxy labels and boost accordingly (which we compare with).
In RL, the objective is to maximize the cumulative sum of rewards.
 2) various targeted attacks on general NLP tasks are possible (e.g, when attacking QA, we can ensure the target to be a specific answer or a specific location within a sentence); 3) the transferability based blackbox attacks are successful in NLP tasks.
 First, to tackle the problem of the curse of dimension and exhaustive storage when selecting the least visited states, we approximate the visitation counts via prediction errors given by Random Network Distillation (Burda et al., 2019b).
 Besides, the concise architecture of VAE is more preferred in this scenario.
 To solve this, we develop a universal representation space where all task-specific representations get mapped to and all target tasks can be inferred from.
 In summary, our contributions are as follows:
 To guarantee the semantic consistency between the generated and real features, AGMC-HTS reconstructs the keywords in the input documents that are relevant to the conditioned codes.
In this paper, we aim to learn representations of signals or images from irregularly-sampled observation datasets.
Through a series of theoretical and empirical analyses, we shed new light on the representations that model agnostic meta-learning algorithms learn and how they adapt to unseen tasks.
 Then the networks can betrained in an end-to-end fashion.
 Edges can carry informative multi-dimensional attributes (namely weights) which are fundamental to graph matching.
 The local structures anchored around each node as well as the attributes of nodes therein are jointly encoded with graph convolution (Defferrard et al., 2016) for the sake of high-level feature extraction.
 Since soft Q-learning is an off-policy algorithm, the agent does not necessarily have to visit the demonstrated states in order to experience positive rewards.
Overall, the main contributions of our paper can be summarized as follows:
 To enable using the triplet loss with soft pseudo labels in our MMT framework, we propose a novel soft softmax-triplet loss so that the network can benefit from softly refined triplet labels.
 Ensemble Q-learning and Averaged Q-learning (Anschel et al., 2017) take averages of multiple action values, to both reduce the overestimation bias and the estimation variance.
 This includes multinomial and binomial classifiers supervised by the model likelihood or whether the argmax is already correct as well as simply thresholding the model score (§3).
 The transformed `1 regularizer formulated as ∑N i=1 (a+1)|wi| a+|wi| manages to smoothly interpolate between `1 and `0 by tuning the hyperparameter a (Ma et al., 2019).
 Since such a ranking is usually treated as training data for the NAS sampler in the search phase, this further explains the small margin between random search and the NAS algorithms.
 The expected cardinality of the DPP is easy to compute and differentiable, which allows us to use it as the objective to optimize the DSF to enable diverse trajectory sampling.
 This amounts to the stochastic subgradient descent method and usually exhibits slow convergence.
Our main contributions in this paper are:
 In this work, we address these two issues in the expensive coordination problem through an abstraction-based deep RL approach.
 Notice that node degree only describes the number of neighbors of each node, but does not say how these neighbors are connected among themselves.
 Kulesza & Taskar (2011b) explicitly expressed the kernel with κ(x,y) = σ1σ2δ(x)>δ(y), where σ measures the intrinsic quality of the feature and δ(·) is function mapping input x to a feature space.
 To learn the meta-knowledge graph at meta-training time, for each task, we construct a prototype-based relational graph for each class, where each vertex represents one prototype.
 The two variational distributions provide an estimate of the negative log-likelihood of the MRF.
 For example, Krishnamoorthi (2018), which quantizes the weights and activations to 8-bit, directly use 32-bit accumulators to cache the intermediate values or partial results to avoid overflows.
 To achieve this, we propose a weakly supervised learning based clustering framework.
 At each arrival of a task to a network with APD, which we refer to as APD-Net, it will try to maximally utilize the task-shared parameters and will learn the incremental difference that cannot be explained by the shared parameters using sparse task-adaptive parameters.
 Our modelling ideas can also be applied to other continual learning frameworks, see the Appendix for a brief discussion.
 Thus, we gain insights on how feature distributions evolve with layer depth and architecture.
 As CNN architectures are becoming deeper, it is infeasible to employ rule-based domain expertise or conventional DRL-based techniques to explore the exponentially enlarging search space of kernel-wise network quantization.
 Fast and stable convergence is observed for the architectures with wide and shallow cells.
 In our implementation, we design generative models to infer the hidden variables, however, the distribution of the latent variables is conditioned on previous hidden states.
 While the shifting of the distribution mode to the incorrect class is detrimental to the voting prediction, the resulting distribution of softmax contains features that is useful for correcting the prediction.
 In other words, a fair percentage of weights concentrate around the mean (peak area); and a few weights are of relatively high magnitude and out of the quantization range (called outliers).
 Then, feature components A and B are independent with each other, and they are termed inconsistent features.
 This view-independent information can be projected into a novel view using the reconstructed geometry, where new view-dependent effects can be added.
 Some recent theoretical results partially answer this question, such as deriving adversarial risk bound (Athalye et al., 2018), relating it to the distributionally robust optimization (Sinha et al., 2018), and characterizing trade-offs between robustness and accuracy via regularization (Zhang et al., 2019).
 (ii) Symbolic Reasoning: the verification requires symbolic execution on the table structure.
 ES is also capable of learning linear and other compact policies (Section 4.2).
 Further, we investigate NUTM in few-shot learning by using LRUA as the MANN and achieve notably better results.
 However, in the case of visual planning, optimizing over subgoals corresponds to optimizing within the space of natural images.
 To reflect these practical constraints in NSC, we assume 1) each agent is connected to a limited numberof neighbors and communication is restricted to its neighborhood, and 2) training is offline and global information is available in rollout training minibatches, despite a decentralized training process.
 Here, we propose a new graphical attention mechanism not only for computation but also for interpretation.
 Compared to passive defense by directly classifying the inputs (Zhang et al., 2018; Lamb et al., 2019), it would be more effective to actively defend adversarial attacks by breaking their locality via the globally linear behavior of the mixup-trained models.
Similar to our attempt to induce high-density regions in the feature space, previous work has been proposed to improve intra-class compactness.
 Following this line of work, we begin by explicitly defining the notion of incremental learning for a toy model which exhibits this sort of behavior.
 This can be seen by observing that it is more difficult to obtain order from disorder: it is, after all, difficult to reach a state with a vase intact from one with it broken, rather than vice versa.
 Finally, they are capable of recovering their brain structures within days after brain injury (Kishimoto et al., (2011); Kizil et al., (2012)).
 This sparsity, in turn, would decrease the accuracy and confidence of predicting counterfactuals at those regions.
 1Furthermore, even when the real data distribution has a single mode, ambiguous data (e.g, a human face image with mismatched eye colors) can still present.
 The original BoxWorld is played on a rectangular grid populated by keys and locked boxes of varying colours, with the goal being to open the box containing the “Gem”.
 After receiving a demonstration illustrating a new goal, the meta-trained agent can learn to accomplish that goal through a small amount of trial-and-error with only binary success-or-failure labels.
 In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
 In SSL, the training data consists of unlabeled samples in addition to the labeled samples.
 From this perspective, adversarial examples generated from misclassified examples are “undefined”.
 Each of the k reconstructed inputs has equivalent probabilities of being the original input for the attacker.
 The step size η1, the momentum parameter γ ∈ (0, 1) and the compensation parameter η2 are independent of t.
 Finally, it demonstrates the importance of image transformations in learning such low-level features as opposed to image diversity.
We first investigate whether disentanglement scores are sample efficient and robust to imprecise labels.
 For this architecture, there exists a ReLU network hθ : Z → R, or equivalently a setting of the weights θ , (W1,b1, . ,WL,bL), such that for any ‘general’ ReLU network hη : Z → R (with the same architecture) satisfying hθ(z) = hη(z) for all z ∈ Z, there exist permutation matrices P1, .PL−1, and positive diagonal matrices M1, . ,ML−1, such thatW1 = M1P1W ′ 1, b1 = M1P1b ′ 1, Wl = MlPlW ′ lP −1 l−1M −1 l−1, bl = MlPlb ′ l, l ∈ {2, . , L− 1}, (5) WL = W ′ LP −1 L−1M −1 L−1, bL = b ′ L,where η , (W′1,b ′ 1, . ,W ′ L,b ′ L) are the parameters of hη .
 Typically, this is done by enlarging the model with new hidden states and a new predictor (Figure 1a).
 Furthermore, we show that the identity information is largely encoded in the angle of the embeddings and that it can be recovered by a nearest neighbour lookup after a learned linear mapping from hidden to input token space.
In this paper, we explore MBRL algorithms from a different perspective, where we treat the planning at each time-step as an optimization problem.
 Empirically, the proposed algorithm outperforms the prior work in the number of environment interactions needed to achieve near-optimal success rate.

 We find that victim policies in higher-dimensional Humanoid1Corresponding author.
 This induces Markovian dynamics on the latent state of the system, replacing the standard unconditional prior distribution.
 Specifically, the contribution of this work is threefold.
We test our model on two practical NLP problems that require entity knowledge: Question Answering (QA) and fine-grained Entity Typing.
 Editable Training employs modern meta-learning techniques (Finn et al., (2017)) to ensure that model’s mistakes can be corrected without harming its overall performance.
 Second, to model intermediate state, we propose a novel snapshot mechanism that feeds limited memory states into the graph (Section 3.2).
 We summarize our main contributions as follows:
 This fact motivates us to present the DSGAN, which can generate unseen data by adopting seen data as training samples (see fig.  9, which illustrates the difference between GAN and the DSGAN, in Appendix A).
To address these limitations, we propose to leverage the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition of the objective function for AUC maximization with a deep neural network.
 Salman et al., (2019) proposed SmoothAdv to improve the robustness of g, but it still relies on the expensive attack iterations.
 With this attack we are able to create undetected adversarial examples, but we show that this attack is less successful in fooling the classifier than a non-reconstructive attack.
 Numerical result shows that the P3S-TD3 algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms both in the speed of convergence and in the final steady-state performance.
 Then we propose a three-phase neural iterated learning algorithm (NIL) and a probabilistic explanation of it.
 TREMBA uses global information of the source model, capturing high level semantic adversarial features that are insensitive to different models.
 A classifier that is harder to be falsified in MAD is considered better.
 First of all, the performance measure cannot be a straightforward extension of the sample complexity defined above (See Strehl & Littman (2008) for detailed discussion).
 Intra-class variabilities due to geometric image transformations such as translations or small deformations are linearized by a scattering transform (Bruna & Mallat, 2013), which avoids unnecessary learning.
The size of the coreset, and consequently the number of remaining neurons in layer i, is provably related to the approximation error of the output for every neuron in layer i + 1.
 This strategy is inspired by Yun et al., (2019b) but we have made significant and non-trivial development.
 We conclude the paper in Section 6.
 Thus, neither BSP nor ASP consistently outperforms the other on different models and datasets Zinkevich et al., (2009); Dutta et al., (2018).
 However, RFM does not consider from the perspective of the influence of each action on other agents.
 As a building block, we use the pose representation provided by the DensePose framework by Rĩza Alp Güler (2018), unmodified.
 Specifically, given an example x, a label l is verifiably among the top-k labels predicted by the smoothed classifier gk(x + δ) when the `2-norm of the adversarial perturbation δ is less than a threshold (called certified radius).
1 reward and the right action yields +1 reward.
 The backbone of VL-BERT is of (multi-modal) Transformer attention module taking both visual and linguistic embedded features as input.
 Since adapting the theoretical receptive field is not the goal but a means to adapt the ERF, why not directly tune the ERF to specific data and tasks at runtime?Toward this end, we introduce Deformable Kernels (DKs), a family of novel and generic convolutional operators for deformation modeling.
In this work, we investigate the explicit modelling of the distribution over the ensemble predictions, rather than just the mean, with a single model.
 To overcome gradient staleness, Zhang et al., (2015b) proposed Staleness-Aware (SA), which penalizes the step size of stale gradients linearly to their delay.
 Generative models require a different approach, as the downstream effect of changes in intermediate representations are high dimensional.

 For KBs with many relations, a reified KB can be up to four orders of magnitude faster than alternative implementations (even alternatives based on sparse-matrix representations), and in our experiments we demonstrate scalability to a KB with over 13 million entities and nearly 44 million facts.
 We further prove that our semantic model is sound (i.g,, truth assignments for the formulas are consistent with their discrete counterparts) and complete (i.g,, all formulas can be represented) with regard to the discrete SMT formula space.
 However, the effectiveness of reversible models remains greatly unexplored in the video literature.
 For data points whose options can be selected correctly without knowing the contexts and questions, we classify them as biased ones.
 We argue that such specifications about the robustness properties of learned representations can be one of the tractable guiding features in the search for good representations.
 We do so by observing that, under commonly used distributional assumptions, training a stochastic encoder–decoder pair in VAEs does not differ from training a deterministic architecture where noise is added to the decoder’s input.
 A two-level reallocation space is conducted to reallocate the computation across different resolution and spatial position.
 Lastly, our method does not affect and does not depend on the training of the agent and thus is applicable to a wide variety of reinforcement learning algorithms.
 Theoretical analysis demonstrates that SAdam achieves a data-dependent O(log T ) regret bound for strongly convex functions, which means that it converges faster than AMSgrad and AdamNC in such cases, and also enjoys a huge gain in the face of sparse gradients.
 Our GNN consists of a graph isomorphism network (GIN) Xu et al., (2019) as a feature extractor Fθ(.) to generate graph embeddings; on which subsequently acts our classifier C(.) comprising of two components: (i) Csup: a MLP layer to learn and predict the super class associated to a graph, and (ii) CGAT : a graph attention network (GAT) to predict the actual class label of a graph.
 Though IRL does not have the error compounding issue, its computation is very inefficient.
 The attacker can also continue the crafting process to trigger all target classes.
 By fixing the pre-trained parameters, we can adapt the model to a new domain with only a little cost.
 Finally, the model proceeds to perform attention with subtree masking where the attention score between a nonterminal query and a key is activated only if the key is a descendant of the query.
 Such games capture the fundamental difficulties of general mean-field games and well approximates a variety of real-world systems such as power grids (Minciardi and Sacile, 2011), swarm robots (Fang, 2014; Araki et al., 2017; Doerr et al., 2018), and financial systems (Zhou and Li, 2000; Huang and Li, 2018).
 These networks have a number of important features that are useful in resource constrained environments, like embedded devices or mobile phones (McDanel et al., 2017; Kung et al., 2017).
 If the critic is successful in this, then matching the generator to the true data in the lower dimensional space will also match the distributions in the original space.
 We also design a specific video-level inference algorithm for V4D.
In summary, our main contributions are two-fold:
 Empirically, we compare the semi-supervised variant of our method to prior techniques for learning from preferences.
1 First, we will undertake a theoretical investigation to elicit the connection from k to a lower bound of expected performance, as well as to the intrinsic dimension of the learned embedding space.
 Burgess et al., (2019) and Greff et al., (2019) recently proposed two such models, MONet and IODINE, to decompose visual scenes into meaningful objects.
 However, the maximum modes of Ghosh et al., (2018) are restricted by the number of agents, and the replication increases memory as well as computational cost.
 In other words, are GANs “steerable” in latent space?1 We analyze the relationship between the data distribution on which the model is trained and the success in achieving these transformations.
 In this work, we propose an end-to-end method to learn an active learning strategy for semantic segmentation with reinforcement learning by directly maximizing the performance metric we care about, Intersection over Union (IoU).
 Turning to the blackbox setting and iterative optimization schemes, Narodytska and Kasiviswanathan (2017), without using any gradient information, use a naive policy of perturbing random segments of an image to generate adversarial examples.
We introduce Deep SAD (Deep Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection) in this work, an end-to-end deep method for general semi-supervised AD.
 Importantly, the globally optimal solution may not even be achievable in our budgeted setting.
 The beginning of each inner-loop (i.g, each epoch) computes a batch of sample pseudogradients so that each subsequent inner loop iteration modifies only one sample pseudo-gradient in the batch pseudo-gradients to reduce the variance.
 While this objective may be used in the traditional way to estimate data distribution ratios that are then input to an RL algorithm, we go further to show how the specific form of the derived objective renders the use of a separate RL optimization unnecessary.
 (Please see equation (2.2) for a formal definition of the margin, and Theorem 2.1 for a formal version of bound (1.2).) To further highlight the good statistical properties of the all-layer margin, we present three of its concrete applications in this paper.
 Both token and sequence level unlikelihood training are shown to improve metrics that measure dullness and repetition of the model, while maintaining performance in other metrics such as perplexity or token accuracy compared to the maximum likelihood baseline.
 This setting provides a strong privacy guarantee for each task-owner that sharing θ̂t with the meta-learner will not reliably reveal anything about specific training examples to any downstream agent.
META-DATASET aims to improve upon previous benchmarks in the above directions: it is significantly larger-scale and is comprised of multiple datasets of diverse data distributions; its task creation is informed by class structure for ImageNet and Omniglot; it introduces realistic class imbalance; and it varies the number of classes in each task and the size of the training set, thus testing the robustness of models across the spectrum from very-low-shot learning onwards.
The retrieval algorithm can be put into two categories.
 Finally, we derive families of tasks that we can provide to the inference framework.
 In synergy with the curriculum, the credit function is constructed via function augmentation from the critic in Stage 1.
The data-driven mechanisms implemented by deep neural networks to perform denoising are almost completely unknown.
 In total, these four techniques can have a surprisingly large effect, improving accuracy by over 6% on one of our benchmark datasets while only changing the usage of Batch Normalization layers.
 First, they can be used to inform safety critical decision making.
Experimental results show that PG achieves significant compute reduction and accuracy improvement on both CNNs and LSTMs.
 The results, reported in Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 2, show state-of-the-art reconstruction quality using orders of magnitude fewer parameters than other methods.
 Similar to MAML, such a good initial meta-architecture for adaptation should be more sensitive to changes in different tasks such that it can be easily transferred.
Our contributions are as follows:
 Our contributions are thus as follows:
 FS is quantization friendly so as to achieve significant compression ratio.
 The contributions of our work can be summarized as follows:
Furthermore, we devise a clustering algorithm by leveraging local elasticity of neural networks.
It is instructive to work through the proposed mechanism in the context of a simple thought experiment.
We then use the PAI task, followed by a task involving finding the shortest path and finally bAbi to investigate what kind of memory representations effectively support memory based reasoning.
 Fertility denotes the number of times each input token is copied to form a sequence as the input to the decoder for non-autoregressive decoding.
 The combination of low pass filtering and slowly time varying input has a significant bearing.
 Therefore, it’s a tough but necessary task to restore the performance of BN in small batch training without introducing any nonlinear operations in inference procedure.
 Following the typical formulation of single-agent bandit learning, we consider the task of regret minimization (Lai et al., 1987; Dani et al., 2008; Bubeck et al., 2012).
 Subjects who were allowed to sleep exhibited a more complex understanding of the overall shape of the maze (Wamsley et al., (2010)).
 More specifically, we consider the training of L-hidden-layer deep linear ResNets with fixed linear transformations at input and output layers.
 To reduce the complexity in the highly multivariate case, we consider an alternative set of hidden variables that are designed to work well as latent variables for a variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2014).
We implemented our new architecture as a tool called LAMBDANET and evaluated its performance on real-world TypeScript projects from Github.
 To mitigate this problem, we propose a new loss function, relativistic identity cGANs (relidGANs) loss, with modification of the relativistic GANs (JolicoeurMartineau, 2019), allowing us to generate the face with a more distinct identity.
 (2) Unsupervised 3D moving object detection (Figure 3-right): Our model can detect moving objects in 3D without any human annotations, by forming a 3D feature volume for each timestep, then estimating the motion field between volumes, and clustering the motion into objects.
We conduct extensive experiments to compare the aforementioned instantiations of the decoupled learning scheme with the conventional scheme that jointly trains the classifier and the representations.
 We specifically focus on robustness to model misspecification in the transition dynamics.
 (a) circles represent weight parameters, initialized by distributions with mean and variance values randomly sampled from Ɲ(0,0.
 When we employ the 0-1 loss, because of the equivalence between the classification risk and the worst-case classification risk, we can directly minimize theclassification risk under the corrupted training distribution instead of minimizing the worst-case classification risk.
 This requires a novel adaption of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to the federated setting with user-level DP guarantees.
 The second objection, i.g,, separate activity and error channels, is attenuated by Direct Feedback Alignment (Nøkland, 2016) which drastically reduces the number of channels carrying an error signal.
 Although these models can handle sparsely located data points without explicitly given physics equations, they are purely data-driven so that the physics-inspired inductive bias for exploiting finite differences is not considered at all.
 1Available at github.
 For variance reduction involving discrete variables, one potential solution is to combine the Gumbel-softmax trick, which relaxes the discrete variables to continuous ones, with reparameterization to produce low-variance but biased gradients (Jang et al., 2017; Maddison et al., 2017).
 This is a rather weak notion of convergence, as it does not guarantee that the iterates converge to a point, and even if the iterates do converge, the limit is a stationary point and not necessarily an minimizer.
 It is simply applied to the output features of each layer (except the last one) consisting of simple operations, in particular centering and scaling, that are linear in the input size.
These two choices of regularization are well motivated with clear intuitions.
 We test our method on image generative models for three factors of variation of an object in an image: vertical position, horizontal position and scale.
In this paper, we here give an alternative (arguably simpler and more revealing) derivation of the MSP algorithm (3).
 Such sensors operate as a consumer radar, providing decimeter-level location accuracy.
 That learning is coupled with f (k) could further offer possibilities for expressing certain functions with parameters of lower complexities, or generalizing better, as f (k) is no longer a linearized model.
To learn approximate Nash equilibrium for IIGs in an end-to-end manner, Heinrich et al., (2015) and Heinrich & Silver (2016) propose eXtensive-form Fictitious Play (XFP) and Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP), respectively, based on deep reinforcement learning.
 Given that context disambiguation is no longer necessary, this result suggests that our fine-tuning procedure is able to align BERT at the type level to a degree that matches non-contextual approaches.
 Concretely, each input-output example (x, y) consists of a device screen x ∈ R4 and a set of n views y ∈ Rn×4, all of which are represented using their coordinates in a two dimensional euclidean space.
 In Section 6, the method is used for a 30-state system consisting of identical vehicles, coupled via a known collision avoidance policy.
 However, in practice, it suffers from early saturation and local minima.
 Would the hyperparameters for training from scratch still be useful for fine-tuning? In addition, most of the hyperparameters (e.g, batch size, momentum, weight decay) are frozen; will the conclusion differ when some of them are changed?With these questions in mind, we re-examined the common practices for fine-tuning.
 However, generative models only learn p(x).
 The proposed RGBD image generation can be achieved through a simple extension of recently developed image generation models.
 We then experimentally compare various training methods addressing under-sensitivity: i) standard training ii) data augmentation iii) adversarial training iv) IBP-verified training and v) entropy regularisation, and evaluate their effectiveness against nominal (test) accuracy, adversarial accuracy, IBP-verified accuracy and a verification oracle.
 All in all, the prime contributions of this paper are as follows:
 However, note that the loss functions used in those works do not explicitly try to capture correlations or higher-order dependencies in representational space.
 Through adversarial learning, we can train the target network more efficiently and robustly.
 Secondly, a single training instance may need to cover largely different test instances with its perturbation, since we do not know which test instances will be given at test time.
 Preprocessing methods modify the training data to remove discriminatory information before passing data to the decision-making process Calders et al., (2009); Feldman et al., (2015); Kamiran & Calders (2010; 2009; 2012); Dwork et al., (2012); Calmon et al., (2017); Ruggieri (2014).
 In particular, aligning datasets across different conditions is a very important problem in biology, especially in single cell analysis (Butler et al., 2018), where we often have annotations that certain cluster of cells in a dataset corresponds to one cell type (e.g, B cells and T cells) based on known marker genes (Schaum et al., 2018).
 First, we randomly sample a collection of candidate mixedblocktype architectures that satisfy the parameter budget.
 Some of the measures are motivated by generalization bounds such as those related to VC-dimension, norm or margin based bounds, and PAC-Bayesian bounds.
 Therefore, we need to propagate linear bounds differently for self-attention layers.
 An immediate corollary of this theorem is Corollary 1.
 While a larger batch size in general increases throughput, it may negatively affect the final accuracy on both the train- and test-set.
Combining these losses, we arrive at the CycleGAN loss defined as L(G,F ) := Df ( F∗µ‖ν) +Df ( G∗ν‖µ) + αcyc · Lcyc(G,F ),where the factor αcyc > 0 determines the weight of the cycle consistency term.
1Note that, this tendency is very consistent with other test points and is observed throughout the entire learning process (even before the training).
 By DropEdge, we are actually generating different random deformed copies of the original graph; as such, we augment the randomness and the diversity of the input data, thus better capable of preventing over-fitting.
 As a result, our model, without modifying the model architecture or the hyper-parameters, can perform image translation tasks not only requiring holistic changes but also requiring large shape changes.
 Our contributions are as follows:
 Furthermore, we investigate a parameter-restricted approach with a single parameter per candidate sample, balancing tractability and exploration (Kool et al., 2019).
 In contrast, we collect real user-defined graphs spanning a broad set of tasks, architectures, and datasets.
 The learned Neural SLAM module produces free space maps and estimates agent pose from input RGB images and motion sensors.
Quantized DNNs are characterized by the use of lower numbers of bits to represent DNN datastructures like weights and activations (Venkataramani et al., (2014); Hubara et al., (2017); Zhou et al., (2016); Courbariaux et al., (2015)).
 Furthermore, we show that the amount of word-piece overlap in B-BERT’s training data contributes little to performance improvements.
 Thus, SPACE provides an object-wise disentangled representation of foreground objects along with explicit properties like position and scale per object while also providing decomposed representations of complex background components.
However, for directed graphs the asymmetry of graph shortest path distances dG(vi, vj) 6= dG(vj , vi) is violating the symmetry assumption (not a metric function).
 We consider the threat models where the adversary is allowed to manipulate an agent’s observations or actions with small perturbations, and we propose a two-step algorithmic framework to find efficient adversarial attacks based on learned dynamics models.
Another desirable property of our approach is that our agents are able to learn to outperform the demonstrators, and in some cases even to discover strategies that the demonstrators were not aware of.
 However, unlike our proposal, these methods do not make full use of the unlabeled data in query set.
 In the case of faces, this content includes: head pose, facial expression, etc.
 These do not rely on wet lab experiments, and thus allow for large-scale benchmarking across a range of methods.
 The complex dependencies between subtasks (i.g,, preconditions) enforce agent to execute all the required subtasks before it can execute a certain subtask.
 We refer the latterquantity as a hidden reconstruction of the input.
 The key idea of the proposed method is to solve the point cloud learning problem as a flow advection problem jointly defined in a Eulerian world space and a Lagrangian material space.
 All of these experimental results clearly demonstrate StructBERT’s exceptional effectiveness and generalization capability in language understanding.
 In this work, we begin to address the above question in IB settings.
For the efficient exploration of the new search space, we propose a NAS framework named AtomNAS which applies network pruning techniques to architecture search.
In order to overcome the intractability of MI in the continuous and high-dimensional settings, Alemi et al., (2017) combines variational bounds of Barber & Agakov (2003) with neural networks for the estimation.
 By stacking this primitive, we build Lite Transformer for mobile NLP applications.
 Roughly speaking, the cost is captured by:‖f‖R ≈̇‖R{∆ (d+1)/2f}‖1 ≈ ‖∂d+1b R{f}‖1 (2)whereR is the Radon transform, ∆ is the Laplacian, and ∂b is a partial derivative w.r.t. the offset in the Radon transform (see Section 3 for an explanation of the Radon transform).
 More concretely, we address the challenge of open and growing vocabulary problem with continual learning.
 An inverse model of the imitator dynamics is learned to recover the action; 2) Deviation Correction.
 Then, we learn a grouping policy that seeks to progressively group sub-parts and gradually increase recognition context.
These semantic transformation-based adversarial perturbations shed light upon the understanding of what information is important for DNNs to make predictions.
 In light of this intuition, we hypothesize a well-trained discriminator should also be regularized to have the consistency property, which enforces the discriminator to be unchanged by arbitrary semantic-preserving perturbations and to focus more on semantic and structural changes between real and fake data.
 Care is needed in order to obtain a rate of the form 1/δO(d), rather than, say, 1/δO(d/δ).
The second limitation is that previous models including SQAIR lack any form of background modeling and thus only cope with scenes without background, whereas natural scenes usually have a dynamic background.
The main insight to our approach is that unlike a benign user, a model stealing attacker additionally uses the predictions to train a replica model.
 Our experiments demonstrate that our Domain Adaptive Multibranch Networks, which we will refer to as DAMNets, not only outperform the original technique of Ganin & Lempitsky (2015), but also the state-of-the-art strategy for untying the source and target weights of Rozantsev et al., (2019), which relies on the same domain classifier.
 Intriguingly, Schwarzer (2000) found that this effect exacerbates with age (adults suffer from this effect much more than children), but, adults are much faster and accurate in detecting mono-oriented objects in usual orientations.
 They learn the bitwidth with reinforcement learning, i.g,, they learn an optimal bitwidth assignment policy.
The final problem that we tackle is to remove the bias that the auxiliary model causes relative to our original softmax classification.
 Random priors are easy to train and were found to work very well in practice (Burda et al., 2018).
 More recently, a new generalization bound based on Fisher-Rao norm was proposed (Liang et al., 2017).
 Simulating a common cloud computing scenario, our attacker has a co-located VM on the same host machine as the victim DL system, and shares the last-level cache with the victim (Liu et al., 2015).
 The multiple-iteration training effort with exploding memory requirement (for backward pass computations) has limited the applicability of spike-based backpropagation methods to small datasets (like CIFAR10) on simple few-layered convolutional architectures.
 The first encourages the model to be faster by directly minimizing the average latency.
Our main contributions are thus summarized as follows.
 The discussion above hence prompts two questions regarding the neurons: which neurons should we transfer source knowledge to, and which are actually important to the target model?Yet traditional transfer learning methods fail to provide answers to both, as generally they transfer knowledge either equally for each neuron with the same regularized weights, or determine the strength of regularization using only the source dataset (Li et al., 2018).
 In this paper, we delve deeply into the foundation of (L)ISTA and discover possible weaknesses of LISTA.
3 (general case) and 4 (GCN case) for precise statements.
 Furthermore, the handcrafted features of graph kernels lead to high dimensional, sparse or non-smooth representations and thus result in poor generalization performance, especially on large datasets Narayanan et al., (2017).
 For example, the black-box success rate was even improved from 52.52% to 62.10% when the attack skips the last two residual modules (following the path in green color).
 In summary, our contributions are primarily three-fold:
In this paper, we tackle the domain generalization problem for recognizing novel category in the few-shot classification setting.
 Chaudhry et al., (2018), for instance, provide such a combination of memory replay and selective synaptic plasticity.
 We demonstrate both in theory and on two real-world experiments that together with the conditional alignment, BER helps our algorithm to simultaneously ensure accuracy parity and equalized odds across groups.
 However, among all three categories, the most commonly used strategy is class-based, as pointed out by Yu et al., (2015) and Yu & De Koster (2013).
 This focus gives us an opportunity to link GNNs with declarative and well understood formalisms, and to establish conclusions about GNNs drawing upon the vast amount of work on logic.
 Further, the corresponding objectives are determined naturally by principles of probabilistic inference, reducing the need for empirical search directly in the space of possible objectives.
 When a new successful strategy or mutation emerges, it changes the implicit task distribution neighboring agents need to solve and creates a new pressurefor adaptation.
 Here the node represents the sum of the feature maps and each edge is associated with an operation transforming the feature maps from the source node to the target node.
Finally, the contributions of this work are as follows.
Our contributions are
 However, the label assigned by this rule on unseen instances may not be as reliable as the explicit label on this specific exemplar it generalized.
 DimeNet outperforms previous GNNs on average by 76 % on MD17 and by 31 % on QM9.
 Zhang et al., (2016) reported that such explicit regularization does not have much effect but implicit regularization induced by SGD (Hardt et al., 2016; Gunasekar et al., 2018; Ji & Telgarsky, 2019) is important.
 In contrast, in our paper we focus on understanding how the delay affects the selection of the solution we converge to, and changes in this selection can impact generalization.
 An INN always has a latent space of the same dimension as the data.
 In parallel, recent theoretical results by De Sa et al., (2018) show that sparsity and the notion of structure in linear maps are fundamentally linked: any given matrix can be factored into a product of sparse matrices with total parameter count equal to the efficiency (i.g, minimum arithmetic circuit complexity) of the matrix.
 To our best knowledge, this is the first step taken towards exploiting winning tickets for a realistic efficient training goal.
 We show that the combination of skip connections and batch normalization is critical for this trend in ResNets.
 We combine it with a variant of the masked language modeling objective and show that the resulting representation performs better, particularly on tasks such as question answering and linguistics acceptability (§5).
 In MPNNs, the neighborhood is defined as the set of all neighbors one hop away (e.g, GCN), or all neighbors up to r hops away (e.g, ChebNet).
 While FedAvg actually works when the data are non-iid McMahan et al., (2017), FedAvg on non-iid data lacks theoretical guarantee even in convex optimization setting.
 When the MLE objective compares its predicted and ground-truth sequences, it takes a once-for-all matching strategy; the predicted sequence is given a binary label, either correct or incorrect.
So far, to the best of our knowledge, branching rules adopted by BaB based verification methods are either random selection (Katz et al., 2017; Ehlers, 2017) or hand-designed heuristics (Wang et al.,2018b; Bunel et al., 2018; Royo et al., 2019; Bunel et al., 2019).
 For the Q matrix of dimension |S| × |A|, at each value iteration, SVP randomly updates a small portion of the Q(s, a) and employs ME to reconstruct the remaining elements.
 This result is in stark contrast to the previous view that the central PPO clipping method drives the gains seen in Schulman et al., (2017).
 Further analysis of each component reveals that the improvement is due to the effectiveness of the balancing terms for handling task and class imbalance, and out-of-distribution tasks.
 They also assist folding into 3D structures (Fechter et al., 2001) and thus should not be ignored.
• Approximate attention computation based on locality-sensitive hashing replaces the O(L2) factor in attention layers with O(L logL) and so allows operating on long sequences.
A second challenge consists in how to automate exploration of high-dimensional, continuous initialization parameters to discover efficiently “interesting” patterns, such as SLPs, with a limited budget of experiments.
 We developed two approaches to learn the parameters of the bottleneck \\u2013 either using a single sample (Per-Sample Bottleneck), or the entire dataset (Readout Bottleneck).
 The predictions thus obtained are then combined in a manner that ensures that the result reflects agreement among them.
1 This is achieved by extending the theory of learning on sets to include functional representations, which in turn can be used to express any translation-equivariant NP model.
 However, IRL can have difficulty learning a useful model because the expert demonstrations usually only cover a small portion of the true dynamics.

 In step (ii.), we develop an approach around the manifold invariance concept of (Roussel, 2019) to perturb the elements of the learned manifold while ensuring the perturbed elements remain within the manifold.
 They are conceptually introduced as follows:Emphasis focus.
 Very interestingly, a promising avenue for future research has been set by recently proposed models that automatically learn the data transformations (Hauberg et al., 2016; Lemley et al., 2017; Ratner et al., 2017; Antoniou et al., 2017).
 The direct consequence is that one can control the bias in the Straight-Through estimator by manipulating the higher-order Taylor coefficients of f(z).
 Fortunately, the accuracy loss can be almost eliminated by using a great many Trees and carefully choosing the sharing parameter \\u2013 X (see details in Section 3.2).
 This can result in underfitting with conventional distillation techniques, leading to suboptimal performance (Hinton et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2019).

 Such a framework constructs a closed loop between the target CF model and the virtual user, synthesizing user feedback as side information to improve recommendation results.
 While prior work 3 established the relationship between momentum and depth, we show a direct relationship between depth-induced momentum and the scale of the output value.
 Since it has been shown that Gaussian noise can be adversarial (Bibi et al., 2018) and that such noise is widely studied in applications such as image processing, we restrict the focus in this paper to the case whereD is Gaussian.
 This interval bound propagation (IBP) is inexpensive and simple; however, it results in very loose output interval bounds, which in turn necessitates a complex and involved training procedure.
In parallel, researchers have reported selective units in the hidden layers of various CNNs trained to classify images into one of multiple categories (Zhou et al., 2015; Morcos et al., 2018; Zeiler and Fergus, 2014; Erhan et al., 2009), for a review see Bowers (2017).
 The applications started to spring up due to the incoming of the event-based cameras composed of Dynamic Visual Sensors(DVS) (Shi et al., 2018).
 The analysis is based on the over-parameterization of the networks, which allows for guaranteed descent while the gradient is non-zero.

 Basically, if a latent feature learned at a certain timestep has large uncertainty (variance), we can consider its knowledge as unreliable.
 The Pre-LN Transformer puts the layer normalization inside the residual connection and equips with an additional finallayer normalization before prediction (Please see Figure 1 for the differences between the two variants of the Transformer architectures).
 To further examine the practical behavior of AII, we first analyze the behavior of AII from the lens of the variational approximation.
 This matches the data generation process: version (a) has a significantly smaller parameter change than (b), as shown in the inset graph on the right.
 The horizontal axis denotes the ratio of reduced training loss, and the vertical axis denotes that of the test loss.
 Key to our method, both stages share the same decoder, thereby causing the localization stage to guide the decoder to improve its attention mechanism.
 And we assume that {wk, k = 0, 1, · · · }, {vk, k = 1, · · · } and the initial state x0 are jointly independent.
 It is impossible to predict all input cases and the test data may diverge from what the system has seen before.
 It starts from the shallowest backbone network and gradually grows sub-modules (A sub-module can be one or more layers, e.g, a residual block); the growth stops once a stopping policy is satisfied.
 However, in real-world applications, there are only a small fraction of input instances requiring deep representations (Wang et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2017a).
 Based on our derivation, the direction of the mixed stochastic gradient balances the loss on old tasks and the new task in an adaptive manner.
 Our results show that for future research on lifelong learning, it is important to design algorithms bearing adversarial attacks in mind.

 In other words, a small generalization error guarantees that the generated distribution is close to the real data distribution.
”, the word ”room” refers to the aspects Room, Cleanliness and Location.
 Thus, the model which can cope with texts of various lengths and levels is needed, especially deep models of complicated texts.
 So the existed algorithms should be heuristic or it can get a bad result even we train the neural networks with lots of datasets.
 Thus they need to modeled differently.
 In the brain, the RPE is signaled by neuromodulatory systems that project diffusely to many synapses so that they can inform them about the RPE (Schultz, 2002); the second factor is an attentional feedback signal that is known to propagate from the motor cortex to earlier processing levels in the brain (Roelfsema & Holtmaat, 2018; Pooresmaeili et al., 2014).
 In fact, even a partial planner can help improve the expressivity of the policy.
 Our approach is inspired by the work of Meshry et al., (2019) which utilizes a staged training strategy to re-render scenes under different lighting, time of day, and weather conditions.
 According to our human evaluation experiments,this leads to better interpretability, since the model’s behaviour is better understood by looking at the selected image regions when a particular word is generated.

Different from TS-GLM, our proposal framework called ”Path Planning” (TS-PP) is quite straightforward to combat the curse of dimensionality by a serial processes that operates sequentially and focuses on one dimension at each component process.
 Furthermore, the decomposed filters reduce the overall computations significantly compared to previous works, where computation typically grows linearly with the number of domains.
 This softer learning approach inherently makes the model more robust to temporally misaligned labels.
 NODEs have the advantages of adaptive evaluation, accuracy-speed control by changing error tolerance, and are free-form continuous invertible models (Chen et al., 2018; Grathwohl et al., 2018).

 The attention based fitting is inspired by the recent findings (Clark et al., 2019) that the attention weights learned by BERT can capture substantial linguistic knowledge, which encourages that the linguistic knowledge can be well transferred from teacher BERT to student TinyBERT.
Training a meta neural network to predict the accuracy of neural architectures is a challenging task.
 This is a manifestation of our two previous findings.
In this paper, we present a framework for disentangling a small number of control variables from the rest of the latent space which accounts for all the additional details, while maintaining a high quality of the generated data.
 There have been a number of studies in this direction (see section 2), some of which use a normalizing flow parameterization, where the prior is modeled as a trainable continuous bijective transformation of the standard Gaussian.
 Second, we propose a self-supervised disentanglement model for extracting the content and style from each reference subsequence respectively.
 The first requirement is the enlargement of the receptive field as far as possible so that the network can obtain more context information, which is critical to solving the mismatching problems in the discontinuous disparity area.
 Compared to LASER, our method improves computational efficiency by an order of magnitude for both training and inference, making it suitable for resource or latency-constrained on-device cross-lingual NLP applications.

 To alleviate this problem, researchers have proposed a variety of approaches such as storing a few samples from previous datasets (Rebuffi et al., 2017), adding distillation regularization (Li & Hoiem, 2018), updating the parameters according to their usefulness on previous datasets (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017), using a generative model to produce samples from previous datasets (Kemker & Kanan, 2017).
 Therefore, the reconstructed image needs to be further processed to obtain a higher quality image.
 We need to design this partitioning carefully so that all the attributes of a latent representation are well mixed through stacks of mapping layers.
 In this paper, we propose the Frobenius norm of the effective value of weight parameters as one such metric.
 This is true, despite the activations of the two networks being very different.
 Label noise: With SE-SNN, per-activation uncertainty can be easily aggregated to produce per-instance uncertainty.

 While the logit contains the probabilistic information over classes, the feature map, the output of convolution layer, has more meaningful and abundant feature information on image intensity and spatial correlation.
 However, these models cannot handle the GDA task as the label distribution is not well aligned.
 Indeed our goal resembles similarity to property elicitation (Lambert et al., 2008; Steinwart et al., 2014; Frongillo & Kash, 2015b), but we emphasize that our aims are different - property elicitation aims to elicit statistical properties of a distribution, while ours focus on eliciting samples drawn from the distributions.
 Secondly, gradient perturbation can release the noisy gradient at each iteration without damaging the privacy guarantee as differential privacy is immune to post processing (Dwork et al., 2014).
 In this paper we show that a similar simple scaling strategy, applied to the standard deviations of the output distributions, can calibrate regression algorithms as well.

 When training with domain randomisation for transfer, bootstrapping via asymmetric information has displayed crucial benefits (Pinto et al., 2018).
 The other option is to incrementally update the Lagrangian, looking at one constraint at a time.
 In contrast, there are local SSL losses, where the loss is defined over each point individually, most notable of those approaches is the state-of-the-art Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT) (Miyato et al., 2018).
 This motivates the addition of typo noise to our training pipeline, which further improves the accuracy of the agent’s responses.
With an extensive set of experiments, we show that TriMap produces excellent results on a variety of real-world as well as synthetic datasets.
The notion of feature robustness proposed in this paper measures the robustness of a function f = ψ ◦ φ (e.g, a neural network) toward local changes in a feature space.
2 If there is labeled public data, the situation is even better, but this is likely to be rare and is not the setting we consider here.
 Our approach is flexible since it does not require the model to be analytically tractable and finds near-optimal policies through reinforcement learning.

In this work, we derive a global bound on the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of deep neural networks with differentiable activation functions (such as sigmoid, tanh, softplus, etc.).
 Different tasks will require different capacities to do well, so reducing average use requires effectively identifying which tasks will ask more of the model and which tasks can perform well with less.
 Moreover, by mixing environment reward with intrinsic adaptation rewards, we ensure that the agent quickly adapts and also learns to acquire skills beyond what the source policy can teach.

 This fusion breaks the limitation of BERT by the ability of capture unlimited sequential information from LSTM, and makes it be able to process arbitrarily long text.
In general, most LR images are produced through performing traditional interpolation method (mostly bicubic) on their HR fathers.
 Our approach is reminiscent of successful pre-training schemes in natural language processing (NLP) applications (Devlin et al., 2018).
 A reasonable strategy is to weigh these policy proposals by the belief and combine them into a single recommendation to the agent.
 Our approach falls into the second category.
 More importantly, as a general framework without complicated hand-crafted rules, this framework could not only be applied to the TSP, but also be easily extended to many other combinatorial optimization problems.
When a machine learning system interacts with humans, ideally we would like to learn about the humans’ preferences in order to improve its performance.
 Motivated by this observation, we put forward a novel two-layer hierarchical policy learning paradigm to deal with the sparse reward challenge.
 First, RNNs are typically trained via backpropagation through time, making them prone to the problem of vanishing or exploding gradients (Pascanu et al., 2012).
 On real life salient objects, in addition to contour evolution, we use our method to directly evolve the embedding of an input image into a pixel-wise dense semantic label.
 GitHub projects are known to contain a large amount of duplicate code.
 This direction is less appealing from a theoretical perspective, but more interesting from a practical one, since it has been shown to speed up SAT solvers in practical settings (Selsam & Bjørner, 2019).
 This idea was extended in Bagherinezhad et al., (2018) to an iterative method which uses logits obtained from previously trained versions of the same deep network.
 For the decision making, we introduce a heuristic based on the amount of total log-likelihood contributed by each dimension, which in turn signifies their individual importance.
 We attribute this outcome to the essence of super-vised learning, which elementally preserves only one-step transition and the similarity between real trajectories and the synthesized ones cannot be guaranteed.
 A major limitation in past approaches was the speed of the template discovery process.
For (1) and (2), we establish consistent findings for different standard architectures on CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky, 2009) and ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009).
 Motivated by works using Recurrent Variational AutoEncoders (RVAE) to model sequential data in neural language processing (NLP) and other areas (Bowman et al., 2015; Ha & Eck, 2017), we employ RVAE to perform temporal abstraction in RL.
 This is motivated by the physical consideration that agent interventions are localized in time and space.
 Additionally, these representations have been found to generalize better and be more robust against adversarial attacks (Alemi et al., 2017).
 Some methods generate all possible sub-action sequences at the same time, it is still non-trivial for a neural network model to produce many mutual related outputs in a single forward prorogation even though the setting of these methods are strict MDP.
 1 (lower), the visual characteristics of the attribute “beautiful” are notably different from each other when describing a sunset, an aurora, or a mountain.
 Note that Rrob(f) is an upper bound of the standard risk of f .
The question sounds unlikely to resolve at a first look, but we are inspired by the seminal work Bayesian Truth Serum (BTS) (Prelec, 2004; Prelec et al., 2017) which approached this question in the setting of incentivizing and aggregating truthful human judgements.

 Our contributions are as follows:
Central to the DJ procedure is the usage of influence functions — a key concept in robust statistics and variational calculus (Efron (1992); Cook & Weisberg (1982); Hampel et al., (2011)) — in order to estimate the parameters of models trained on LOO versions of the training data, without the need to exhaustively re-train the model for each held-out data point.
 Most graph-structured models still follow a fixed hand-crafted rule for performing inference over nodes.
 With the harvested hard-negative examples, we transform the original binary classification setting to a multi-task learning setting, in which we jointly optimize the original target objective of distinguishing positive examplesfrom negative examples along with an auxiliary objective of distinguishing soften positive examples (comprised of positive examples and hard-negative examples) from easy-negative examples.
 Queries with scores less than τ are passed to the back-up Bloom filter.
 In phase 1, we create the lottery tickets following the principles of the lottery ticket mechanism.
To summarize, the main contributions of this paper are the following:
 This yields a simple and effective method for automatically generating demonstrations without the need for an external expert, solving the planning problem by adapting the classic Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm (RRT) (Kuffner & LaValle, 2000).
 Indeed, we show that this worst-case amplification may occur for a variety of long-term properties of a probabilistic language model; this is because the one-step KL divergence does not in general provide tight control over the expectation of a bounded function.
 With our explicitly designed discriminability indicator on the training set, the distillation of such discriminability can be successfully performed with a lightweight discriminability distillation network (DDNet), which shows the superiority of our proposed indicator.
 First, GLAS provides scalability of explanation that we can achieve by adjusting the variance parameter of the Gaussian mask.
 Details of our method are described in Section 3, 4 and 5.
 To this end, a key observation from Eqn.
 In particular, we can efficiently compute the gradient of the log marginal likelihood, ∇ ∑ s1:Tlog p(s1:T |z̃1:T ,v1:T ), where z̃1:T is a posterior sample that we need for model fitting.
 In other words, peer loss is invariant to label noises when optimizing with it.
 We develop a novel method for stochastic optimal transport based on random feature maps (Rahimi & Recht, 2008) to produce compact and memory-efficient representations of learned behavioral test functions.
 The reader is encouraged to look at Table A.
Our contributions are as following:
 In Cluster-GCN, these highly-cited papers are randomly put into one community and the adjacency matrix is approximated by a block-diagonal matrix; i.g,, Cluster-GCN removes the fletching part of the arrow patterns in Figure 1.
 This makes the learning rate decay schedule less effective when applied to adaptive gradient methods, since a much smaller base learning rate will soon diminish after several rounds of decay.
Currently the prevalent approach adopted by many neural trackers is that of “tracking by detection” (Breitenstein et al., 2009).
 The greedy nature of the gradient based methods inevitably introduces bias during optimization and could easily mislead the architecture search.
2Explainability quantifies how easy it is to understand and reason about the explanation; faithfulness estimates the fidelity between the explanation and the decision behaviour of black-box classifiers.
 Our parameterizedfilters simply act across a spatially organized collection of memory cells, rather than the spatial extent of an image.
 However, very few studies focus on the validation of CSC for image SR (Gu et al., 2015), resulting in no work been reported that CSC based image SR can achieve state-of-theart performance.
 This procedure is essentially the standard adversarial training approach (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Madry et al., 2018), which has been shown to be effective for defending against adversarial attacks (Athalye et al., 2018).
 Bayesian optimization iteratively samples new point and fits the function values by a surrogate model based on Gaussian process.
 This makes it easy to simulate ensembles of systems in JAX MD.
 Comprehensive experiments on some backbone DNN models such as ResNet20, ResNet18, ResNet56 and MobileNetV2 show that the proposed cursor based quantization method achieves remarkably better performance of compression ratio with ignorable accuracy drop or even better accuracy.
The major contributions of this work can be summarized as follows.
 Our model is distinctly characterized by recursive parameterization of recurrent gates, i.g,, compositional flow is controlled by instances of itself, á la repeatedly and recursively.
 For supervised learning, verified training on the train-data enables us to provide similar verification guarantees for unseen test-data.
 In fact, it has recently been demonstrated that there is a natural trade-off between image quality and sample diversity (Yang et al., 2019), which calls into question how we might select the correct balance of these properties.
 For example, to meet a dynamic resource constraint from 13 MFLOPs to 569 MFLOPs on MobileNet v1 backbone, US-Net (Yu & Huang, 2019) needs a network width range of 0.05, 1.0 given a 224224 input resolution.
 Experiments in Section 4.3 offer support for this goal, where PhysicsNAS outperforms previous PBL methods on multiple physical tasks across a range of physical prior and dataset conditions.
 This is notably different from previous approaches (Chavarriaga & Millán, 2010; Salazar-Gomez et al., 2017), where the labeled ErrPs are obtained in the same environment (where the RL task is performed).
 The goal in TSC is to approximate the teacher prediction function g which maps from inputs to predictions z.
 To the authors best knowledge, there is no GMM that has both of sparsity and discriminability.
However, the attempt to handling unsmoothness is quite limited both at model and feature levels.
 In summary, our specific contributions are as follows:
 We show that Set-HBAE is able to be successfully applied to such a setting, and learns to reconstruct input sets in a semantically meaningful way, as well as generate new sets unconditionally by sampling from the latent code prior.
 There are several ways to combine energy functions.
To go beyond this problem of the pure reconstruction error, recent works have leveraged the distribution-mapping capabilities of generative models such as Variational Autoencdoers (VAEs) that encourage the data in the latent space to follow a prior distribution (19; 21).
We find that while Grad-CAM seems to perform best overall, it does suffer from drawbacks not reported in prior works.
 Next, given a pre-trained explanation generator, we use the proposed Variable-Constrained Beam Search (VCBS) algorithm to generate a phrase that best describes the relationship between the keywords by inferring the image (See fig. 1).
 First, we show that the expected robust risk can be upper bounded by the sum of two terms: a stability term which measures whether the model can output consistent predictions under perturbations, and an accuracy term which evaluates whether the model can make correct predictions on natural samples.
 Although it helps mitigate the computational and storage burden, slow convergence and model degeneration with inferior performance still commonly exist when using all pairs in a minibatch to update the model.
 By constructing an encoder for each modality independently, the latent representation selectively takes only the observed modalities as input, while a set of decoders maps the latent codes to not only full data (including both observed and unobserved modalities), but also a mask representing the missingness scheme.
 A detailed evaluation of various ingredients and parameters of the proposed method is presented.
 We propose Convolutional Tensor-Train LSTM (Conv-TT-LSTM), a modification of ConvLSTM, to build a higher-order spatio-temporal model.
 Our motivation came from the insight that having a fixed sparse multiply-accumulate pattern allows weight compression during training and can save compute and energy in hardware (Han et al., 2016).
 We claim the following contributions:
 The first one minimizes the distances between the corresponding Gaussian component means between the source and target data.
 Several recent numerical works have shown that parameterized curves along which loss is nearly constant can be successfully learned.
 Here, C > 0 is a constant independent of m and n.
VAE would be much more promising to scale to more complicated datasets than deep hierarchical VAEs.
 Leveraging our insight, we develop two new families of distributions for better certification results on `2 and `∞ attacks, respectively.
 .
To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on four standard benchmark datasets: Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed, which are citation networks for transductive learning, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) for inductive learning, in which test graphs remain unseen during training.
 Furthermore, our method passes the sanity checks given by Adebayo et al., (2018b).
 The scale-space extrema are efficiently implemented by using a difference-of-Gaussian (DoG) function to search over all scales and image locations, while the DoG operator is believed to biologically mimic the neural processing in the retina of the eye (Young, 1987).
 While testing exact consistencyis expensive, we introduce an efficient soft-consistency penalty that promotes consistency of new labels with earlier policy commitments.
 Intuitively, random mapping preserves rich local proximity information but may also keep misleading proximity when its underlying data distribution assumption is inexact; by minimising the random distance prediction error, RDP essentially leverages the preserved data proximity and the power of neural networks to learn globally consistent proximity and rectify the inconsistent proximity information, resulting in a substantially better representation space than the original space.
 The proposed Bayesian Optimization resampling (BO) and Successive Halving (SH) are then used to explore important solution space based on current information and cut out unnecessary solution paths.
 While the memorization effect is critical to the success of sample-selection methods, however, how to properly exploit it is not addressed in the literature.
We used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for modeling the observed probability distribution in Eq.2.
 However, since these heuristics are designed based on human knowledge, it is unclear whether there exist more effective key steps.
 We build on the VIC framework (Gregor et al., 2016) (Figure 1), where the core idea is to maximize the empowerment of an agent.
 We find that even though such a solution exists, the proposed training algorithm is unlikely to reach it.
The main contributions of our work include:
 We demonstrate the performance of MOCA on both regression and classification settings with unobserved task switches.
 Secondly, it is based on the principle of amortized SVGD (Feng et al., 2017), where the KL divergence between the implicit posterior and the true posterior is directly minimized in a nonparametric sense, and further projected to a finite-dimensional parameter update.
 Our contributions are as follows:
 This demonstrates a need to revisit the importance of entropy maximization in DRL.
 This is of particular interest because finding winning tickets is highly data, labels and resource-demanding since it requires training a network to convergence at least once (and generally dozens of times in practice).
 This lower-bound log-likelihood usually produces imprecise inference.
 Before the averaging procedure, a form of dropout is implemented on the signal candidates in order to reduce the amount of interference and noise correlation existing between the different candidates.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
 All these methods enjoy low per-iteration complexities comparable with stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and they also can attain improved convergence rates.
 As a result, we find that CRL obtains consistently good representations in policies across environment size and type, often beating many hard-coded domain specific objectives.
 Meta-training learns a sensitive initial model which can conduct fast adaptation on a range of tasks, and meta-testing adapts the initial model for a particular task.
 Most studies have focused on highly over-parameterized neural networks with ReLU activation, and less over-parameterized settings have been considered difficult for showing the global convergence property of gradient descent even in the few studies using a separability condition (Allen-Zhu et al., 2018a; Cao & Gu, 2019a;b).
 In this work, we make a step towards understanding the global behavior of GAN training, under multi-modal settings.
 They evaluate the generated text with Bleu and self-Bleu (Zhu et al., 2018) or LM socre and reverse LM score (Cı́fka et al., 2018), and claim these GANs improve the performance of generator.
 Under this distribution, the model tends to collapse to output few frequent predicates.
 To this end the data distribution as well as the generator distribution are represented in terms of Euclidean distance matrices.
The original contributions are the following:
 A precise hallucinator indicates that a classifier trained on both the hallucinated and the few real examples should produce superior validation accuracy.
 SDIMs reject illegal inputs based on off-manifold conjecture (Samangouei et al., 2018; Gu & Rigazio, 2014), where illegal inputs, e.g, adversarial examples, lie far away from the data manifold.
Contribution.
 Ourresults show that the method achieves better performance on a standard fine-grained classification benchmark (CUB dataset) and on our proposed benchmark consisting of a mix of fine and coarse-grained classification tasks, CIFAR-Hard.
 These tasks represent important use cases of geospatial point-cloud stream forecasting.
 In a new environment, acquiring such a maximum-entropy goal distribution is challenging: how can an agent set diverse goals when it does not even know what states exist?In this paper, we address this question via a new algorithm, Skew-Fit, which learns to model the uniform distribution over states, given only access to data collected by an autonomous goalconditioned policy.
 X-regularization encourages the data augmentedinterpolant to stay close to the original interpolant while fitting the extra augmented points.
In this paper, we propose a novel method that enables DNNs to flexibly change their size after training.
3 The method is very similar to Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017), but the key difference is that the labels of the support set can be reliably recovered through clustering whenever the cluster semantics are consistent across tasks.
Broadly, our results indicate that robust optimization is a promising avenue for learning representations that are more “aligned” with our notion of perception.
 On NASNET-like search space, we apply VAENAS on both gradientbased methods and one-shot methods.
 In particular, we demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art hypergraph-based neural networks.
 Intuitively, this is quite similar to how a human being behaves: we usually transfer the overall understanding of similar tasks rather than remember specific actions.
 These techniques come from successful practice in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and deep learning approaches.
Thus GAP corresponds to full translation data augmentation scheme, but in practice such data augmentation creates unrealistic images (cf.
 However, this will often result in behaviors that optimize our reward function without actually satisfying our preferences (Russell, 2016; Everitt et al., 2017).
 Since the only overhead of the method at inference time is entropy encoding that can be implemented efficiently, the improvement is universal for any hardware implementation, being especially efficient on computationally optimized ones, where memory I/O dominates the energy footprint (Yang et al., 2017; Jouppi et al., 2017).
 These boundary points will guide a classifier to learn the correct decision boundary.
 We show that our proposed algorithm can easily be parallelized to enable more efficient imitation learning from MCTS.
We conduct various experiments, showing that HWR obtains better classification accuracy with the similar model size compared to the trained ternary quantization (TTQ, Zhu et al., 2016), which is a baseline ternarization method.
 By definition, causal relationships are invariant across input distributions (Peters et al., 2016), and hence make the predictions of causal models independent of the observed data distribution, let alone the observed dataset.
 Then in a comprehensive set of experiments on 1D and 2D regression and rendering tasks, we demonstrate ASNP’s performance gains over NP, ANP, SNP, GQN, and TGQN in different context regimes.
 Hence, we need to compress gt,k to reduce the communication cost.
Our reasoning then proceeds in two main steps:1.
There is also an active debate regarding the role of stochastic gradients in promoting generalization.
 The main contributions of this work include:
Our code, datasets and all experiment configuration files are available at http://bit.
In summary, we contribute:
 Our contributionsin detail are
 To this end, we take an informationtheoretic perspective on OoD detection, and propose to use the (expected) informativeness of an input x∗ / latent z∗ as a proxy for whether x∗ / z∗ is OoD or not.
 Specifically, our contributions are as follows:
 Although we study a more challenging setting where the data are non-i.i.d. and the neural network approximator has multiple layers, our convergence rate also matches the O(1/ √ T ) rate proved in Cai et al., (2019a) with i.i.d data and a two-layer neural network approximator.
 Note that while the MAP solution isa local minima for the training loss by definition, it may not necessarily be a local minima for the validation loss.
 But we find that our model-free, off-policy, autoencoder-based approach is able to match their performance, closing the gap between model-based and model-free approaches in image-based RL, despite being a far simpler method that does not require a world model.
 We show that the perturbation crafted through dilation has the effect of linearly approximating the ReLU layer responses for any data points.
 It allows using various models for the behavior of participants.
 To that end, we propose to refine some of the coarse labels resulting from task 1 using a semi-automatic segmentation method which requires additional manual intervention.
State-of-the-art extreme classifiers: Unfortunately, state-of-the-art extreme classifiers are either not scalable or inaccurate for queries and other short text documents.
 We show that this enables us to train very deep residual networks without normalization, and our method recovers most of the benefits of batch normalization when the batch size is not too large.
 Seasonality is defined as the tendency of a time-series to exhibit behavior that repeats itself every fixed period of time.
 While BiGAN (and BigBiGAN) are meant for learning useful highlevel representations of raw images, they still retain the generative modeling aspect of unsupervised learning by learning to jointly model an encoder and a generator using the generative adversarial loss.
 In summary, the contributions of this paper are the following:
 In summary, anomaly detection raises challenges in representability, scalability, multimodality, and time complexity.
 Furthermore, we demonstrate that our RL agent is capable of solving long-term sequential decision-making problems with sparse rewards faster.
 It has been shown (Gregor & LeCun, 2010; Sprechmann et al., 2015) that a d-layer LISTA network with trainable parameters Θ = {W(l),U(l), γ(l)}dl=1 achieves the same performance as the original ISTA but with much fewer iterations (i.g,, number of layers).
 In this way our semi-structured networks can reduce to existing networks as a special case.
 In this work, we use semi-supervised learning on all data at every active learning cycle, replacing supervised learning on labeled examples alone.
Additionally, the proposed attribute-aided evaluation methodology encourages us to introduce multiple attributes to find more potential factors which affect the NER models on different datasets.
 First, it is difficult to formulate the problem efficiently (Laporte & Mesa, 2015).
 Moreover, CVAEs alone do not guarantee distribution matching and suffers from the issue of over smoothing of the converted features.
 When evaluating our models, we sought to assess the unique contribution of the compositional embedding above and beyond what a “traditional” embedding could achieve.
Next, we hypothesize that the domain bias problem results from a situation in which the unseen domain overlaps that of the seen one in the shared space.
 This, in turn, allows one to infer the sensitivity of executing a computation graph to quantization effects.
 These approaches generalize standard (Euclidean) deep learning to domains such as general graphs and manifolds.
 STDP based SNN optimizes network parameters according to causality information with no labels (Moreno-Bote & Drugowitsch (2015); Lansdell & Kording (2019)).
 The displacement of the pixel is illustrated by a short arrow, which is within the small square.
 These constraints can include restricting the start location, stroke width, color, and other stroke parameters.
 This is done by maximizing the inner product of gradients computed on different minibatches with different class-imbalance rates.
Label preserving data augmentation, which increases the number of training samples in machine learning systems, is an effective solution to data insufficiency and is an efficient pre-processing step in computer vision (Wang & Perez (2017)).
 An example is depicted in Figures 1b (affect, depend) and 1d (update).
 (This should not be confused with weight quantization/sparsification, as studied by Wen et al., (2016); Hubara et al., (2016); Park et al., (2017); Wen et al., (2017), which we do not discuss here.
In the last year, significant theoretical clarity has been reached regarding the relationship between the GP prior and the distribution following gradient descent.
 In the simplest case, when the size of the subsets is limited to 1, each environment is given by the occurrence of a singular class label.
 In our work instead, we focus on the forward step, by investigating the effect of an orthogonal parameterization against an autoencoder-based solution.
 Representative approaches include DIFFPOOL (Ying et al., 2018b), GRAPH U-NET (Gao & Ji, 2019), and SAGPOOL (Lee et al., 2019).
 We implement an explicit selection method based on top-k selection.
 The approach we take in this work enables us to extend results from dense random networks to sparse ones.
 We call this problem \\u201cRecognition-Aware Image Processing\\u201d.
 We propose a model which can be used on different types of image sequences, physical or natural videos, and for a large variety of occlusion processes.
and tries to mimic the individual predictions of this ensemble member, as illustrated in Figure 1.
 In this paper, we consider Sokoban, a classic logical puzzle known for its combinatorial complexity and a recent benchmark for RL, ChainEnv, a seemingly impossible task also known as a ’hay in a needle-stack’ problem (see Osband et al., (2018)), and Toy Montezuma’s Revenge, environment notoriously known for its exploration difficulty (see Guo et al., (2019)).

The key contributions in this work are:
We highlight our main contributions as follows:
 Recent media reports have described ‘engagement’- (click or view-time) driven recommendation services such as YouTube contributing to viewer radicalization (Roose, 2019; Friedersorf, 2018).
 Thus, it is necessary and helpful to incorporate the sample interaction when conducting prediction.
 Observations with low prediction errors, or low intrinsic rewards, indicate that the agent has seen the observations plenty of times.
 The key component of wMAN is a multi-level co-attention mechanism that is encapsulated by a Frame-by-Word (FBW) interaction module as well as a Word-Conditioned Visual Graph (WCVG).
 Consistent with the results from the previous section, we find CPC to give state-of-the-art performance in this setting.
 We demonstrate that our method also produces more accurate energy estimations than that of MPNN, while being 30% slower at 0.
 The contribution of this paper is in two-folds:
 Our gradient estimator does not need to know the quality of the surrogate gradientsand always provides a descent direction that is more aligned with the true gradient than the surrogate gradient.
 The hierarchical nature of our approach, i.g,, a high-level policy generating the parameters of a lower-level policy, allows for generalization of the trained task to a variety of spatial, visual and contextual changes.
 We aim at tackling this problem with neural networks which are explainable and fully trainable.
 Our IDGL framework consisting of five parts: 1) a graph learning neural network to generate a graph topology; 2) a graph regularization neural network for controlling the smoothness, connectivity and sparsity of the generated graph; 3) a graph embedding neural network for generating node embeddings; 4) an iterative method to dynamically stop learning when the optimal graph is found; and 5) a prediction neural network for performing a downstream prediction task.
 The node split by the translated hyperplane is simple yet effective.
 For each audio processing operation (e.g, FFT) we create an abstract transformer which receives an abstraction representing an approximation of all possible inputs to the operation and outputs a new abstraction which approximates all possible outputs of the operation.
 We evaluate DBNN with semantic segmentation using road scene video sequences and the results show that DBNN has almost no degradation in computationalperformance compared to deep DNNs.
 We start from the known permutation symmetries and consider continuous low-loss paths that connect two equivalent global minima by merging the weight vectors of two neurons in a specific way.
 Unlike KD using the soft target, in our method, the output tensor from the teacher network is directly treated as the target of the collaboration network.
 This leads to suboptimal text representations and incoherent topics (e.g, topic Z4).
 A variety of conventional regularization techniques are considered, including L2/L1 weight regularization, dropout, weight clipping (Arjovsky et al., 2017) and Batch Normalization (BN) (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015).
 Thus, we could make full use of DCNN’s probability map and scribbles as input to our algorithms.
 Thus, DiVA is directly applicable toboth classification and class conditional sample generation with one integrated model.
The main contributions of our work can be summarized as follows.
1After creating NAPS (Zavershynskyi et al., 2018), a “Natural Programming Synthesis” dataset of programming contest problems with English descriptions and input-output examples, one of the authors later conceded that “ML, specifically natural language understanding, is not there yet.
 To mitigate this limitation, (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2018) have modified the regularization in Adam by decoupling weight decay regularization from the gradient-based update, and have achieved stateof-the-art results on large-scale language pre-training and downstream multi-task transfer learning objectives (Devlin et al., 2019).
 Besides, ROOTS provides the two-level hierarchy of the object-oriented representation: one for a global 3D scene and another for local 2D images.
 We propose Delayed Update to tolerate latency by putting off the synchronization barrier to a later iteration; we also propose Temporally Sparse Update to amortize the latency and alleviate congestion by reducing the synchronization frequency.
 We merely need to choose which algorithm to use when computing them.
 To this end, (Sonoda & Murata, 2019) propose a transport analysis method and state that a denoising Autoencoder transports mass to decrease the Shannon entropy of the data distribution.
 Model-based methods promise greater generalization abilities, but suffer from deterministic world models that are hard to learn and fail in stochastic environments.
 For example, in a citation network, node attributes are words, and documents of AI category usually contain words such as “learning”, “robotics”, “machine”, “neural”, etc.
 We start from an intuition that if a set of features are important to make a specific prediction, keeping them in the same values would preserve the prediction even though other irrelevant features are modified.
The key observation is that a valid 3D object should look realistic from multiple viewpoints.
Hendrycks et al., (2019) demonstrate that utilizing auxiliary datasets as OOD examples (as a supervised signal) significantly improves the performance of existing anomaly detection models on image and text data.
 The replay methods usually maintain an episodic memory of fixed-size with exemplars which are either directly replayed while learning e.g, in iCaRL (Rebuffi et al., (2017)) or indirectly utilized to adapt future gradient updates to the network e.g, inGEM (Lopez-Paz & Ranzaton (2017)) to avoid forgetting on previously seen tasks.
 These changes follow the standard population genetics equations for the weak selection regime, see Bürger (2000); Chastain et al., (2014); weak selection means that the classification task is only one of the many biological functions (digestion, locomotion, other brain circuits, etc.) that affect the animal’s fitness.
 From a more practical perspective, disentanglement can be a first step toward controlled generation/paraphrasing that considers only aspects of the structure, akin to the style-transfer works in computer vision, i.g,, rewriting a sentence while preserving its structural properties while ignoring its meaning, or vice-versa.
 In particular, they show that under certain over-parameterized condition, the neural network trained by gradient descent behaves similar to the kernel regression predictor using the neural tangent kernel (NTK) (Jacot et al., 2018).
 Recent works suggest that neural network learning behaves very differently in the underparameterized regime vs the overparameterized regime (Ma et al., 2018; Vaswani et al., 2019), characterized by whether the learnt model can achieve zero expected loss.
 Clearly, c∗ can be coded in K nats, and it can also be shown that zc∗ will be a low-bias sample from q(z |x).
 Let f(x) represent the mapping from the input to output of a deep network constructed using continuous, piecewise affine activations (e.g, ReLU, leaky ReLU, absolute value).
 Kernel-based reinforcementlearning (Ormoneit & Sen, 2002) uses locally weighted averaging to estimate the quality (value) of states.
The main contributions of this paper are:
 Existing methods that apply self-generated labels directly to boosting will fail as the noises in the labels will accumulate while boosting, especially when the noise rates are high - this is what we observed in our experiment results.
 Given this objective, it may be excessive to learn to perform full-state prediction, if aspects of the full state have no influence on the reward.
 Transferring adversarial text from stronger models (in terms of performances) to weaker ones is more successful; 4) Although BERT has achieved state-ofthe-art performances, we observe the performance drops are also larger than other standard models when confronted with adversarial examples, which indicates BERT is not robust under the adversarial settings; 5) Most human readers are not sensitive to our adversarial examples and can still answer the right answers when confronted with the adversary-injected paragraphs.
 Besides, we observe that previous methods used in IMGEP (Forestier et al., 2017) are inefficient to train the goal-conditioned exploration policy.
 Therefore, learning precise latent variables z = f(x) is critical to applications of VAE and GAN.
 This decomposition method reduces the space complexity from quadratic to linear.
 This makes the map dynamics slightly nonlinear, but no more so than that of single hidden layer networks under gradient descent.
 To further facilitate the feature synthesis of zero-shot codes, we take advantage of the hierarchical structure of the ICD codes and encourage the zero-shot codes to generate similar features with their nearest sibling code.
 Our contribution is three-fold:
 Using LARS, ResNet-50 can be trained on ImageNet in just a few minutes! However, it has been observed that its performance gains are not consistent across tasks.
 Correctly, we maintain the running average model, such as proposed by Tarvainen & Valpola (2017), a.k.a. the Mean-Teacher model.
 However, they neglect potential semantic relations between passage words and answer words, and thus fail to explicitly model the global interactions among them in the embedding space.
 Despite being an extension of previous works, we derive these results to justify our approach showing how the error propagation in AVI/API can theoretically benefit from learning multiple tasks jointly.
 Experiments show that our proposed STRUCTPOOL outperforms existing methods significantly and consistently.
 However existing embedding based graph matching methods (Wang et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019) are focused on the explicit modeling of node level features, whereby the edges are only used as topological node connection for message passing in GCN.
 For the between-node path reachability, we adopt the random walk algorithm to obtain the characteristics from a labeled reference node vi to a query unlabeled node vj in a given graph.
 Instead, the agent replays the demonstrations that were initially added to its buffer.
 The introduction of such soft softmax-triplet loss is also the key to the superior performance of our proposed framework.
 Information is transferred by sharing the same representation between labelled and unlabelled images, motivated by the fact that the new classes are often similar to the known ones.
 However, with a finite number of actionvalue functions, the average operation in these two algorithms will never completely remove the overestimation bias, as the average of several overestimation biases is always positive.
 Compared to baseline methods, we improve adaptation performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our devised model.
 Experiments on IWSLT14 German-English∗Work done during an internship at Facebook AI Research.
 However, such an approximation is close to `0 only when a approaches infinity, so the practical formulation of the transformed `1 (i.g, a = 1) is still not scale-invariant.
 We also show that training samplers without weight sharing in CNN space surpasses random sampling by a significant margin.
Our contributions are as follows:
 Other techniques to promote a SNN includes magnitude pruning and variational dropout, see Gale et al., (2019).
Our main contributions are threefold.
 We seek to use structural information characterizing how neighborhoods of a pair of nodes relate to each other.
 To train the confidence model, we utilize the mis-classified training samples during the training of the classification model.
 In this sense, the pairwise similarity is calculated in Euclidean feature space with cosine distance.
 The prototype-based relational graph not only captures the underlying relationship behind samples, but alleviates the potential effects of abnormal samples.
 On one hand, the estimate is in an intuitive form of an approximate contrastive free energy, which is expressed in terms of the expected energy and the (conditional) entropy of the corresponding variational distribution.
 However, for 4-bit and lower bitwidth, the integer accelerators cannot afford high bitwidth accumulators, which indicates higher silicon area and power cost.
 Given a dataset consisting of instances with unknown labels, our ultimate objective is to cluster the instances in this dataset.
 Moreover, since having a single set of shared parameters may not effectively utilize the varying degree of knowledge sharing structure among the tasks, we further cluster the task-adaptive parameters to obtain hierarchically shared parameters (See Figure 2).
We highlight the following contributions:
 The recent line of works using RL to solve CVRP shows the potential of machine learning algorithms.
In this paper, we propose a hierarchical-DRL-based agent, AutoQ, to automatically and rapidly search a QBN for each weight kernel and choose a QBN for each activation layer of a CNN for accurate kernel-wise network quantization.
 This is different from standard VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2013), whose prior of the latent variables can be a standard Gaussian distribution.
 In addition, we observe that the adversarial counterparts show similar shifts in the distributions of softmax as the clean images.
 Such distribution also exists in activations (Miyashita et al., 2016).
 We assume that consistent components x̂A, x̂B can reconstruct each other, i.g,x̂A can be reconstructed from x̂B; vice versa.
 CompositionNet, a second network, composites the projected K nearest neighbor images to a final output.
Yet, all existing results neglect the algorithmic effect during the training process in promoting adversarial robustness.
 For example, the phrase “There are three Democrats incumbents” requires both condition operation (where condition) and arithmetic operation (count).
On the point (4), a feature of ES algorithms is that exploration takes place in the parameter space.
 Finally, we expand NUTM application to linguistic problems by equipping NUTM with DNC core and achieve competitive performances against stateof-the-arts in the bAbI task (Weston et al., 2015).
 To address this challenge, we train a generative latent variable model over images from the robot’s environment and optimize over subgoals in the latent space of this model.
The contributions of this paper are three-fold.
 We present three considerations when constructing attention-induced subgraphs: (1) given a subgraph, we first attend within it to select a few nodes and then attend over those nodes’ neighborhood for next expansion; (2) we propagate attention across steps to capture long-term dependency; (3) our attention mechanism models reasoning process explicitly through pipeline disentangled from underlying representation computing.
 Contrastive loss (Sun et al., 2014) and triplet loss (Schroff et al., 2015) are two classical objectives for this purpose, but the training iterations will dramatically grow to construct image pairs or triplets, which results in slow convergence and instability.
 In this sense, we may say that a state is relatively unreachable from another state if an arrow of time assigns a lower value to the former.
This paper addresses the second challenge by investigating the root causes of selection bias, by dissecting and identifying the underlying factors that can generate an observational dataset D, and leveraging this knowledge to reduce, as well as account for, the negative impact of selection bias on estimating the treatment effects from D.
 This can be explained by Brenier’s polar factorization theorem Brenier (1991b; 1987; 1991a) and Figalli’s regularity theorem Figalli (2010); Chen & Figalli (2017) (Thm. 5 in Appendix B), which asserts that if the support of the target distribution is not convex, then there will be singularity sets on the support of the source distribution, such that the transport map is discontinuous on these sets.
 In our variant of the BoxWorld environment, bridge BoxWorld, the agent must use two keys simultaneously to obtain the Gem; this structure in the environment creates many 3-way relationships between entities, including for example the relationship between the locked boxes j, k providing the two keys and the Gem entity i.
 We evaluate our algorithm and several prior methods on a challenging, vision-based control problem involving manipulation tasks from four distinct families of tasks: button-pressing, grasping, pushing, and pick and place.
 Significant progress has been made in leveraging unlabeled samples by enforcing the model to producelow entropy predictions on unlabeled data (Grandvalet & Bengio, 2004) or consistent predictions on perturbed input (Laine & Aila, 2017; Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017; Miyato et al., 2019).
 Most adversarial training variants neglect this distinction, where all training examples are treated equally in both the maximization and the minimization processes, regardless of whether or not they are correctly classified.
 Apart from the GAN part, the training of the neural network adds little additional computation overhead and requires no extra denotations.
 We proceed to analyze theoretical convergence properties of MaSS in the interpolated regime.
1Our second finding is about the deeper layers of the network.
 Second, we explore whether it is more beneficial to incorporate the limited amount of labels available into training and thoroughly test the benefits and trade-offs of this approach compared to supervised validation.
In the above, ‘general’ networks is a class of networks meant to exclude degenerate cases.
 To avoid interfering with existing knowledge, the newly added hidden states are not fed back to the previously trained states.
 The approach trains a “setter” model to generate goals for a “solver” agent by optimizing three setter objectives: discovering the subset of expressible goals that are valid, or achievable by an expert solver (goal validity), encouraging exploration in the space of goals (goal coverage), and maintaining goal feasibility given the agent’s current skill (goal feasibility).
In Section 5 we further investigate the contribution of all input tokens in the generation of the contextual embeddings in order to quantify the mixing of token and context information.
 Random search in action space, as what is being done in state-of-the-art MBRL algorithms such as PETS, is insufficient for more complex environments.
In summary, our main contributions are:
 Top: fifty is seen during meta-training; prototypical network (Snell et al., 2017) finds important words.
 (1)Obtaining a second order guarantee has emerged as a desired goal in the nonconvex optimization community.
 E-mail: gleave@berkeley.
 We use four previously published datasets for open-domain QA and observe that questions in these datasets often concern entities.
 With thorough experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that our method works on both small academical datasets and industry-scale machine learning tasks.
We call our approach neural code fusion (NCF).
 The key concept is to consider the distribution of the unseen data as the difference between two distributions that are relatively easy to obtain.
 The PL condition (or its equivalent condition) has been proved for a class of linear and non-linear neural networks (Hardt & Ma, 2016; Charles & Papailiopoulos, 2017; Zhou & Liang, 2017).
 Instead of adversarial training, we propose to learn robust models by directly taking the certified radius into the objective.
Among all these attacks, we find CapsNets perform the best in detecting adversarial examples.
 While defense mechanisms based on ordinary adversarial training are vulnerable to rubbish examples, inputs that cause confident predictions of our models have humanunderstandable semantic meanings.
 The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly enhance the topological similarity (Brighton & Kirby, 2006) between the emergent language and the original meaning space in a simple referential game (Lewis, 1969).
 Unlike noise-like perturbations, such perturbations would have much higher transferablity across different models.
 The initial image set for MAD to explore can be made arbitrarily large provided that the cost of computational prediction for all competing classifiers is cheap.
 Instead, the measure of sample efficiency we adopt is the so-called sample complexity of exploration (Kakade et al., 2003), which is also a widely-accepted definition.
Learning a dictionary in a deep neural network requires to implement a sparse `1 code.
 Thus, we can theoretically derive the trade-off between the compression rate and the approximation error of any layer in the neural network.
A better policy is, for instance, given by the stale synchronous parallel (SSP) policy Ho et al., (2013); Dai et al., (2015), which can be considered as a trade off between BSP and ASP.
 OpenAI designed network structures to address multiagent learning problems in a famous Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA), Dota2.
 Similarly, the hand-held object is extracted using the semantic segmentation method of Zhou et al., (2019), which incorporates elements from Maninis et al., (2018); Law & Deng (2018).
 The certified radius for top-1 predictions derived by Cohen et al., (2019) is a special case of our certified radius when k = 1.
 An agent whose Q-value estimates have been zero-initialised must at the first time step select an action randomly.
 In it, each element is either of a word from the input sentence, or a region-of-interest (RoI) from the input image, together with certain special elements to disambiguate different input formats.
 This problem — referred to as Ensemble Distribution Distillation (EnD2) — yields a method that preserves both the distributional information and improved classification performance of an ensemble within a single neural network model.
 This method was later embraced by other works (Jiang et al., 2017; Hardy et al., 2017; Giladi et al., 2019) and is currently the common method for penalizing stale gradients.
 InfoGANs.
 Our models fit the data in R2 (middle).
 This new architectural component leads to radically simpler architectures for neural semantic parsing from denotations—architectures based on a single end-to-end differentiable process, rather than cascades of retrieval and neural processes.
 These properties allow CLNs to represent any quantifier-free SMT formula operating on mixed integer-real arithmetic as an end-to-end differentiable series of operations.
 In this paper, we introduce a novel, conditionally reversible video prediction model, CrevNet, in the sense that when conditioned on previous hidden states, it can exactly reconstruct the input from its predictions.
 In order to fully assess the logical reasoning ability of the models, we propose to identify the biased data points and group them as EASY set, and put the rest into HARD set.
 AssembleNet models use equivalent number of parameters to standard two-stream (2+1)D ResNet models.
 Based on these observations, we make the following contributions:
 We investigate how to substitute this noise injection mechanism with other regularization schemes in the proposed deterministic Regularized Autoencoders (RAEs), and we thoroughly analyze how this affects performance.
 In stage level, we search for the best strategy to distribute the computation among different resolution.
Our contributions are:
 More in detail, we performed a large number of experiments within a rigorous model selection and assessment framework, in which all models were compared using the same features and the same data splits.
 In contrast with earlier bounds for settings like the one considered here, our bounds are in terms of a sum over layers of the distance from initialization of the layer.
Furthermore, under a special configuration of heperparameters, the proposed algorithm reduces to the SC-RMSprop (Mukkamala & Hein, 2017), which is a variant of RMSprop algorithm for strongly convex functions.
 The overall loss function is a sum of the cross-entropy losses associated with Csup and CGAT .
 Many existing IRL methods need to solve a sequence of computationally expensive reinforcement learning problems, due to their bi-level optimization nature.
 Such adversarial examples can be used to easily bypass authentication/verification systems without having a true sample of the target class.
We pre-train the language model, the context processor, and the context encoder with a clean version of Reddit data (Dziri et al., 2018), pre-train the knowledge encoder using a Wikipedia dump available on ParlAI, and compare our model with baselines that hold state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks including the Wizard of Wikipedia (Wizard) (Dinan et al., 2019) and CMU Document Grounded Conversations (CMU DoG) (Zhou et al., 2018b).
Our contributions are threefold.
 In detail, based on the Nash certainty equivalence (NCE) principle (Huang et al., 2006; 2007), we propose a mean-field actor-critic algorithm which, at each iteration, given the mean-field state µ, approximately attains the optimal policy π∗µ of each agent, and then updates the mean-field state µ assuming that all the agents follow π∗µ.
 They are memory efficient as only one bit per weight must be stored and are computationally efficient as all activations are binary, which enables the use of specialized algorithms for fast binary matrix multiplication.
 We call networks that have been trained using this criterion generative ratio matching (GRAM) networks, or GRAM-nets2.
 Then, we conduct experiments to empirically verify our theoretical results across various settings.
 Both works leverage an analysis-by-synthesis approach through the machinery of VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014) to train these models without labelled supervision, e.g, in the form of ground truth segmentation masks.
 Based on the above parameters non-uniqueness property, we introduce into a deep network stochastic convolutional layers, where filters are sampled from learned filter spaces.
 From our experiments, it is possible to shift the distribution of generated images to some degree, but we cannot extrapolate entirely out of the dataset’s support.
 We aim at learning a policy from the data that finds the most informative regions on a set of unlabeled images and asks for its labels, such that a segmentation network can achieve high-quality performance with a minimum number of labeled pixels.
 Bhagoji et al., (2017) reduce the dimensions of the feature space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and random feature grouping, before estimating gradients.
 Our main contributions are the following:
Given a limited budget, one obvious strategy might be data subsampling (Bachem et al., 2017; Sener & Savarese, 2018).
 This indicates that sparsity alone is not sufficient to ensure maximal speedup; the distribution of the non-zero values plays a significant role as well.
 The main difference between VRTD and batch TD is that VRTD applies the variance reduction directly to TD learning rather than to a transformed optimization problem in batch TD.
 Rather, gradients of the minimum divergence objective with respect to behavior policy may be computed directly.
 Finally, we assess our models using human evaluations.
 The performance of mode connectivity is significantly better than several baselines including fine-tuning, training from scratch, pruning, and random weight perturbations.
 It also allows us to use the framework of Khodak et al., (2019a) to provide a DP GBML algorithm that enjoys provable learning guarantees in convex settings.
The main contributions of this work are:
 The first type is classic information retrieval (IR) algorithms relying on token-based matching.
 Our method can accomplish new tasks specified as complex goals without having seen an expert complete these tasks before.
We evaluate our method on challenging multi-goal multi-agent environments with high-dimensional state spaces: cooperative navigation with difficult formations, double lane merges in the SUMO simulator (Lopez et al., 2018), and strategic teamwork in a Checkers game.
 It is unclear what priors are being learned by the models, and how they are affected by the choice of architecture and training strategies.
 For example, consider a doctor who uses prediction tools to help perform diagnosis.
 Compared to the baseline CNN counterparts, PG obtains 3.5% and 0.6% higher classification accuracy with up to 4.5× and 2.4× less computational cost for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, respectively.
We experiment on 21,800 questions from the recently proposed DROP dataset (Dua et al., 2019) that are heuristically chosen based on their first n-gram such that they are covered by our designed modules.
 It is worth mentioning that this is not the first work on the transferability of neural architecture.
We provide an implementation of GraN-DAG here.
 Consider a training set with two examples a and b.
 The EMN and other similar models (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Santoro et al., 2017; Pavez et al., 2018) have used fixed memory representations based on combining word embeddings with a positional encoding transformation.
 We first reconstruct dialogue state as a sequence of concatenated slot values.
 The state vector as well as the discrete samples evolve close to the equilibrium state, i.g,, g(t) ≈ φ(Ug(t) +Wx(t) + b) under general conditions (Sec.3).
 The total regret of all agents is used as the performance criterion of a communication protocol.
 Using biophysical model of a cortical network Gonzalez et al., (2019) and Wei et al., (2018) showed that sleep dynamics promotes reactivation and helps to create distinct representations for unique memories by devoting synapses to specific memory traces.
 We prove that under certain conditions on the input and output linear transformations, GD and SGD can converge to the global minimum of the training loss function.
 This amortized inference (Gershman & Goodman, 2014) approach leads to fast inference once the model is fully trained.
 When only predicting library types, LAMBDANET has a top1 accuracy of 75.6%, achieving a significant improvement over DeepTyper (61.5%).
Each step will be described in greater detail in Section 3.
We have the following contributions over prior works:
 We also compare to recent, carefully designed and more complex models, including approaches using memory (e.g, OLTR (Liu et al., 2019)) as well as more sophisticated losses (Cui et al., 2019).
 Our main contributions are as follows:
1).
From the learning perspective, the 0-1 loss is more robust to outliers compared with an unbounded (convex) loss (e.g, hinge loss) (Masnadi-Shirazi & Vasconcelos, 2009).
 While feedback alignment algorithms work well on small and medium-sized benchmarks, a recent study identified that they are unable to provide learning on more challenging datasets like ImageNet (Bartunov et al., 2018).
 In contrast, our method consists of physics-aware modules allowing efficiently leveraging the inductive bias to learn spatiotemporal data from the physics system.
 Another common way for variance reduction is adding appropriate baselines (Owen, 2013; Williams, 1992; Paisley et al., 2012; Ranganath et al., 2014; Mnih & Gregor, 2014), and there exist several such methods customized for discrete variables (Tucker et al., 2017; Grathwohl et al., 2018).
Nevertheless, empirically, not even this stationarity is satisfied by GANs, which are known to frequently destabilize and diverge during training.
 Different from the related, and similar, Bellman operator that goes forward in time, this operator is backward in time.
 Being a simple normalization step between layers, PAIRNORM is not specific to any particular GNN but rather applies broadly.
 First, distance to initialization has been observed to be very related to generalization in deep learning (Neyshabur et al., 2019; Nagarajan and Kolter, 2019), so regularizing by distance to initialization can potentially help generalization.
 Our method has the advantage of not requiring a labeled dataset nor a model with an encoder.
 Consider the Lagrangian formulation of the constrained optimization problem given in equation 2.
 They do not require people to wear sensors on their bodies, can operate through walls, and track people’s locations in different rooms.
 In this paper, we build on this perspective and identify concrete regimes in which neural net learning is coupled with higher-order f (k)’s rather than its linearization.
 In a NFSP model, the neural strategies are updated by selecting the best responses to their opponents’ average strategies.
 As an example, the input specification I shown in Figure 1 contains a single example with absolute view positions for a Nexus 4 device and the InferUI synthesizer easily finds multiple programs that satisfy it (dashed box).
 Again, our method converges in a third of the iterations required by backpropagation thourgh a solver and each iteration is 50x faster than the fastest explicit scheme.
 We describe the details of the proposed learning algorithm and experimental results in the following sections.
 We conducted extensive hyperparameter search for fine-tuning on various transfer learning benchmarks with different source models.
 In computer vision, Plug & Play Generative Networks (PPGN) from Nguyen et al., (2017) developed a mechanism for generating images with different attributes by plugging a discriminator (attribute model) p(a|x) together with a base generative model p(x) and sampling from the resulting p(x|a) ∝ p(a|x)p(x), effectively creating a conditional generative model on the fly from any supplied attribute model.
 We propose RGBD Generative Adversarial Networks (RGBDGAN), which learns to generate RGBD images from natural RGB image datasets without the need of any annotations, such as camera pose and depth annotations, multiple viewpoints for the single objects.
To summarise, the main contributions of this paper are
 The rare classes in ImageNet-21k form a natural benchmark for few-shot learning.
 We also obtain the first, to the best of our knowledge, certifiably robust model for an audio classification task, Librispeech (Panayotov et al., 2015), with variable-length inputs.
 We find that this results in better performance on several knowledge transfer tasks.
 The first stage selects a sub-expression that can be simplified and the second stage simplifies the sub-expression.
The contributions can be summarized as follows:
 To handle this problem, we propose to learn an inputdependent stochastic noise; that is, we want to learn distribution of noise, or perturbation, that is meaningful for a given training instance.
 These methods map the training data to a transformed space in which the dependencies between the class label and the sensitive attributes are removed Edwards & Storkey (2015); Hardt et al., (2016); Xu et al., (2018); Sattigeri et al., (2018); Raff & Sylvester (2018); Madras et al., (2018); Zemel et al., (2013); Louizos et al., (2015).
 Then we can deduce that T cells from dataset X should be at least mapped to T cells from dataset Y .
 A single minibatch is then pushed through each candidate network to calculate its Fisher potential: the sum of the total (empirical) Fisher information for each of its blocks.
 We further selected a variety of empirical measures such as sharpness (Keskar et al., 2016), Fisher-Rao norm (Liang et al., 2017) and path norms (Neyshabur et al., 2017).
 Second, dot products, softmax, and weighted summation in self-attention layers involve multiplication or division of two variables both under perturbation, namely cross-nonlinearity, which is not present in feed-forward networks.
 DeepSets and PointNetSeg are universal.
 Two main scenarios of particular interest can be decoupled as follows:Scenario 1.
 We illustrate the CycleGAN model in fig. 1.
 In the experiments, we show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art models on not only style transfer but also object transfiguration.
 In this case, we adopt a continuous relaxation of top-K sampling to guarantee differentiability (Plötz & Roth, 2018).
 System log anomaly detection is an important topic in computer security.
 In addition, both Mirhoseini et al., (2017; 2018) and Addanki et al., (2019) consider only placement decisions and rely on TensorFlow’s dynamic scheduler; they do not address the static compiler setting where it is natural to jointly optimize scheduling and placement.
 The global policy consumes this free-space map with agent pose and employs learning to exploit structural regularities in layout of real world environments to produce long-term goals.
 They have been widely explored as an approach to reduce the high computational and memory demands of DNNs.
Our study of the model architecture addresses the importance of (i) the network depth, (ii) the number of attention heads, and (iii) the total number of model parameters in B-BERT.
 Furthermore, by fully parallelizing the foreground object processing, we resolve the scalability issue of existing spatial attention methods.
 This is the reason why only recently this problem was tackled by constructing two independent representations for each node (source and target representations) 39; 59; 27.
 The main term, O ( 1/ √ nT ) , matches with the centralized baselines with exact communication and shows a linear speedup in the number of workers n.
 Experimental results show that our proposed modelbased attack can successfully degrade agent performance and is also more effective and efficient than model-free attacks baselines.
 The programs are represented in a domain-specific language (DSL) which includes sophisticated building blocks including neural networks complete with gradient-descent mechanisms, learned objective functions, ensembles, buffers, and other regressors.
 In one of our tasks the agent is able to discover and exploit a bug in the environment in spite of all the demonstrators completing the task in the intended way.
 Roughly speaking, they construct the variational posterior as a function of the labeled set dlt without taking advantage of the unlabeled set xt.
 We begin by carefully analyzing the information contained in the class and content representations.
 We show that our DyNA PPO method achieves higher cumulative reward for a given budget (measured in terms of number of calls to f(x)) than existing methods, such as standard PPO, various forms of the cross-entropy method, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary search.
 Intuitively, the agent can efficiently solve the task by leveraging the inductive bias of underlying task structure (Section 2.2).
 Note that this is a natural extension of the reconstruction to the hidden space.
 The defining characteristic distinguishing our method from others is that the spatial interactions among the Lagrangian particles can evolve temporally via advection in a learned flow field, like their fluidic counterpart in a physical circumstance.
We make the following major contributions:
 Specifically:
 Specifically, we start from an initial large supernet and rewrite every convolution - channel-wise operation - convolution structure of it in the form the weighted sum of atomic blocks; the weights reflect the contribution of the atomic blocks to the network capacity and are called importance factors.
 However, the tractable density for the approximate distribution is required due to variational approximation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Lite Transformer model offers significant improvements over the transformer on three language tasks: machine translation, abstractive summarization, and language modeling.
 This characterization is rigorous for odd dimensions d and for functions where the above expressions are classically welldefined (i.g,, smooth enough such that all derivatives are finite, and the integrand in the Radon transform is integrable).
 It requires optimizing over two objectives.
 A state-based β-VAE (Higgins et al., 2017) is learned as the prior for the next state to visit.
 What lies in the heart of our algorithm is to learn a function to assess whether two parts should be grouped.
 For instance, in one of our case studies, when the road is recolored from gray to blue, the image gets misclassified to tench (a fish) although a car remains evidently visible (fig.  2b).
 Therefore, we propose a simple regularizer to the discriminator of GAN: we augment images with semantic-preserving augmentations before they are fed into the GAN discriminator and penalize the sensitivity of the discriminator to those augmentations.
 The main constructions are based on Fourier transforms.
 Thus, a temporal generative model that can deal with dynamic backgrounds along with many foreground objects is an important step toward natural video scene understanding.
 By introducing controlled perturbations to predictions, our approach targets poisoning the training objective (see fig. 2).
 We will make our code publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.
 Based on these studies, we draw the following conclusions:• The human visual system does not perform (fully) equivariant feature transformations to visual data.
 Their experiments show that a DNN with a learned and heterogeneous bitwidth assignment outperforms quantized DNNs with a homogeneous bitwidth assignment.
 Negative sampling is typically described as a softmax approximation; however, only uniform negative sampling correctly approximates the softmax.
 To obtain the uncertainty estimates,Affiliations: 1.
 This notion of Fisher-Rao norm is motivated by information geometry and has good invariance properties.
 As a result, even though the VMs are running on separate processor cores, the attacker can monitor the cache accesses a DL framework—PyTorch or TensorFlow—makes while the victim system is running (Liu et al., 2015).
In this work, we propose a hybrid training technique which combines ANN-SNN conversion and spike-based backpropagation that reduces the overall latency as well as decreases the training effort for convergence.
 The second encourages the attention heads to maintain similar positions, preventing the latency from being dominated by a single or a few heads.
 The source domain could be vastly larger than the target, giving importance to weights that are irrelevant to the target task.
 First and foremost, we know from prior arts (Chen et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019) that LISTA tends to learn large enough biases to achieve no “false positive” in the support of generated codes and further ensure linear convergence, and we prove that this tendency, however, also makes the magnitude of the code components being lower than that of the ground-truth.
We can interpret our theorem as the generalization of the well-known property that if a finite and discrete Markov process is irreducible and aperiodic, it exponentially converges to a unique equilibrium and the eigenvalues of its transition matrix determine the convergence rate (see, e.g, Chung & Graham (1997)).
Unsupervised learning of latent representations is also an important problem in other domains, such as image generation Kingma & Welling (2013); Kim & Mnih (2018) and natural language processing Mikolov et al., (2013a).
Motivated by the above observations, in this paper, we propose the Skip Gradient Method (SGM) to generate adversarial examples using gradients more from the skip connections rather than the residual modules.
 As shown in Figure 1(c), our key observation is that the distributions of the image features extracted from the tasks in different domains are significantly different.
 Also, there have been various efforts toward making the idea of neural resource allocation scalable, the progress and compress work Schwarz et al., (2018), and the incremental moment matching Lee et al., (2017) work fall under this category.
 Our key contributions are summarized as follows:
 The authors and industry evidence suggest that this is due to the fact that class-based systems are relatively easy to implement, but also because DoS is not known in advance.
 For example, if one proves that two GNN architectures are captured with two logics, then one can immediately transfer all the knowledge about the relationships between those logics, such as equivalence or incomparability of expressiveness, to the GNN setting.
 That said, classical probabilistic models for unsupervised sequence transduction (e.g, the HMM or semi-HMM) typically enforce overly strong independence assumptions about data to make exact inference tractable (Knight et al., 2006; Ravi & Knight, 2011; Pourdamghani & Knight, 2017).
 These evolutionary arms races create implicit autocurricula (Leibo et al., 2019a) whereby competing agents continually create new tasks for each other.
 The size of the search space is related to the number of nodes defined for the DAG and the size of the operation set.
 For example, it misfires on I would highly recommend this phone if it weren’t for their poor service.
 Our paper’s main contributions are:
 Through these explicit and implicit regularizations, deep learning tends to produce a simpler model than its full expression ability (Valle-Perez et al., 2019; Verma et al., 2018).
We tackle these questions from the perspective of dynamical stability.
 In addition, the forward and backward models share parameters, saving the effort of learning separate models for each direction.
 In other words, the representation of linear maps as products of sparse matrices tightly captures all forms of structure.
Our contribution can be summarized as follow:
 In other words, only messages from nearby nodes are aggregated.
There have been much efforts developing convergence guarantees for FL algorithm based on the assumptions that (1) the data are iid and (2) all the devices are active.
 However, these incorrect training predictions may be quite diverse and letting the model be aware of which incorrect predictions are more incorrect or less incorrect than others may more effectively guide model training.
 Random selection is generally inefficient as the distribution of the best branching decision is rarely uniform.
 We show that∗Equal contribution.
 In doing so, we demonstrate that the algorithmic changes imposed by such optimizations make rigorous comparisons of algorithms difficult.
To summarize, our contribution in this work is threefold:
 To predict RNA structures with pseudoknots, energy-based methods need to run more computationally intensive algorithms to decode the structures.
 Sample efficiency is important to enable the later use of such discovery algorithms for physical systems (Grizou et al., 2020), where experimental time and costs are strongly bounded.
We evaluate against ten different baselines.
 This is so that capsules are activated only when their component-capsules are in the right spatial relationship to form an instance of the object-type it represents.
 Our key contributions can be summarized as follows.
 An interesting item for future work would be to explore instantiations of the method with other convex relaxations than the one considered here.
 Third, we eliminate the assumption of expensive expert demonstrations with the cost of adding a relatively economical sparse reward in the end.
 Further, all results in this paper can be easily extended to cases where the number of Fi and the number of Gj are different.
 To that end, our contributions are three-fold.
The model bears a certain structural resemblance with Bayesian occupancy grids (BOG), which have been used in mobile robotics for many years Moravec (1988); Rummelhard et al., (2015).
 Finally, in step (iii.), we propose a learning algorithm whereby we leverage the rich semantics of the inputs and the perturbations as a source of knowledge upon which we impose adversarial constraints to produce adversarial examples.
 It is a common practice to focus on harder instances when training DNNs (Shrivastava et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017).
 Nonetheless, another study by Perez & Wang (2017) analyzed the performance of different techniques for object recognition and concluded that one of the most successful techniques so far is still the traditional data augmentation carried out in most studies.
 Building upon the harmonic analysis of existing gradient estimators, we present an algorithm, FouST, that admits low bias gradient estimates for Boolean latent variable models.
We propose \\u03b2-Similarity to record the results in X-Forest into a similarity matrix.
 We address this fundamental challenge by proposing a novel Reinforcement Learning-based method to fit Locally Interpretable Models which we call RL-LIM.
 Our method integrates data valuation with the training of the target task predictor model.
 Figure 1 presents two residual architectures with a interval of 1 and 2 respectively.
 However, adversarial training needs to find a δi for each (xi, yi), thus the dimension of the overall search space for all data is substantial, which makes the computation expensive.
Our proposed deep audio prior framework has the following main contributions:
 Then by broadcasting class prototypes to each instance according to its probability prediction, the inaccurate semantic distribution depicted by instance predictions can be alleviated.
 Context states are the states of the environment excluding the states of interest.
 We also discuss how depth-induced momentum is different than explicit momentum.
 While this may seem to be too restrictive, we later show that improving the robustness of networks against Gaussian attacks also improves the robustness against a family of other types of attacks.
Closer to our work, there has been several prior arts that propose to perform verification differently.
 For example, Zhou et al., (2015) assessed the selectivity of units in the pool5 layer of two CNNs trained to classify images into 1000 objects and 205 scene categories, respectively.
 The mechanism of DVS can be outlined as a simulation of the visual path structures and functionalities of the biological visual systems whose neurons asynchronously communicate and encode the visual information from environment as spatiotemporally sparse light intensity change in the form of spikes.
For regression training, a group of papers studied the trajectory of the networks’ predictions and showed that they evolve via a “neural tangent kernel” (NTK) as introduced by Jacot et al., 21.
 By putting most attention on the pair of embeddings with smallest difference, dual representation of nodes with less deviation will be generated, which can be visualized as zv|· in Figure 1.
 This generalization enables a precise understanding of the relationship between depthwise separable convolution and standard convolution.
• RWS.
 Basically, we aim to apply DRL to prune CNNs by maximizing received rewards, which are designed to satisfy the overall budget constraints along side with network’s training accuracy.
 The global convergence of ADMM on deep learning has rarely been explored (Wang et al., (2019); Zeng et al., (2019)).
 Our evaluation method is FID Heusel et al., (2017) and FVD Unterthiner et al., (2018) as it is a common metric being used for image and video generation schemes.
 PUGAN generates low sampling rate audio using the first few layers of the original WaveGAN (referred to as the lightweight WaveGAN module).
 ProtoAttend is model-agnostic and can even be integrated with pre-trained models.
 Our findings suggest that in the most of the data sets there are isomorphic graphs and their proportion varies from as much as 100% to 0%.
 They attribute the effect of an initiallylarge learning rate to escaping spurious local minima or accelerating training and attribute the effect of decaying the learning rate to avoiding oscillation around local minima.
What’s more, Arpit et al., (2017); Rahaman et al., (2018); Xu et al., (2019) observed that "Dark knowledge" represents the discrepancy of convergence speed of different types of information during the training of the neural network.
 Methods based on Vecchia’s approximation (Vecchia, 1988; Datta et al., 2016; Liu & Liu, 2019; Finley et al., 2019) decompose the joint probability of data points into conditionals according to a data ordering and then neglect far data points that are conditioned on.
 We use an unsupervised loss, the cycle consistency loss, to train the network.
 We notice that, during training, our approach can make the feature distributions to be similar with fewer epochs.
 This is lower than existing results for solving problem (1).
 In such a case, the model may allocate small attention values for the feature; that is, the attention will be attenuated based on the uncertainty.
 In this paper, we show that the gradients are wellbehaved without any exploding or vanishing at initialization for the Pre-LN Transformer both theoretically and empirically.
 Our analysis shows that AII maximizes the variational upper bound of the conditional entropy H(a|z), and AII objective itself is not upperbounded.

 Our LNSM robustly predicts the ground truth distances, while the L2 metric labels plume (b) as more similar.
 That the x-coordinate of a point is positive implies that the attachment of GWM improved the train performance for the corresponding model-dataset pair.
 Our method is simple and only adds a fully-connected layer to perform localization.
 We use Yk to denote the sequence of observations up to time instant k, i.g,, Yk := {y1, · · · , yk}.
 Therefore, the method above is not appropriate to be applied to recognize images from real scenes.
 We studied multiple initializers of new layers and multiple growing policies, and surprisingly find that: (1) a random initializer works equally or better than complicated Network Morphism; (2) it is more effective to grow before a shallow net converges.
 Consequently, expensive computational resources would be wasted if all instances are treated equally.
 Therefore, the proposed MEGA algorithm allows deep neural networks to learn new tasks while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.
In this paper, we have the following contributions,
 We introduce new algorithm design and mathematical techniques to obtain the first general ST -equivariant CNN in literature with both computational efficiency and proved representation stability.

The aim of this paper is to introduce a hierarchical Latent Spatial-Temporal Origin-Destination (LSTOD) prediction model to jointly extract the complex spatial-temporal features of OD data by using some well-designed CNN-based architectures.
 Further analysis of the learned dropout probability for each unit reveals that our input-adaptive variational dropout approach generates a clearly distinguishable dropout mask for each task, thus enables each task to utilize different sets of neurons for their specialization.
 Furthermore, to accelerate the computation of Euclidean distance, We expand the samples and the centroids into two tensors of the same shape, and then accelerate with the high performance parallel computing of GPU.
 We detail our problem setup and derive a generalization bound for meta-learning in Section 2.
 Based on our observations, we develop QGAN, a novel quantization method based on ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithm, and a novel multi-precision quantization algorithm.
In fact, the training process of GANs is sample-dependent.
 Finally, collecting human-provided rationales at scale is expensive and thus impractical.
 Compared with the CNN models (He et al., (2016); Huang et al., (2017)) of computer vision (CV), the CNN models of text classification are very shallow.
 Although it can be proved that the generator and discriminator can converge to the local Nash equilibrium under some strong assumptions (Martin et al., 2017), many GAN algorithms can not converge globally (Gemp & Mahadeven, 2019).
In this work, we propose a model for tracking disease progression that includes the effects of treatments.
 When a network chooses an action, this feedback signal is most pronounced for those neurons and synapses that can be held responsible for the selection of this action and hence for the resulting RPE.
 If we plan for k steps and then resort to some Q-function for estimating the total reward of the remaining steps, we can obtain a policy with 2k more pieces than what Q-function has.
 We propose a pretraining approach for style encoders, in multi-modal I2I translation networks, which makes the training simpler and faster by requiring fewer losses/constraints.
 It also leads to a better selection of the relevant features, and consequently to the improvement of the generated captions.
Direct algorithms solve the forward and inverse problem PDEs by directly approximating the solution with a deep neural network.
 To summarize, we force the perturbation to be within a certain proportion of the original audio waveform at all positions based on iterative proportional clipping, to both restrict the perceptible noise and preserve the TD.
 To generalize well, we want the optimizer to land in wide minimas.
confidence probability 1 − δ, our analysis shows that the estimate ẑv of the exact embedding zv of a node v such that Pr‖ẑv − zv‖2 ≥ ε ≤ δ and the estimate ∂̂zv∂θ of the exact gradient ∂zv ∂θ ofthe embedding zv with respect to the network parameters θ, such that Pr‖ ∂̂zv∂θ − ∂zv ∂θ ‖F ≥ ε ≤ δ can be computed in a constant time.
 Further more, it treats arm reward naturally with m-way dimension interaction by m-dimensional joint distribution.

 However, to our knowledge, in benchmark image classification tasks, NODEs are significantly inferior to state-of-the-art discrete-layer models (error rate: 19% for NODE vs 7% for ResNet18 on CIFAR10) (Dupont et al., 2019; Gholami et al., 2019).
We next study the advantage of having multiple heads in the attention layer.
 In Section 2.3 we show that by performing multiple passes of parallel prediction and mixing, we obtain a conditioning sequence that converges to a sample decode from the model.
 On the other hand, on tasks where traditionally SGD outperforms Adam (ImageNet training), we show that the noise is well concentrated.
 Additionally, there are more complex classes of compounds where the 3-D structure is integral to the molecule’s properties.
 However, it is ignored in existing KD methods of BERT, such as Distilled BiLSTMSOFT (Tang et al., 2019), BERT-PKD (Sun et al., 2019) and DistilBERT2.
 The majority of popular NAS algorithms are deployed over a directed acyclic graph (DAG) search space – the set of possible architectures is comprised of the set of all DAGs of a certain size, together with all possible combinations of operations on each node (Zoph & Le, 2017; Pham et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018b; Ying et al., 2019).
 We do that by combining VAE and GAN approaches thus enjoying the best of both worlds.
 We carefully study this method, and make the surprising novel observation that in order to produce high quality samples, it is necessary to significantly increase the weight on the reconstruction loss.
 Here content refers to the characteristic of state at each time step, e.g, moving speed, direction, and general gesture of upper body, while style refers to the long-range motion pattern which keeps relative constant across whole subsequence.
 Because a larger receptive field can learn the relationships between different objects, even if there are problems, such as conclusion or inconsistent illumination, the network can use the context information to infer disparity and improve the stereo matching accuracy in the ill-posed regions.
 Besides, we apply two techniques to reduce computational cost: breadth-first search (BFS) and zeroing attention weights in edge estimation.
Uncertainty has been an important topic in machine learning for many years (Koller & Friedman, 2009).
 It is witnessed that some child models have interference with each other, and the degree of this interference varies depending on different child models.
 Some parameters τ and r in MMES are corresponded with a kernel size and a filter size in ConvNet.
 The experimental results on 9 well-known benchmark datasets for the graph classification task show that both our supervised and unsupervised U2GNN models produce new state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracies in most of benchmark cases.
 The two sets of parameters are coupled in an `2 regularization.
Equipped with SplitLBI, our key idea of BoN comes from progressively growing networks by checking the parameters within Over-Par and Stru-Spa set.
 While our method is a simple extension of policy gradient algorithms, it adds a variance criterion to the optimization problem and introduces a novel rejection sampling procedure.
 Despite those efforts toward a more realistic setting of Continual Learning, one can notice that, most of the time, results are proposed in the case of a sequence of batches of multiple classes.
In this paper, we propose adversarial networks of positron image memory module based on attention mechanism.
 However, molecular graphs are highly sparse in general: degree of each node atom is at most four (valency), and only few kind of atoms comprise the majority of the molecules (less diversity).
 This metric is proportional to the total energy when the model is executed on ideal hardware, where energy consumption for a single multiply-accumulate (MAC) computation is proportional to the squared effective amplitude of the individual weight parameter used for the MAC computation.
 See fig. 1.
 By optimizing for per-instance uncertainty and predictive accuracy, the network allocates the uncertainty to spread the representation and prediction of the hard-to-classify instances so as to downweight their influence on parameter learning.
 In Austin’s framework, the locution is the literal meaning of an utterance, while the illocution is the goal that the utterance tries to achieve.
 In some experimental settings, our method outperforms other methods by a large margin.
 Because of this, we replace the principle of slowness with the information-bottleneck of the VAE and condition the reconstruction term on previous observations using a conditional VAE (CVAE, Sohn et al., 2015) to remove constant features.
 Finally, we show an application of MoE-Sim-VAE on a real-world clustering problem in biology on multiple datasets.
 In offline distillation which utilizes a pre-trained model as a teacher network, many methods such as FitNet (Romero et al., 2014), attention transfer (AT) (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016a) and factor transfer (FT) (Kim et al., 2018) make use of this intermediate feature representation as a target to learn for the student network, but in online distillation, to the best of our knowledge, no feature map-based knowledge distillation method has been proposed.
 Taking steps towards minimizing the SFD and SLD simultaneously, several works (Zhang et al., 2013; Gong et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2019) provide a theoretical analysis with additional constraints on distributions p and q, such as a linearity assumption between p(x|y) and q(x|y) (Zhang et al., 2013), which does not necessarily hold in many real applications.
 In certain scenarios, when agents do not have the complete knowledge or power to compute these properties, our setting enables elicitation of individual sample points.
 Thus, it is a more favorable choice for certain applications such as distributed optimization (Rajkumar & Agarwal, 2012; Agarwal et al., 2018; Jayaraman et al., 2018).
One major question is how to define calibration for regression, where the model outputs a continuous distribution over possible predictions.
A naive attempt to extend Yoon et al., (2018) to the dosage setting might involve trying to define a discriminator that takes as input an entire dose-response curve for each treatment from the generator (with the outcome for the observed treatment-dosage pair replacing the generated one) and that tries to determine the factual treatment-dosage pair.
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
We make the following contributions:
 We prove VRMPO needs O( −3) sample trajectories to achieve an -approximate firstorder stationary point ( -FOSP) (Nesterov, 2004).
 Using a distributed embeddings table improves the memory locality of both training embeddings and using them for inference, compared to on-server training with a centralized and potentially very large user embedding table.
 We then describe our regularization method, and illustrate its application to a toy gridworld problem.
In line of such observations, in this paper we propose a simple yet effective Annealing Mechanism for Adversarial Training Acceleration, which we call Amata, that gradually controls the degree of which the inner maximization is solved as the training proceeds.
 However, it suffers many problems, such as mismatches of angle, lighting, depth-of-field and object position, which is hard to avoid.
 In our analysis, we use more powerful model-based saliency techniques and show that the magnitude of the shift of the saliency map due to adversarial perturbations often exceeds the L2 distance between the saliency maps of different natural images.
 Under an asynchronous distributed setting, (Mitliagkas et al., 2016) observe that running SGD asynchronously is similar to adding a momentum-like term to SGD; they also provide experimental evidence that naively setting β = 0.9 would result in a momentum “overdose”, leading to suboptimal performance.
5% over a model trained with the entire dataset.
 Instead of trying to remember every single detail, human vision focuses more on the general concept of the object/scene, which favors a combined perception of both local and non-local information (Bubić et al., 2010).
 Experiments on a number of data sets demonstrate that our model compares favorably both in multi-labels classification performance (micro-F1, example-based F1, precision and accuracy) and extendability (able to modify to more and complex tasks) against state-of-the-art methods for multi-label learning.
 While being close to traditional GANs in terms of generation quality, RPGAN allows natural interpretability and efficient model updates with new data.
 Another line of work studies how to incorporate more general ground cost functions than the l2-metric (Adler & Lunz, 2018; Mallasto et al., 2019; Dukler et al., 2019).
 Our proposed CDSA mechanism models self-attention crossing all dimensions jointly yet in a dimension-wise decomposed way, preventing the size of attention maps from being too large to be tractable.
 In comparison with five strong and off-the-shelf baselines, the empirical results clearly show that our new DAC approach can attain consistent and significant improvements.
 This smart framework contribution of our work named EJ-Head (Effective Joint Head), including three operations: “Interleaving”,“Enriched Feature” and “Boundary Refinement”.
 Empirically, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy results among methods using the same evaluation protocol but with significant reductions in memory (1/8th of Liu et al., 2019) and search time (70% of Liu et al., 2019).
 We show that there is a significant difference in logit distributions between regular MNIST images and OOD and adversarial images, but this difference is not present to the same extent after the softmax function is applied.
 Our regret analysis of NeuralUCB is built on recent results on optimization and generalization of deep neural networks (Jacot et al., 2018; Arora et al., 2019; Cao and Gu, 2019a).
 Random sampling is not an ideal solution as it tends to select more testing data in order to represent the whole testing data.
 We find that these positive aspects apply to conditional INNs (cINNs) as well.
 Wu et al., (2016) first applied this network to the 3D point cloud generation field, and named it as 3DGAN and achieved great results.
 Chu & Liu (2018) proposes a similar idea in the multi-document summarization setting.
 While current continual learning approaches typically do not include this thread yet, it can be considered crucial to any system and a necessity in order to avoid encoding task labels and distinguishing seen from unknown data.
 Such penalty term is necessary for the strategy of penalizing TCmean in the view of Theorem 1.
Our main contribution in this work is four-fold:
 Visual randomisation substantially increases the complexity of the imagebased actor’s task.
 These methods, such as Bauschke & Lewis (2000); Iusem (1991); Iusem & De Pierro (1990), traditionally require us to cycle through all the constraints which is not feasible with metric constraints.
 For image classification, we test on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
 We show that in the FSL setting, our global consistency guided by our prototypical random walk loss adds a learning value compared to local consistency losses as in VAT (Miyato et al., 2018).
Overall, our principal contributions are the following:
 We show that in many cases TriMap outperforms all the competitor non-linear methods by means of global score and provides comparable local accuracy.
 That is, f can be split into a composition of functions f(x) = (ψ ◦ φ)(x) for x ∈ X , φ : X → Rm and ψ : Rm → Y .
Our work is also related to studies of competitive information diffusion, see Alon et al., (2010); Etesami & Başar (2014).
However, if we consider the data generated by the same thermostat operating in different buildings, much more data is available.
Being able to detect out-of-distribution examples is critical for improvements in many other important applications, including semisupervised learning and continual learning.
 One could simply identify the taxon at the finest level of the taxonomy and then extract the taxa at all levels of the tree above it by following the path to the root.
 We designed an iterative knowledge distillation algorithm that treats a deterministic GNN as a teacher network while considering our proposed Subjective Bayesian GNN model (a realization of our proposed framework for a specific GNN) as a distilled network.
 We observe that TopK-SGD achieves very similar performance to the original distributed SGD (Dense-SGD), while RandK-SGD has much slower convergence than TopK-SGD.
In summary, this paper makes the following key contributions:
 To be more specific, we introduce a discriminator in the latent space which tries to separate the generated code vectors from the encoder network and the ideal code vectors sampled from a prior distribution, i.g,, a standard Gaussian distribution.
 Specifically, we derive meta-VI first for α-divergence based VI, then extend it to f -divergence family and provided a novel parameterization of f -divergence which is then used in meta-VI.
Our contributions.

 In contrast, the closely related APROX (Asi & Duchi, 2019) and L4 (Rolinek & Martius, 2018) use respectively two and four hyper-parameters for their learning-rate.
 Publishing the best trained representations for easy reuse in transfer learning applications1.
 This provides an upper bound on the magnitude of the eigenvalues of the Hessian or the curvature values of the classification network.
 In addition, performance is affected by how nodes are shared across tasks.
 We posit that the presented method can be the foundation of a broader class of RL algorithms that can choose seamlessly between learning through RL to supervised adaptive imitation.
 Most algorithms for tree learning need global statistical information to select split points and straightforward modifications such as (Ben-Haim & Tom-Tov, 2010) typically yield lower accuracy compared to learning from full data at once, yet deep neural networks show great potential for continual learning (Parisi et al., 2018).
 Though our derivation remains formal, this is the first time that the mean field model of the ResNet has been considered.
 We shed the light on the importance of the approximation of the gradient of the potential, and we show how to achieve this using Hermite and Taylor learning.
 We decompose the turbulent flow into three components, each of which is approximated by a specialized U-net to preserve invariance properties.

 (c) Converting non-binary relations into cliques.
 While it has been proposed for adversarial attacks robustness (Lyu et al., 2015; Ross & Doshi-Velez, 2018; Roth et al., 2018; Ororbia II et al., 2017; Hein & Andriushchenko, 2017; Jakubovitz & Giryes, 2018; Simon-Gabriel et al., 2018), experimental evidence has been mixed, in particular, input gradient regularization has so far not been competitive with multi-step adversarial training.
 Therefore, the gradients which guide updates in the deep network can characterize straight edge information that has not been learned.
In this paper, we develop a neural program generation model for asking questions in an informationsearch game similar to “Battleship” used in previous work (Gureckis & Markant, 2009; Rothe et al., 2017; 2018).
As this is a newly proposed task, we also introduce two new datasets, Enron-Context and RedditContext, collected via crowdsourcing.
 Our experiments suggest that our TeamReg objective provides a dense learning signal that helps to guide the policy towards coordination in the absence of external reward, eventually leading it to the discovery of high performing team strategies in a number of cooperative tasks.
 Second, for each test example, the worst-case adversarial example, i.g,, with highest confidence, is selected from multiple white- and black-box attacks.
 This work includes the following contributions:
 To address this challenge, we define a new loss function that uses the weighted mean and standard deviation of the tree search statistics to update the pre-trained policy.
To explore the possibility of training IAF vocoder without distillation in this parallel system, we also propose an alternative approach, WaveVAE, which can be trained from scratch within the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework (Kingma and Welling, 2014).
 The first is that most of the models parameters are trained from scratch.
 We defer discussion of our approach to Section 3.
 Examples include network dissection (Bau et al., 2017), which evaluates the alignment between individual hidden units and semantic concepts, and learning perceptuallyaligned representations from robust training (Engstrom et al., 2019).
 Motivated by this observation, we design a feature leveling network structure that can automatically separate low level features from high level features to avoid mixture effect.
 To remove filters, we measure each filter’s contribution (activation magnitude) toward recognition of a target object class.
 The disadvantage of current decision-based and score-based black-box attacks is that every adversarial example is synthesized by numerous queries.
 In this example, the optimal normalized cuts is 0.286 (Equation 1), and as we can see, the CNC loss also converges to this value (Figure 1(c)).
 On the other hand, it also skillfully avoids gradient vanishing and exploding problem (Li et al., 2018) of LSTM since only few steps are required by multi-channel LSTM.
 The SR training process should recover this down-scaled mapping in a reverse manner.
 However, rather than using conventional token masking methods, we adopt chemically-relevant auxiliary tasks.
 We refer to these networks over subroutines as neural execution engines (NEEs).
 While this recommendation is good for some regimes, it can be misleading when uncertainty is high.
 Previous efforts to change the noise distribution to handle disconnectedness has exclusively taken the form of sampling from a mixture of Gaussians rather than the typical single Gaussian (with sampling fixed and uniform over the mixture).
 Yet having humans manually indicate their preferences through explicit means like pressing a button (e.g, Christiano et al., (2017)) or submitting a feedback report, does not scale.
One way to contruct the hierarchical policy learning is by adopting the option-critic framework (Bacon et al., 2017) to generate the sub-goals automatically.
 While many techniques exist to deal with this issue (Williams & Peng, 1990; Mujika et al., 2018), they do not solve the secondary problem of significant memory requirements for LM parameter updates.
Following (Hu et al., 2017), we compare against the results in (Wang et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016; Li & Yu, 2015; Zhao et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2017) and achieve ω-Fβ scores, PASCAL-S 0.
 To avoid biasing the model to such duplicated code, we perform deduplication using the method of Allamanis (2018).
 In this direction, there is less concern about the embedding power of GNN, but more about the design of the training procedures (what is the data and label for training) and how to incorporate the trained models within the decision procedures.
 While Miyato et al., (2015) use local distributional smoothness, based on the robustness of a model’s distribution around a data point, to regularize outcomes, Pereyra et al., (2017) penalized highly confident outputs directly.
 We lay the ground rules for quantitative estimation and qualitative sampling to be satisfied by an ideal factorization method for a multi-scale architecture.

 To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to report improvements via learning for combinatorial algorithms.
 Our contribution is motivated by three advantages:
In this work, we propose an alternative generative mechanism based on the framework of Restricted Kernel Machines (RKMs) (Suykens, 2017), called Generative RKM (Gen-RKM).
 These methods combining handicraft rules are not only difficult to achieve an optimal solution, but also sensitive to problem settings.
 Due to the abstractness of attributes, the classifier-based methods achieve lower performance on attribute recognition than that on the object recognition, which further leads to the lowaccuracy of attribute-object pair recognition.
 A perfectly robust model f with Rrob(f) = 0 is also perfectly accurate for natural learning.
 The core idea behind BTS is simple and elegant: the correctness of an answer does not rely on its popularity, but rather whether it is “surprisingly” popular or not - here an answer that has a higher posterior (computed from reports of the crowds) than its prior is taken as being “surprisingly” popular, and should be considered as the true answer.
 7: end forby taking a weighted average of these perturbed points.
 For image B, the mouth region (green point) has a low activation which means the activation between the mouth and the whole image A is low compared to the overall activation (similarity).
 Meanwhile, in survival analysis, a standard approach would involve learning a survival model using all the patients’ feature vectors and labels but the model would not learn thematic structure in the different features, e.g, topics.
 That is, using the von Mises expansion (Fernholz (2012)) — a variant of Taylor series expansion for statistical functionals — we represent the (counter-factual) model parameters that would have been learned on LOO versions of the training dataset in terms of an infinite series of higher-order influence functions (HOIFs) for the model parameters trained on the complete dataset.
In this paper, we take a different tack and instead propose to represent the inference process modeled by a neural network Pφ:max φ,θEτ∼Pφ  p(y|s0,x, τ ;Fθ)  (2)The neural network Pφ represents the distribution over all possible inference trajectories in the graph model.
 For a neural network model, this goal can be easily achieved by using different output layers to readout the final-layer representations.
Compared to the standard Bloom filter, learned Bloom filter (LBF) uses a machine learning model to answer keys with high score s(x).
 In phase 2, we select the winning ticket with differential privacy, making sure that we pick the ticket with a small number of parameters and with high utility via our custom score function (details in Section 3.3.1).
 Both trainable attention module and post hoc attention are implemented.
 The demonstrations are then used to initialize an RL policy, which can be refined with a classic RL method such as TRPO (Schulman et al., 2015).
 The observed entropy rate amplification (as seen in Table 1) demonstrates that this is not only of theoretical concern.
 We call the whole procedure uniformly as discriminability distillation learning (DDL).
 The scalability makes it possible to pinpoint clues for the salient explanation, which is not feasible with the nonparameterized approaches (Mahendran & Vedaldi, 2016; Zhou et al., 2016; Zeiler & Fergus, 2013; Petsiuk et al., 2018; Zintgraf et al., 2017; Fong & Vedaldi, 2017).
Empirically, we show that our estimated advantage function is closer to ground-truth advantage function Aπ than existing advantage estimation methods such as Monte-Carlo and Generalized Advantage Estimation (Schulman et al., 2015b).
(1) is that the dependency (covariance) matrix of all the feature channels after normalization is scaled by γγT.
 To efficiently compute posterior samples z̃1:T , we learn an amortized inference network qφ(z1:T |v1:T ) for the “collapsed” NLDS model p(z1:T ,v1:T ).
 This effect helps us get rid of the estimation of noise rates.
 Finally, having laid the groundwork for comparing trajectories via behavior-driven trajectory scores, we address our core question by introducing two new on-policy RL algorithms:• Behavior Guided Policy Gradients (BGPG): We propose to replace the KL-based trust region from Schulman et al., (2015) with a WD-based trust region in the PPE space.
1 of the Appendix for more information.
 This approximation ruins the beautiful arrow pattern, and thus ignores the multi-community influence of some seminal papers.
 We refer to the above phenomenon as the “small learning rate dilemma” (see more details in Section 3).
The key step to prove our first claim is a new bound of the spectral norm of the forward process for ResNet with τ ≤ 1/Ω( √ L).
Recently, deep correlation Siamese networks have been central components in state-of-the-art tracking approaches (Li et al., 2019; 2018; Bertinetto et al., 2016).
 They adopted complex optimization techniques to alleviate the problem.
3Besides highlighting the pixels within the dog for the images of dogs, the relevance scores should also be discriminative at various parts of the dog, such as higher scores on the head than legs.
 Increasing feature channels stored in each spatial cell costs parameters, but adding more cells incurs no such cost, decoupling memory size from the number of parameters.
 Can CSC based image SR show highly competitive results with recent state-of-theart methods (Dong et al., 2016; Mao et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2016a;b; Tai et al., 2017a;b; Tong et al., 2017; Lim et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018)? To answer this question, the following issues need to be considered:Framework Issue.
In this paper, we present a simple approach for improving model robustness under the framework of adversarial training.
 It starts with several random points without using any prior knowledge on the task.
 We will begin with a short introduction to simulations in JAX MD followed by a brief description of JAX and some architectural choices underlying JAX MD.
In summary, the contributions of this work are four-fold:
 We propose a soft dynamic recursion mechanism that dynamically and softly learns the recursive depth of the model at a token-level.
 This constraint can also be met via a network width of 0.25, 1.0 by adjusting the input resolution from {224, 192, 160, 128} during test time.
 The performance improvement over existing PBL methods ranges from 3% to 60%.
 For any new and unseen environment, it does not require the human to go through the training phase again, and assumes no prior knowledge about the optimal state-action pairs of the environment.
 Because the teacher is a function of the training data alone, g itself is a functional of the training data alone and is otherwise independent of the unknown distribution that generated that data.
The contributions of this study are as follows:
 Many existing prediction methods share their spatial and temporal feature extractors universally across all time-steps and/or all regions.
 Furthermore, we show that the Set-HBAE works well as a method for few-shot classification on ShapeNet (Chang et al., 2015) relative to a supervised baseline, especially in the small data regime.
 One can add or multiply distributions defined by the energy functions (as in mixtures (Shazeer et al., 2017; Greff et al., 2019) or products (Hinton, 2002) of experts).
 These methods assume that due to their anomalous nature outlier points will not be mapped to the encouraged prior distribution while the inliers will be, and consequently outliers will occur in low-probability regions of the prior distribution (19; 21) Figure 2 (b).
 On the other hand, LIME consistently underperforms in comparison to the other models.
 The phrase is fed to the generator to complete the remaining part of the explanation.
 Given the stability term does not rely on ground truth labels, unlabeled data can be used to minimize this term and thus improve the generalization ability.
 To combat this issue, various pair mining methods have been proposed to complement the design of loss function, such as hard (semi-hard) mining for triplet loss (Schroffet al., (2015)), distance weighted sampling (DWS) for margin loss (Wu et al., (2017)), MS sampling for MS loss (Wang et al., (2019)).
 Thus, it can model the joint distribution of the dataand the mask together and avoid limiting assumptions such as MCAR, and is optimized efficiently with a single variational objective.
We explore the impact of various pruning granularities, sparsity levels, and learning-rate schedules on the network’s convergence as well as adversarial robustness for CNNs like Resnet-50 (He et al., 2015) on ImageNet and tinyImagenet (CS231N, 2015).
 We call it Gaussian Component Mean Matching (GCMM).
 Concurrently, Garipov et al., (2018) proposed learning Bezier curves and polygonal chains and Draxler et al., (2018) proposed learning a curve using nudged elastic band energy between two models.
As a consequence of Theorem 1, the generalization bound is improved by √ n! by the invariant property.
 We conduct experiments on real datasets to verify our ideas.
 To answer this question, we conduct comprehensive experiments on several datasets with learned RealNVP priors and just one latent variable, which even shows advantage over some deep hierarchical VAEs with powerful posteriors.
 Efficient computational approaches are developed to enable our method in practice.
 ,K that leave the marginal distribution unchanged.
 In addition to these experiments, we verified whether our model uses information of remote nodes by reducing the percentage of labeled data.
 Through our analysis, we obtain insights into how to improve the accuracy and reliability of our approach.
 Unfortunately, there is (at least explicitly) no such scale-space extrema operations in all existing CNNs.
 We show this simple random distance prediction enables us to achieve expressive representations with no manually labelled data.
An overview of our proposed method is shown in Figure 1.
Our contributions are summarized below:
 And trivial attempts can easily lead to even worse performance than standard deep networks (Han et al., 2018b).
 A network architecture is proposed for training our model consisting of four components: a siamese sub-network, a similarity metric learning component, a convolutional network, and a decision layer.
 In this work, we study the possibilities of finding more effective key steps, and of finding them automatically without human knowledge.
 Based on a mean-field analysis, we also show the consistency of the proposed particle SGD.
 In simple terms, an empowered agent is able to reliably reach a diverse set of states in the environment, while avoiding states that are difficult to reach reliably.
 We justify this both theoretically and experimentally for a ReLU network (network with ReLU activation units) that was indeed used in Lee et al., (2018a).
 We discuss related work in Section 2, describe the theoretical background in Section 3 and define Composite Q-learning, MVE-TD3 and TD3(∆) in Section 4.
 This is in contrast with existing ensemble-based methods that count on the random initialization and/or bootstrapped experience sampling for the ensemble to approximate the posterior.
Keeping with the theme of simplicity with the goal of meeting Occam’s principle, we also propose a simple non-uniform sampling method for selecting transitions from the replay buffer during training.
Our paper makes the following contributions:
 Furthermore, the posterior collapse frequently occurs when using more sophisticated decoder models (Bowman et al., 2015; Kingma et al., 2016).
 By incorporating the variance reduction technique into sparsityconstrained optimization domain, Li et al., (2016b) proposed a stochastic variance reduced gradient hard thresholding (SVRG-HT) algorithm, which can converge more quickly and obtain a smaller estimation error than SG-HT.
 As an added bonus, we find that CRL is also able to achieve better visual representation learning than other data collection methods, as it actively sees diverse inputs that surprise it.
Both tasks for MAML, and clients for FL, are heterogeneous.
 However, we note that these studies provided global convergence and generalization analyses of the (stochastic) gradient descent for challenging settings (i.g,, deep ReLU networks) by making a similar but different assumption than ours.
 We focus on analyzing GANs for learning a multi-pointdistribution.
However recently questions have been rasied over these claims.
 Note that if the infrequent predicates are not recognized, the unseen predicates are more unlikely to be recognized.
In summary, our main contributions are as follows:
 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark of this kind.
 This can be achieved by training the hallucinator end-to-end with the learner, and back-propagating a classification loss based on groundtruth labels of validation data (Wang et al., 2018).
 Samples whose class conditionals are smaller than the pre-chosen thresholds will be deemed as off-manifold, and prediction requests on them will be rejected.
 On other commonly used benchmark datasets, CIFAR-FS, mini-ImageNet, and Omniglot, its performance is competitive with existing methods.
 Our paper makes the following contributions.
 We prove that X-regularization eliminates the increase in test error upon data augmentation in the case of noiseless linear regression.
 We factorize a weight matrix in each layer into two low-rank matrices after training the DNNs via singular value decomposition (SVD).
A harder benchmark would involve selecting different cluster semantics across episodes.
 Furthermore, our findings highlight the the desirability of adversarial robustness as a goal beyond the standard security and reliability context.
 Specifically, combined with one-shot approach, VAENAS achieves 2.26% test error on CIFAR-10 and 75.8% accuracy on ImageNet, outperforming state-ofthe-art NAS methods.
 We provide new empirical benchmarks for soft-SSL on directed hypergraphs and make the code available to foster reproducible research (Section 5).
 Our meta goal-generation framework is built on top of the architecture of PEARL (Rakelly et al., 2019) and a two level hierarchy inspired by HAC (Levy et al., 2019).
 Figure 2) and training on them can harm performance.
Multi-objectivization (Knowles et al., 2001) is the process of transforming a single objective problem into a multi-objective problem.
 In this case the model suffers high accuracy loss.
In this work, we try to improve GANs with regards to model compatibility in classification problems.
 Notably, this level of parallelism is present at varying depths which differs from existing works on parallel MCTS (Chaslot et al., 2008).
 The experiments are carried out on CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) and ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015).
 Hence, causal models generalize better even with change in the distributions.
 Our main contributions are as follows.
Recently, researchers have proposed two main categories of communication compression techniques for reducing communication cost in DSGD and DMSGD.
 We experimentally identify two key differences between networks trained in the vanilla teacherstudent setup and networks trained on the MNIST task (Sec.3).
 It has been suspected for a long time that stochastic gradients sometimes generalize better than full batch gradient descent (Heskes & Kappen, 1993; LeCun et al., 2012).
ly/code_ atpcurr1.
 To quantify this informativeness, we take inspiration from information-theoretic active learning (MacKay, 1992) and leverage probabilistic inference techniques to maintain a posterior distribution over the parameters of a deep generative model, in particular of a variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014).
Recent work on understanding loss landscapes (Fort & Jastrzebski, 2019; Draxler et al., 2018; Garipov et al., 2018) allows us to investigate this hypothesis.
This paper makes three main contributions:
 These dilations are done sequentially for all the layers from the input to the last classification stage (Section 3.3).
 Therefore, our results may shed light on the generalization capabilities of networks initialized with pre-trained models commonly used in meta/transfer learning.
 We apply fictitious play (FP) (Brown, 1951; Fudenberg & Kreps, 1993) or independent reinforcement learning (Littman, 1994; Hu et al., 1998; Bu et al., 2008).
The three tasks are handled by a single deep neural network and are jointly optimized.
 In particular, leading extreme classifiers based on bag-of-words (BoW) features (Prabhu et al., 2018b) and pretrained embeddings (Jain et al., 2019) are highly scalable but inaccurate for documents having only 3 or 4 words.
 The term season is used to represent the period of time before behavior begins to repeat itself.
On the other hand, there has been incredible progress in recent years in generative modeling of raw pixels and audio waveforms using maximum likelihood.
Deep learning (LeCun et al., 2015) offers great potentials to overcome these challenges.
 We apply the method to three simulated tasks, including a problem to find a trajectory of a YuMi robot end-effector, to open a door of a box, pressing a button inside the box and closing the door.
 Recent studies (Chen et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019) have found that exploiting dependencies between W(l) and U(l) leads to reducing the number of trainable parameters while retaining the performance of LISTA.
 At the same time, our composition can learn different receptive fields that cannot be realized in the standard parameterization of free-form filters.
 Relying on Iscen et al., (2019), and contrary to previous findings Wang et al., (2017); Gal et al., (2017), we show that this consistently brings a dramatic accuracy improvement.
 We further propose three analytical approaches as shown in fig.  1: attribute-wise, model-wise, and bucketwise analyses that have the following characteristics accordingly: Attribute-wise (Sec.3.3.2) analysis could instruct us to find which factors matter for the NER tasks and figure out the commonality of factors across different NER datasets; Model-wise (Sec.3.3.1) analysis aims to investigate how different attributes influence the performance of models with different architectures and pre-trained knowledge; Bucket-wise (Sec.3.3.3) analysis diagnoses the strengths and weaknesses of existing models and helps us understand how different choices of datasets influence the model performance.
 Existing studies formulate the problem as nonlinear integer programming, and call for an exponential number of subtour elimination constraints to ensure the rationality of expanded metro lines (Gutiérrez-Jarpa et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2019), which hinders solving the problem efficiently.
Although, there are few GAN-based systems that produced state-of-the-art results for non-parallel VC.
 Hence, we created baselines by endowing a traditional embedding with some extra functionality to enable it to infer label sets.
 To address this point, we explicitly introduce a discriminator for separation of these two domains.
Our MCDA technique is highly sensitive, allowing very small differences in quantization behaviour to be detected.
 For example, graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) follow the architecture of standard CNNs, but replace the Euclidean convolution operator with linear filters constructed using the graph Laplacian.
 However, the classification accuracy of a STDP-learned SNN for complex datasets is much lower than a that of a DNN.
 This analysis motivates the need for task dependent parameter sharing in multi-task networks.
 The vector representation of the local image content is represented by a long vector, which rotates as the image undergoes deformation due to the pixel displacements.
 While recent meta-learning approaches focused on the few-shot learning problem, i.g,learning to learn with few examples, we extend their use to the OCC problem, i.g,learning to learn with examples from only one class.
 Due to the discrete nature of text, data augmentation is a much harder problem in natural language processing (NLP) than in computer vision.
In addition, by reusing nonzero blocks within a weight matrix, we can stipulate (for example) that event e affects node block b in the same way in which event e′ affects node block b′.
) Unlike full-precision data-parallel SGD, where each processor is required to broadcast its local gradient in full-precision, i.g,, transmit and receive huge full-precision vectors at each iteration, quantization requires each processor to transmit only a few communication bits per iteration for each component of the stochastic gradient.
 In particular, Jacot et al., (2018) along with followup work (Lee et al., 2019; Chizat et al., 2019) showed that the distribution of functions induced by gradient descent for infinite-width networks is a Gaussian Process with a particular compositional kernel known as the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK).
 The goal is to capture some common sense knowledge about how classes relate to a range of differentiating contexts.
 For these reasons, we are not particularly interested in enforcing exact orthogonality constraints, but in the study of the effectiveness of an autoencoder-based memorization mechanism.
 In the first approach, a soft clustering of nodes is parameterized and learned.
 Unlike vanilla Transformer, Explicit Sparse Transformer only pays attention to the k most contributive states.
 It also allows us to consider the other weight distributions of sparse-Gaussian, sparse-uniform and sparse-discrete networks (see Definitions 2 - 4).
It is also important that the enhanced recognizability is not specific to any concrete neural networkbased recognition model, i.g,, the improvement on recognition performance is only achieved when the output images are evaluated on that particular model.
 Our method does not make any assumption on the nature of the image sequence, it does not require any prior knowledge like most methods used for physical images do.
 The heads share the same body network whose role is to provide a common feature representation.
 Importantly, we focus on sparse reward variants of the aforementioned environments (see Section 3).
The contributions of the proposed SemanticAdv are three-folds.
We also state some disadvantages of our method:• The initial state distribution in EI’s MCMC chain has to have higher entropy than the target.
 A recent study supports these claims, finding that many YouTube users “systematically migrate from commenting exclusively on milder content to commenting on more extreme content” (Ribeiro et al., 2019).
 Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and the ilk (Kipf & Welling, 2016) use a graph convolution opera-tion to capture the correlation between nodes in a graph.
 On the contrary, observations are considered seldom visited when the errors from the predicted flow are non-negligible.
 To begin, we exploit the similarity scores of all possible pairs of visual frame and word features to create frame-specific sentence representations and word-specific video representations.
007 seconds per energy estimate, which is marginal compared to the gain from DFT and may be improved with some obvious code optimisation.
 Further, the ability to providecommands and instructions to the policy enables easy human-robot interaction through language.
 As discussed above, LISTA provides an exemplar approach to bridge the connection between SR and NN in an explainable manner.
 In particular, we present a graph learning neural network that casts a graph learning problem as a data-driven similarity metric learning task for constructing a graph.
 The ablation study in Sec.4.2 confirms that the CoBRF boosts the performance compared to the baseline random forests.
 The result of the audio processing stage is the abstraction x(i).
 The uncertainty predicted by DBNN is comparable to that of BNN in various situations.
 At a so-called permutation point, where the distance between the input and output weight vectors of the two neurons vanishes, the indices of the two neurons can be interchanged at no extra cost.
 In this manner, our method can be applied to different tasks.
To alleviate the data sparsity issues, recent works (Das et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2015; Gupta et al., 2019) have shown that TM can be improved by introducing external knowledge, where they leverage pretrained word embeddings (i.g,, local view) only.
 We compare the performance of these regularization techniques to that without regularization, as well as the entropy regularization.
 In the second scenario, we assume that no pre-trained DCNN for the same objective is available.
 Also, we apply a simple but effective domain translation (DT) trick to mitigate the distribution discrepancy and thus DiVA can achieve better classification accuracy on past tasks.
” (Polosukhin, 2018)As Figure 1 illustrates, short puzzles can capture extremely difficult problems such as factoring or subset-sum as well as easy questions such as list reversal or solving (x+ 1)x+1 == 100100 for x.
In this work, we aim at more accurate universal sparse pattern search (see Figure 1 for an overview of our approach) motivated by our experiments and the conclusion from Loshchilov & Hutter (2018).
 This makes the model more interpretable and provides more useful structure for downstream tasks.
 To ensure no loss of accuracy, we design a novel error compensation to overcome the staleness for both vanilla and momentum SGD.
 For non-convexconcave games like GANs however, Nash equilibria need not be the right solution concept (see Berard et al., (2019) and Figure 2), which spurred a search for new solution concepts (Jin et al., 2019; Fiez et al., 2019).
 However, theUnder review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020method is limited and inflexible for analyzing a general case of deep neural networks.
 With our stochastic forward dynamics predictor, we can move part of the sampling process into the environment, physically grounding the random exploration of model-free agents.
 These indicative words for AI category should have much stronger relations among themselves than with other non-indicative words.
 In other words, the model would be more sensitive on the changes of those important or relevant features than the ones that are not.
 This image realism is thus enforced by the GAN training.
 First, we study how this approach can be employed in the VAE setting.
 Robins, 2004 proposed another replay technique, known as the pseudo-pattern rehearsal, to preserve the learned mappings by uniformly sampling random inputs and their corresponding outputs from networks and replaying them along with new task samples.
The question is, can competent brain circuits evolve this way? We offer theoretical evidence that this is indeed the case1.
 It can also inform search-based application in which one can search for “similar” texts while controlling various aspects of the desired similarity.
 Du et al., (2018b) showed that the convergence is provably guaranteed under certain over-parameterization conditions determined by the smallest eigenvalue of NTK.
 We account for both training regimes in the analysis by assuming a linear target function and noisy labels.
 As the efficiency of this algorithm is KL  q(z |x) || p(z) , we will refer to it as relative entropy coding (REC), and note that REC algorithms achieve bits-back efficiency (Hinton & Van Camp, 1993).
 Such a network partitions the input space RD based on the activation pattern of the network’s units (neurons).
 UCRL (Auer & Ortner, 2006) and UCAGG (Ortner, 2013) compute average rewards for choosing optimistic values.
 Our idea is a couple of steps further: we introduce a bias correction procedure into boosting, and explicitly estimate the noises in generated labels.
 In examples like the aforementioned TV in a maze, it may be more fruitful to instead optimize a latent model to be able to perform reward prediction.
In summary, our main contribution lies on:
 We employ training techniques based on reward shaping (Ng et al., 1999) and HER (Andrychowicz et al., 2017) to accelerate training the goal-conditioned policy.
Using a different theory in this paper, we propose a simple method to circumvent the problem.
We validate our multi-task learning framework extensively on different tasks, including graph classication, node classification, and text classification.
 Powering this framework is a novel collaborator selector algorithm that chooses the optimal adaptation collaborator for each target domain, before initiating the adaptation.
 The ICD coding models are finetuned on the generated features to achieve more accurate prediction for zero-shot codes.
 Addressing question 2, we find that the meta-learned initialization’s performance when being evaluated on a task is particularly sensitive to changes in the update routine’s hyperparameters (see Figure 2).
 For instance, LARS performs poorly for attention models like BERT.
 This model ensemble learning provides a more stable supervisory signal than the noisy model snapshots and provides a stable ground for progressive filtering to filter out potential noisy labels.
To address these aforementioned issues, in this paper, we present a novel reinforcement learning based generator-evaluator architecture that aims to: i) make full use of rich hidden structure information beyond the simple word sequence; ii) generate syntactically and semantically valid text while maintaining the consistency of train/test measurement; iii) model explicitly the global interactions of semantic relationships between passage and answer at both word-level and contextual-level.
 Besides, edge attributes are neither well modeled in the embedding-free model (Zanfir & Sminchisescu, 2018) since the edge information is derived from the concatenation of node features.
 Based on the computed node representation and between-node reachability, the structure relations can be obtained by computing the similar scores/relationships from reference nodes to unlabeled nodes in a graph.
 Thus, our method can be applied in environments with stochastic dynamics and continuous states, where the demonstrated states are not necessarily reachable by the agent.
 To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first successful example of deep architectures that substantially outperforms leading GBDT packages on tabular data.
 Note that the collaborative training strategy on the two networks is only adopted in the training process.
 In more detail, pairs of unlabelled images are compared via their representation vectors.
 Further, these strategies do not guide how strongly we should correct for overestimation bias, nor how to determine—or control—the level of bias.
translation (Cettolo et al., 2014) as well as WMT’14 English-French translation show that we can match the performance of well tuned baseline models at up to 76% less computation (§4).
Particularly, we are interested in the Hoyer regularizer (Hoyer, 2004), which estimates the sparsity of a vector with the ratio between its `1 and `2 norms.
In other words, we disprove the common belief that the quality of architectures trained with and without weight sharing is similar.
Although regularization can be interpreted as a constraint from the duality theory, sometimes it may still be more desirable to use explicit constraints, for example, ∑ x2j ≤ α, where the summation is over the weights on the same layer.
 Our method has the advantages of no requirements in terms of extra memory or model capacity.
 In Figure 1, the neighborhoods of x and y are well separated in different branches of a tree.
 Elfeki et al., (2019) suggest approximating a given distribution by approximating the eigenvalues of the corresponding DPP.
 The meta-knowledge graph is then learned by summarizing the information from the corresponding prototype-based relational graphs of meta-training tasks.
 On the other hand, similar to GAN (Goodfellow et al., 2014), the estimate is a minimax optimization problem, which is solved by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in an alternating manner.
 For integer-only-arithmetic, we quantize the bias to fixed-point numbers by using a straight-forward method.
 To achieve this objective, we introduce a novel MIL task based on a new kind of bag level label called unique class count (ucc), which is the number of unique classes or the number of clusters among all the instances inside the bag.
This decomposition of generic and task-specific knowledge has clear advantages in tackling the previously mentioned problems.
 They can solve CVRP faster, but cannot beat classical OR solvers like LKH3 in term of solution quality.
 AutoQ comprises a high-level controller (HLC) and a low-level controller (LLC).
 So, we apply an additional approximate function to tackle the conditional prior problem.
 The proposed off-policy learning not only enjoys the property of optimality preserving (unbiasedness), but also largely reduces the variance of policy gradient because of its independence of the horizon and reward scale.
 We also look into the distribution shapes for the transformed clean and adversarial images and find that they are similar.
 The second contradiction is: considering the bell-shaped distribution of weight, it is well-motivated to assign higher resolution (i.g, smaller quantization interval) around the mean; however, such non-uniform quantization levels will introducehigh computational overhead.
In terms of applications, knowledge consistency between DNNs can be used to diagnose feature reliability of DNNs.
 Since CompositionNet is trained to generate photo-realistic output images, it is resolving reprojection errors as well as filling regions where no image content is available.
 Inspired by the significant role of algorithmic bias in the generalization of neural networks, it is natural to askDoes gradient descent based adversarial training enjoy any implicit bias property?
 Unlike question answering, a statement could contain compound facts, all of these facts need to be verified to predict the verdict.
 Whereas policy gradient methods are primarily motivated by interactions with the environment through randomized actions, ES is driven by optimization in high-dimensional parameter spaces with an expensive querying model.
 This allows us to optimize over the manifold of images with only a small number of optimization variables.
GNNs need input-dependent pruning to scale.
 In each execution, MI performs a global linear transformation on the inputs, which mixups the input x with a sampled clean example xs, i.g,, x̃ = λx+ (1− λ)xs (detailed in Alg. 1), and feed x̃ into the classifier as the processed input.
 The center loss (Wen et al., 2016) avoids the pair-wise or triplet-wise computation by minimizing the squared distancebetween the features and the corresponding class centers.
 Specifically, we show that a depth-2 model requires exponentially small initialization for incremental learning to occur, while deeper models only require the initialization to be polynomially small.
 For example, in the case of maze navigation, the agent learns to access information about the goal location only near natural bottlenecks, such as doorways.
 Further, a directed measure of reachability afforded by an arrow of time can be utilized for deriving an intrinsic reward signal to enable agents to learn complex skills in the absence of external rewards.
 We train the network on optical flow for binary classifying swim bouts and achieve superior performance when compared to the current state-of-the-art in bout classification (Semmelhack et al., (2014)).
 In this work, we borrow ideas from the representation learning literature (Bengio et al., 2013) in order to reduce selection bias and from the domain adaptation literature (Shimodaira, 2000) in order to account for the remainder selection bias that (might) still exist after its reduction.
 This shows the intrinsic difficulties of conventional GANs/VAEs cannot be eliminated, as shown in fig. 1.
 This structure in the environment is fundamentally logical in nature, and encodes a particular kind of conjunction; see Appendix I.
 Recently, Berthelot et al., (2019) propose MixMatch, which unifies several dominant SSL approaches in one framework and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
 The only exception we are aware of is Ding et al., (2018), which proposes to use maximal margin optimization for correctly classified examples.
Contributions of this study can be summarized as follows.
 Specifically, we show that in the linear setting MaSS converges exponen-tially for the same range of step sizes as plain SGD, and the optimal choice of step size for MaSS is exactly η∗ which is optimal for SGD.
 For these, self-supervision remains inferior to strong supervision even if millions of images are used for training.
 For this purpose, we perform a reproducible large scale experimental study1, training over 52 000 models on four different data sets.
 We give a more precise definition in Section 3; for now it suffices to note that almost all networks are general.
 In the second part of the paper, we propose to leverage such estimates of complexity to detect OOD inputs.
 During training, all existing parameters are frozen, and only the newly added ones are trained.
 We introduce Hidden Token Attribution, a quantification method based on gradient attribution.
 On the one hand, we are inspired by the success of AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2016; 2017), where a policy network is used to generate proposals for the Monte-Carlo tree search.
 Middle: fifty is unavailable during metatraining; it fails to generalize.
 Since finding a global minimum or even a local minimum in general nonconvex optimization can be NP hard (Anandkumar & Ge (2016); Nie (2015); Murty & Kabadi (1987); Nesterov (2000)), most of the papers in nonconvex optimization target at reaching an approximate second-order stationary point with additional assumptions like Lipschitzness in the gradients and the Hessian (e.g, Allen-Zhu & Li (2018); Carmon & Duchi (2018); Curtis et al., (2017); Daneshmand et al., (2018); Du et al., (2017); Fang et al., (2018; 2019); Ge et al., (2015); Jin et al., (2017; 2019); Kohler & Lucchi (2017); Lei et al., (2017); Lee et al., (2019); Levy (2016); Mokhtari et al., (2018); Nesterov & Polyak (2006); Reddi et al., (2018a); Staib et al., (2019); Tripuraneni et al., (2018); Xu et al., (2018)).

 The pruning decisions are guided by a criterion promoting alignment (matching) of the input graph spectrum with that of the graph filters.
 The Entity Typing task requires the model to recognize fine-grained types of specified entity mentions given short contexts.
 We summarize the contributions of this study as follows:
 This same representation can easily be leveraged for a bevy of other low-level optimizations (including: indirect branch prediction, value prediction, memory disambiguation) and opens up new possibilities for multi-task learning that were not previously possible with traditional heuristics.
 For example, the out-of-distribution examples in the MNIST dataset, from another perspective, are found to belong to the differences between the sets of examples in MNIST and the universal set.
 It is the key to recent developments that prove that (stochastic) gradient descent can find a global minimum for an overparameterized deep neural network (Allen-Zhu et al., 2018; Du et al., 2018b).
 We outline a few challenging desiderata any practical instantiation of this idea would however have to satisfy, and provide approaches to address each of these in turn.
 To explain the success of CapsNets over CNNs, we further diagnose the adversarial examples for CapsNets and find that 1) the success of the targeted reconstructive attack is highly dependent on the visual similarity between the source image and the target class.
 Such highly compositional languages also generalize better, because they perform well on a held-out validation set.
 Therefore we could gain query efficiency by performing queries in the embedding space.
 To quantify the discrepancy between two classifiers on one image, we propose a weighted distance over WordNet hierarchy (Miller, 1998), which is more semantically aligned with human cognition compared with traditional binary judgment (agreevs. disagree).
 This measure counts the number of times that the algorithm “makes mistakes” along the whole trajectory.
 We show that homotopy iterative thresholding algorithms lead to more efficient sparse coding implementations with fewer layers.
 The coreset approximation of neurons provably holds for any input; thus our compression is data-independent.

 For SSP one defines a fixed threshold s, such that the fastest worker is allowed to outpace the slowest one by at most s steps (“bounded staleness”).
 They used a scaled-up version of PPO (Schulman et al., (2017)), adopted the attention mechanism to compute the weight of choosing the target unit, with some of information selected from all information as input.
In addition to the main application of generating a realistic video from a 2D trajectory, the learned Pose2Frame network can be used for other applications.
 As our results and proofs show, generalizing certified robustness from top-1 to top-k predictions faces significant new challenges and requires new techniques.
 As both actions are underestimated, this will increase the estimate of the chosen action.
 Each element can adaptively aggregate information from all the other elements according to the compatibility defined on their contents, positions, categories, and etc.
 Illustrated in Figure 1(d), DKs learn free-form offsets on kernel coordinates to deform the original kernel space towards specific data modality, rather than recomposing data.
 It is important to highlight that Ensemble Distribution Distillation is a novel task which, to our knowledge, has not been previously investigated.
 Unfortunately, this method suffers from a degradation of the final accuracy, especially when scaling up the number of workers.
 β-VAEs and other works (Chen et al., 2016; Mathieu et al., 2016; Kulkarni et al., 2015; Higgins et al., 2017) address supervised or unsupervised disentanglement of latent variables related to what we formalize as extrinsic disentanglement of transformations acting on data points.

 The contribution of this work can be summarized as follows:
 Based on our experiments on these separate sets, we find that even the state-of-the-art models can only perform well on EASY set and struggle on HARD set as shown in Figure 1.
 Finally, we equip RAEs with a generative mechanism via a simple ex-post density estimation step on the learned latent space.
 In operation level, we reallocate the computation by introducing a powerful search space designed specially for object detection.
 Earlier bounds were in terms of product of these distances which led to an exponential dependency on depth.
 We follow initialization based strategy (Chen et al., 2019), with a training and fine-tuning phase, so that in the fine-tuning phase, the pre-trained parameters associated with Fθ(.) and Csup are frozen, and the few novel labeled graph samples are used to update the weights and attention learned by CGAT .
 Therefore, they often fail to scale to large and high dimensional environments.
 Our work develops a highly effective target-agnostic attack, exploiting the intrinsic characteristic of Softmax in transfer learning settings.
 Evaluation results indicate that (1) to achieve the state-of-the-art performance, our model only needs 1/8 training data (∼ 2.3k dialogues on Wizard and ∼ 0.4k dialogues on CMU DoG); (2) on Wizard, the model significantly outperforms the baseline models on out-of-domain documents even though the baselines have leveraged all training data, while our model is only learned with 1/16 training data; and (3) the model performs comparably well on in-domain and out-of-domain documents in a low-resource setting.
 We parametrize the actor and critic by linear and quadratic functions, respectively, and prove that such a parameterization encompasses the optimal policy of each agent.
 More importantly, these networks admit an exact representation in Boolean logic (Narodytska et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2018).
 We find that the use of property signatures leads to a dramatic improvement in the performance of the synthesizer, allowing it to synthesize over twice as many programs in less than one-tenth of the time (Section 4).
 Our V4D achieves very competitive performance on the three benchmarks, and obtains evident performance improvement over its 3D counterparts.
 Guided by our new understanding of the effects of k, we propose an elegant method to tackle performance degradation in mismatched k cases.
 However, the models have a factorised prior that treats scene components as independent.
 Specifically, we learn the mapping from a simple prior to the filter space using neural networks, here referred to as filter generators.
 In particular, attributes can be shifted in proportion to the variability of that attribute in the training data.
 Selecting regions, instead of entire images, allows the algorithm to focus on the most relevant parts of the images, as shown in Figure 1.
 Chen et al., (2017) introduce a principled approach by using gradient based optimization.
 However, we discover that a much more effective, simpler, and under-explored strategy is adopting budget-aware learning rate schedules — if we know that we are limited to a single epoch, one should tune the learning schedule accordingly.
 This motivates us to consider the effect of sparsity on the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) required for retrieval with an inverted index.
 Though Korda and La (2015) empirically verified that VRTD has better convergence accuracy than vanilla TD learning, some technical errors in the analysis in Korda and La (2015) have been pointed out in follow up studies Dalal et al., (2018a); Narayanan and Szepesvári (2017).
 This way, an imitating behavior policy may be learned to minimize the divergence without the use of explicit rewards.
 In Section 3, we derive an analytic lower bound on the all-layer margin for neural nets with smooth activations which depends on the output margin normalized by other data-dependent quantities.
 We also provide technical explanations for the effectiveness of our path connection method based on model weight space exploration and similarity analysis of input gradients for clean and tampered data.
Finally, we show an application of our work by drawing connections to federated learning (FL) (Li et al., 2019).
 One example is BM-25 (Robertson et al., 2009), which remains to be the most commonly-used (Nguyen et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017; 2019a) and hard to beat (Chapelle & Chang, 2011; Lee et al., 2019) algorithm.
We investigate properties of our method on a dynamic simulated autonomous driving task (see fig. 1).
 CM3 solved all domains significantly faster than IAC and COMA (Tan, 1993; Foerster et al., 2018), and solved four out of five environments significantly faster than QMIX (Rashid et al., 2018).
 Here, we provide novel linear-algebraic tools to visualize and interpret these strategies through a local analysis of the Jacobian of the denoising map.
 In our experiments, we demonstrate the expressive power of BQNs.
 Having a confidence set would both help the doctor estimate the confidence of the prediction (i.g,, smaller confidence sets imply higher confidence), but also give a sense of the set of possible diagnoses.
 On LSTM, compared to 8-bit uniform quantization PG boosts perplexity per word (PPW) by 1.2% with 2.8× less compute on the Penn Tree Bank (PTB) dataset.
 This is a significantly-sized subset that poses a wide variety of reasoning challenges and allows for controlled development and testing of models.
 There are also some recent works that attempt to utilize the knowledge on neural architectures learned from previous tasks, such as Wong et al., (2018); Shaw et al., (2018).
 Next, the similarity matrix is used by, for example, Kmeans to partition the points into different clusters.
 At some point in training, suppose the gradient of a, ga, can be decomposed into two orthogonal components ga1 and ga2 of roughly equal magnitude, i.g,, there are two, equally good, independent ways in which the network can better fit a (by using say two disjoint parts of the network).
 A similar approach has been recently implemented by current state of the art language model (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018).
 The result sequence contains the inherent structured representation in which we can apply the fertility concept.
 Incremental Updates.
 The additional 2 batch statistics involved in BP are associated with gradients of the model, and have never been well discussed before.
 The communication cost is measured by the total amount of data communicated in the network.
 This body of neuroscience work suggests that a sleep-like activity may be applied to ANNs to enable the network to extract the gist of the training data without being constrained by the statistics of a specific training data set.
 Moreover, when specializing to appropriate Gaussian random linear transformations, we show that, as long as the neural network is wide enough, both GD and SGD with zero initialization on all hidden weights can find the global minimum.
 Further, we show the equivalence for these two differentsettings of hidden variables using the properties of the spatial point process.
 In terms of overall accuracy (including user-defined types), LAMBDANET achieves a top1 accuracy of around 64.2%, which is 55.2% (absolute) higher than the TypeScript compiler.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
 From our extensive study across three long-tail datasets, ImageNet-LT, Places-LT and iNaturalist, we make the following intriguing observations:
 As an example we show five color-coded and plot their distributions.
 This is due to unbounded convex losses putting much weight on the outliers (with a large loss value) when minimizing the losses (Masnadi-Shirazi & Vasconcelos, 2009).
 Figure 1 compares testing and memory cost between BatchEnsemble and naive ensemble.
 Another criticism of FA algorithms is the lack of rigorous mathematical justification and convergence guarantees of the performed computations.
 However, due to either the inherent biases or difficulty to learn the parameters of the baselines, it is unclear how effective these newly proposed estimators are in backpropagating the gradients through a sequence of discrete variables (Yin et al., 2019).
 To diagnose this instability, we consider the smoothness of the GAN’s loss function.
 Second, the effectiveness of early stopping indicates that clean labels are somewhat easier to fit than wrong labels; therefore, adding an auxiliary variable could help “absorb” the noise in the labels, thus making the neural net itself not over-fitting.
 It could be adapted to other factors of variations such as rotations, change of brightness, contrast, color or more sophisticated transformations like local deformations.
 Previous approaches (Lutter et al., 2019; Greydanus et al., 2019) require data in the form of generalized coordinates and their derivatives up to the second order.
 The necessary condition of critical points,∇A 14 ‖AY ‖ 4 4 = ∇A 〈Λ,AA∗ − I〉 for some Lagrangian multipliers Λ, implies:(AY )◦3Y ∗ = (Λ + Λ∗)A.
These location sensors indirectly observe the events of interest.
The contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows.
 These approaches are advantageous in the sense that they do not rely on abstracting the game, and accordingly their strategies can improve continuously with more optimization iterations.
 To apply our method and resolve the ambiguity, we find a distinguishing input x∗, in this case a narrower P4 Pro device, on which some of the candidate programs produce different outputs.
The main contribution of the proposed work are summarized as follows:
 The goal of our work is not to obtain state-of-the-art performance on each fine-tuning task, but to understand the effectiveness of each hyperparameter for fine-tuning, avoiding unnecessary computation.
 In a similar manner, we propose the Plug and Play Language Model (PPLM) for conditional language generation that combines one or more simple attribute models p(a|x)—either in the form of a bagof-words (BoW) or single layer classifiers—with a pre-trained, unconditional language model p(x).
 The proposed model uses an explicit 3D consistency loss for the generated images; the model generates two RGBD images with different camera parameters and learns them to be consistent with the 3D world.
The empirical performance of this baseline, should not be understood as us suggesting that this is the right way of performing few-shot learning.
 We conjecture that this is because the contrastive objective better transfers all the information in the teacher’s representation, rather than only transferring knowledge about conditionally independent output class probabilities.
 Specifically, we learn a noise generator for each layer features of the main network, given lower layer features as input.
 On the other hand, post-processing methods adjust the output of a trained classifier to remove discrimination while maintaining high classification accuracy Fish et al., (2016); Dwork et al., (2018); Woodworth et al., (2017).
 We only need T cells to be crudely annotated in both datasets, which is reasonable; we don’t need to know that a particular T cell should be mapped to another specific T cell.
 Finally, the network with the highest potential is selected as a student and trained through the distillation method of attention transfer (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2017) with the original teacher.
In this study, we trained more than 10,000 models over two image classification datasets, namely, CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2014) and Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Netzer et al., (2011).
 Ko et al., (2019) proposed a gradient descent based approach to find linear bounds, however it is inefficient and poses a computational challenge for Transformer verification since self-attention is the core of Transformers.
PointNetSeg is a network used often for point cloud segmentation (e.g, in Qi et al., (2017)).
 The communication restricted setting, where the synchronization time is much higher than the gradient computation time.
Precautions with generative models have been addressed before, for example, unpaired image to image translation can hallucinate features in medical images (Cohen et al., 2018).
 We further provide new perspectives using VSP to understand phenomena that have not been clearly explained or that we have misunderstood (Section 4 and 5).
 In GCNs, the message passing between adjacent nodes is conducted along edge paths.
 The main contribution of the proposed work can be summarized as follows:
 This allows for a better trade-off between computation cost and accuracy than previous work.
Our main contributions are as follows:
 Our proposed method greatly improves upon the state-of-the-art system in this field.
The key idea of our approach (Figure 1) is to learn a neural network that, conditioned on the input graph to be optimized, directs an existing optimization algorithm’s search such that it finds a better solution in the same search budget.
 These long-term goals are used to generate short-term goals for the local policy (using a geometric path-planner).
 Recent studies have also observed that these quantized models demonstrate higher robustness to adversarial attacks (Galloway et al., (2017); Siraj Rakin et al., (2018); Panda et al., (2019)).
 Such properties include localized, atrous, and deformable convolutions in G-CNNs by means of respectively localized, sparse and non-uniform B-splines.
 Our results suggest that depth and the total number of parameters of B-BERT are crucial for both monolingual and cross-lingual performance, whereas multi-head attention is not a significant factor.
 In experiments on 3D-room scenes and Atari game scenes, we quantitatively and qualitatively compare the representation of SPACE to other models and show that SPACE combines the benefits of both approaches in addition to significant speed-ups due to the parallel foreground processing.
 In this paper, we propose a single-node embedding for directed graphs to the space of probability distributions, described with the geometry of statistical manifold theory.
 This connects known results on MPC stability (Limon et al., 2003; 2009) and on infinite-horizon optimality (Scokaert & Rawlings, 1998) to imitation learning (Osa et al., 2018).
 Both ρ and δ only affect the asymptotically smaller second term.
The contributions of this paper are the following:
Strikingly, this behavior is confirmed both for our quadratic encoding, but also for relative encoding that is learned.
 In addition, we propose an ad-hoc improvement of EMP, whose theoretical analysis is left for future studies.
 This language is rich enough to represent many previously reported hand-designed exploration algorithms.
Learning from a small number of demonstrations under highly variable initial conditions is not straight-forward.
 The situation is similar in gradient based meta-learning methods (Finn et al., 2017; Ravi & Larochelle, 2016; Li et al., 2017b; Nichol et al., 2018; Flennerhag et al., 2019) and many other meta-learning methods (Vinyals et al., 2016; Snell et al., 2017; Gidaris & Komodakis, 2018), where the mechanisms used to generate the task-specific parameters rely on groundtruth labels, thus, there is no place for the unlabeled set to contribute.
 We show that current methods allow information to leak between the representations leading to imperfect disentanglement.
In summary, our contributions are as follows:
Inspired by the recent works on multi-task and few-shot RL, we propose a meta reinforcement learning approach that explicitly infers the latent structure of the task (e.g, subtask graph).
 Unfortunately, we cannot directly compute the hidden reconstruction as in the computation of the ordinary reconstruction because the autoencoder does not impose any correspondence between encoding-decoding pairs of hidden layers during the training.
 This inherently takes advantage of the fundamental flow phenomena in evolving and separating Lagrangian features non-linearly (see Figure 1).
 For each atomic block, a penalty term in proportion to its FLOPs is enforced on its importance factor; effectively, the penalty makes AtomNAS favor atomic blocks with less FLOPs.
 This limits its application to the general-purpose estimation, since the underlying distributions are often unknown.
 For machine translation, on IWSLT 2014 German-English, it outperforms the transformer by 3.1 BLEU under 100M Mult-Adds; on WMT 2014 English-German, it surpasses the transformer by 0.4 BLEU under 500M Mult-Adds and 1.2 BLEU under 100M Mult-Adds; on WMT 2014 English-French, it also achieves consistent improvements over the transformer: 1.2 BLEU under 500M Mult-Adds and 1.7 BLEU under 100M Mult-Adds.
 But for many functions of interest these quantities are not well-defined classically.
 First, previously learned knowledge should be transferred and combined with new knowledge.
 Compared with ordinary behavior cloning, this VAE-based next state predictor can advise the imitator to return to the demonstration trajectory when it deviates.
 Different from prior deep segmentation work that learns point features for segmentation mask prediction, our formulation essentially learns part-level features.
 This indicates that deep learning models can easily be fooled by certain large scale patterns.
This technique is simple to use and surprisingly effective.
Rounding out the organization of this paper: this introduction will state the main summarizing result and its intuition, and then close with related work; Section 4 will describe certain odds and ends for approximating continuous functions which were left out from the main tools in Section 2 and Section 3; Section 5 sketches abstract approaches to constructing transport mappings, including ones based on a corresponding Hilbert space; Section 6 will conclude with open problems and related discussion.
In this paper, we propose a model called SCALable Sequential Object-Oriented Representation (SCALOR).
 Our approach allows for a utility-preserving defense, as well as trading-off a marginal utility cost to significantly degrade attacker’s performance.
 Consequently, it does not react equally to all possible input transformations encountered in visual data, even if they belong to the same transformation group (e.g, in-plane rotations).
 However, such methods have a high computational complexity as the bitwidth policy must be learned, which involves training many quantized DNNs.
 In this paper, we show that the bias due to non-uniform negative sampling can be easily removed at test time.
 Microsoft Research Cambridge; 2.
 But they proved the bound only for linear deep neural networks.
The first step of our attack is launching a cache side-channel attack, Flush+Reload (Yarom & Falkner, 2014), to extract a single trace of victim’s function calls (Section 3).
 We use ANN-SNN conversion as an initialization step followed by spike-based backpropagation incremental training (that converges to optimal accuracy with few epochs due to the precursory initialization).
The main contributions of this paper are:
 At the core of our method lies in a linear model that builds on gradients of model parameters as the feature representation.
Recent years have seen a surge of interest in network pruning techniques, many of which induce sparsity by pushing neuron weights or outputs to zeros, allowing them to be pruned without a detrimental impact on the task accuracies.
 That said, there probably exists a requirement of gains in the code estimations.
 Different from the Markov process case, which is linear, the existence of intermediate non-linear functions complicates the analysis.
 A recent work introduced Deep Infomax, a method that maximizes the mutual information content between the input data and the learned representation Hjelm et al., (2018).
 In particular, SGM utilizes a decay factor to reduce gradients from the residual modules.
 As a result, during the training stage, the metric function may overfit to the feature distributions encoded only from the seen domains and thus fail to generalize to unseen domains.
In this paper, we focus on selective synaptic plasticity to preserve learned representations in a deep neural network.
 To utilize a DoS system realistically would therefore require an accurate prediction model using the features available at shipment entry to the warehouse.
For AC-GNNs, a meaningful starting point to measure their expressive power is the logic FOC2, the two variable fragment of first order predicate logic extended with counting quantifiers of the form ∃≥Nϕ, which state that there are at least N nodes satisfying formula ϕ (Cai et al., 1992).
 This has restricted their development and caused their performance to lag behind unsupervised neural objectives on complex tasks.
 There has been much success in leveraging multi-agent autocurricula to solve multi-player games, both in classic discrete games such as Backgammon (Tesauro, 1995) and Go (Silver et al., 2017), as well as in continuous real-time domains such as Dota (OpenAI, 2018) and Starcraft (Vinyals et al., 2019).
 In NAS-Bench-201, we choose 4 nodes and 5 representative operation candidates for the operation set, which generates a total search space of 15,625 cells/architectures.
In our systematic study, we show that pre-training GNNs does not always help.
Slot-filling Consider a slot-filling task on restaurant reviews over labels like cuisine, location, and time.
 To measure how “simple” the trained model is, one of the most promising approaches currently investigated is the compression bounds (Arora et al., 2018; Baykal et al., 2019; Suzuki et al., 2018).
 The dynamical stability approach was used in (Nar & Sastry, 2018; Wu et al., 2018), to study which minima are accessible under a specific choice of optimization algorithm and hyperparameters.
In summary, our work makes the following contributions:
 Unfortunately, it is difficult to actually learn these sparse factorizations, because it requires finding the sparsity patterns of the factors—a discrete, nondifferentiable search problem.
 However, we find that regularization which encourages high-rank weight matrices often outperforms that which promotes low-rank matrices.
 The MPNNs with such aggregation are inclined to learn similar representations for proximal nodes in a graph.
 Khaled et al., (2019); Yu et al., (2019); Wang et al., (2019) made the latter assumption, while Zhou and Cong (2017); Stich (2018); Wang and Joshi (2018); Woodworth et al., (2018) made both assumptions.
 For instance, an armchair might be mistaken with a deckchair, but it should usually not be mistaken for a mushroom.
 In practice, this strategy often results in exhaustive search to make a verification decision.
 Code is available at: https://github.
 Without a rigorous understanding of the full impact of code-level optimizations, we cannot hope to gain any reliable insight from comparing algorithms on benchmark tasks.
In summary, in the presence of more complex structured output (i.g,, pseudoknots), it is challenging for energy-based approaches to simultaneously take into account the complex constraints while being efficient.
 Splitting activations in fact only affects the implementation; it is numerically identical to the layers used in the Transformer.
 For example, in the continuous GOL used in this paper as a testbed, initialization consists in determining the values of a real-valued, high-dimensional 256×256 matrix besides 7 additional dynamics parameters.
 First, we calculated the Sensitivity-n metric proposed by Ancona et al., (2018).
 The agreement-based aggregation described just now is termed ’routing’.
 This elimination not only reduces the cost for data collection, but also includes more diverse data to train a robust model.
To optimize those constraints, we introduce a variant of standard SGD method (Robbins & Monro, 1985) called constraint-aware stochastic gradient descent, which batches data points involved in the same constraint component together and dynamically adjust the constraints’ weights as a function of their satisfiability.
 The main contributions of this article are summarized below.
 As in BOGs, we perform inverse projections of observations and dynamically resample the map to take into account ego-motion.
 Unlike (Song et al., 2018; Carlini & Wagner, 2016; Zhao et al., 2018b; Goodfellow et al., 2014b) that resort to a costly search of adversarial examples, our algorithm is efficient and end-to-end.
 When a dataset is clean, it achieves faster convergence and better performance to emphasise on harder examples because they own larger gradient magnitude, which means more information and a larger update step for model’s parameters.
However, despite its popularity, the literature lacks, to our knowledge, a systematic analysis of the impact of data augmentation on convolutional neural networks compared to explicit regularization.
 In experiments, we were able to scale up the stochastic depth and width of neural networks, training deep stochastic residual networks with up to 80 deterministic and 11 stochastic layers with little difficulty.
 It features better representing the similarity relationship between data points, which is proved by the higher accuracy in our clustering experiments.
We evaluated the proposed method on five different real-world datasets in various application domains and demonstrated the effectiveness of GMLP compared to state-of-the-art methods in the literature.
 RL-LIM efficiently utilizes the small representational capacity of locally interpretable models by training with a small number of samples that are determined to have the highest value contribution to the fitting of a locally interpretable model.
 DVRL determines a reward by quantifying the performance on a small validation set, and uses it as a reinforcement signal to learn the likelihood of each datum being using in training of the predictor model.
 And the number of intervals represents the number of layers that make up a block.
Instead, we propose a new learning-to-learn (L2L) framework that provides a more principled and efficient way for adversarial training.
 Based on reliable prototype-based conditional information, we align both the instance feature representations and the class prototypes through the proposed PAAL scheme to relieve the alignment among semantically dissimilar instances.
 The states of interest and the context states are given by the user before training the model.
 However, even under such an assumption, only a memory and computationally expensive (expensive due to two-stage network linearization), closed-form approximate surrogate for network expected predictions exists (Bibi et al., 2018).
 In particular, Webb et al., (2018) presents a statistical approach to assessing robustness of neural networks.
 They reported many highly selective units that they characterized as ‘object detectors’ in both networks.
 On the strength of the event-based cameras, diverse event-based datasets were acquired such as Poker-DVS, MNIST-DVS (Serrano-Gotarredona & Linares-Barranco, 2015) and CIFAR10-DVS (Wu et al., 2019).
 The latter paper studies neural network convergence in the continuous limit of infinite width overparameterization, while the works of 3, 15, 27, 33, 36 analyze the finite width setting.
GraphSAGE naively assumes that unseen graph structure should be (easily) represented by known graphs data.
 Furthermore, with fine-tuning operations, it leads to our proposed method FALCON.
 The reweighted wake-sleep (RWS) algorithm (Bornschein & Bengio, 2015) optimises two separate objectives for θ and φ.
 Note that automatic channel pruning by DRL is a difficult task because the action space is usually very huge.
 It produces 73.9% mean IoU on the Cityscapes testing set with a speed of 73 FPS on a single GTX 1080Ti card.
 And existing few works are tailored for and limited to few specific loss functions and activation functions: Zeng et al., proved that the ADMM is convergent for square loss function and twice differentiable activation functions (e.g, sigmoid) (Zeng et al., (2019)); Wang et al., proved the convergence of ADMM for the Relu activation function (Wang et al., (2019)).
 We call this work s-Flow GAN since we embed Spatial information obtained from dense optical flow in a neural network as a prior for image generation and flow maps for video coherency.
 The latter layers of WaveGAN are replaced with the bandwidth extension modules, each of which is composed of the neural upsampling layer and encoder/decoder.
 This registration-at-the-loss mechanism enables more accurate feedback from the loss function into the fusion model, when comparing a super-resolved output to a ground truth high resolution image.
 This is enabled by jointly learning a transferable graph neural network along with the placement network.
 Surprisingly, we also found that there are isomorphic instances that have different target labels suggesting they are not suitable for learning a classifier at all.
 However, these common beliefs are insufficient to explain our empirical observations from a series of carefully-designed experiments in Section 4.
 Neural network tends to fit informative information, such as simple pattern, faster than non-informative and unwanted information such as noise.
Recently, Liu & Liu (2019) propose the AIGP method, which extends the idea of local inference to GP models with non-Gaussian likelihoods.
 We use geometric consistency losses to aid training, though no geometric information is used at inference time.
 Also, we demonstrate that, it is more effective while applying BNSR on the layer with more dissimilar distributions of the features.
 In Setting (ii), our method STR2 substitutes the gradient estimator in STR1 with one that integrates stochastic gradient and Hessian together to maintain an accurate gradient approximation.
To validate the superiority of our model, we experiment with it on three clinical risk prediction datasets against multiple baselines.
Given the gradients are well-behaved in the PreLN Transformer, it is natural to consider removing the learning rate warm-up stage during training.
 This result suggests that the optimization of AII, without the assumption of the optimality of qφ(a|z), does not need to maximize the conditional entropy, as the maximizing upper bound does not give any guarantees.
 Similar to Ammar et al., (2014); Song et al., (2016); Chen et al., (2018); Tirinzoni et al., (2018); Yu et al., (2019), our method assumes that the environment structure (state/action space) is identical between the source and target environments, while dynamics/kinematics parameters are different.
 In our work, we focus on retrieving the relative distances of simulated data sets.
 That the ycoordinate of a point is positive implies that GWM improves the test-performance.
 During inference, we only use the (shared) decoder, thus we do not add any computational cost.
 In addition, ensemble DP adversarial examples with a dynamic perturbation size µa are introduced into the training process to further improve the robustness of our mechanism under different attack algorithms.
 (2) Given the realization of the sequence of observations Yk, the aim of filtering problem is to compute the optimal estimate of xk conditioned on Yk.
 It seems a necessary task to design a model that has strong generalization ability to recognize real MEs images.
 We hypothesize that this is because a converged shallow net is an inadequate initialization for training deeper net, while random initialization can help to escape from a bad starting point.
 Designing a model with sufficient representational power to cover the hard instances, and meanwhile a finer-grained control to provide just necessary computation dynamically for instance of varying difficulty is therefore essential.
Our contributions are as follows.
 Our empirical observations on both CIFAR10 and ImageNet show that the number of training epochs required by MaskConvNet is close to training a baseline without pruning, mainly attributed to the fact that the mask module (1) enables threshold-free pruning, thanks to the hard Sigmoid activation function and (2) is shared within the bundled block structure (fig.  1) which in turn addresses the mismatch problem between CONV and BN layers.
 Instead of modelling the dynamic OD networks as a sequence of images and applying standard convolution filters to capture their spatial information, we introduce a novel Vertex Adjacent Convolution Network (VACN) that uses an irregular convolution filter to cover the most related OD flows that share common vertecies with the target one.
 Our experimental results also show that combining actor-critic algorithms (such as A2C, PPO) with our framework is more sample-efficient than their original versions.
Our contribution in this paper is threefold:
For clustering steaming data, we propose online Extreme Value k-means based on Mini Batch kmeans (Sculley, 2010).
 Taking motivation from our bound, we propose our meta-learning model (DIMCO) in Section 3.
 Finally, our experiments show that the proposed QGAN can quantize weights in GAN models into 1-bit or 2-bit representations while generating samples of comparable quality, and our multi-precision method helps to search a better quantization configuration according to a given demand.
 In other words, the generator depends on the training data sets, which are random samples from Dreal.
In this work, we study interpretable multi-aspect sentiment classification.

In this paper, our main contributions are:
 We introduce the Coordinatewise-Soft-Impute (CSI) algorithm for fitting the model and investigate its theoretical and practical properties.
 These two factors jointly determine synaptic plasticity.
We hypothesize that the real-world continuous control tasks also have a more complex optimal Qfunction and a policy than the dynamics.
 Our approach is also inspired by the standard training paradigm in visual recognition of first pretraining on a proxy task, either large supervised datasets (e.g, ImageNet) (Krizhevsky et al., (2012); Sun et al., (2017); Mahajan et al., (2018)) or unsupervised tasks (e.g, Doersch et al., (2015); Noroozi & Favaro (2016)), and then fine-tuning (transfer learning) on the desired task.
This paper introduces three main contributions:
 The network parameters are determined by the optimization of a cost function such that the optimal solution satisfies the PDE, boundary conditions and initial conditions.
The main contributions of this paper are two fold.
 An interesting intuitive observation is that a large learning rate can escape narrow minimas easily (as the optimizer can jump out of them with large steps), however once it reaches a wide minima, it is likely to get stuck in it (if the “width” of the wide minima is large compared to the step size).
 Especially, the uniform node sampling can approximate the exact embedding and its gradients within O( 1ε2L (log 1ε + log 1 δ ) L−1 log 1δ ) time, where L denotes thenumber of layers.
 Our novelty includes:
Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
 In this work, we show this is caused by error in gradient estimation during training of NODE, and propose a memory-efficient framework for accurate gradient estimation.
 It is generally believed that increasing the number of heads helps by allowing the heads to compute context from different representation subspaces at different positions.
Our key contributions are
 Therefore, in this work we focus on generating representations of molecules where the 3-D information is essential for reconstruction.
 Then, we propose a novel two-stage learning framework including the general distillation and the task-specific distillation.
 This poses a roadblock when using a meta neural network to predict the accuracies of neural architectures, since graph structures are difficult for neural networks to understand directly from the adjacency matrix (Zhou et al., 2018).
 The framework is general and works in both the supervised and unsupervised settings.
 This corresponds to decreasing the variance of the observational noise of the generative model at each pixel, where we are assuming the data distribution is factorial Gaussian conditioned on the output of the decoder, which yields the MSE as the reconstruction loss.
 An embedded latent space is constructed where the learned style vectors could be combined to obtain novel style feature.
 The second requirement is the maintenance of more details of the spatial structure, which can improve the matching accuracy of many small structures, such as railings, chains, traffic signs and so on.
 Regarding data scalability, we apply a novel graph attention mechanism that simply extends the attention mechanism used in natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017) to graphs.
 With the emergence of deep learning, the reinterpretation of some existing mechanisms such as dropout, or the proposal of stochastic mechanisms such as Montecarlo approaches, has broadened the use of these techniques for accounting for uncertainty in deep models (Gal, 2016).
 At the very end of the super-net training, training each child model in one mini-batch can make this model be the best performing one on the validation data.
When we set the horizontal dimension of hidden tensor L with r, each τ2-dimensional fiber in H, which is a vectorization of each (τ, τ)-patch of an input image, is encoded into r-dimensional space.

 In recent work (Kuleshov et al., 2018) suggested a definition based on credible intervals where if we take the p percentiles of each predicted distribution the output should fall below them for exactly p percent of the data.
 This fails for two reasons: (1) we do not wish to assume prior knowledge of the functional form of the dose-response curves and so will have access to the generated dose-response curves only by evaluating them at given points (and so "entire" dose-response curves cannot be passed to the discriminator); (2) substituting the generator output for the factual treatment-dosage pair with the factual outcome will almost always create a discontinuity in the response curve and thus the factual treatment-dosage pair would be very easy to identify.
Our evaluation of document classification tasks on two real-world datasets shows that FURL has similar performance to the server-only approach while preserving user privacy.
 Finally, we compare our method with standard domain randomization and other regularization techniques in complex visual environments.

 Besides, the whole process is time-consuming, thus it is hard to generate a very large-scale dataset.
 Building on this result, we consider two different possible effects adversarial perturbations might have on the classifier:1.
 It reduces the time cost greatly and ensures the real-time performance at the same time.

 However, while the literature on competitive information diffusion focuses on the strategic seeding of a pre-determined diffusion process, our work focuses on modeling the information diffusion process itself through the agents’ learned actions.
While the interactions between the same thermostat model and different buildings correspond to different MDPs, these MDPs share regularities which can support generalization, such as the physics of heat diffusion.
In the case of semi-supervised learning methods, it was shown that if the unlabelled set is polluted with only 25% out-of-distribution examples, then using the unlabeled data actually has a negative effect on performance (Oliver et al., 2018).
 The problem with this approach is that for certain reads, we might not be able to accurately identify the species of the host organism, but nevertheless be interested in coarser taxonomic ranks.
 This allows the expected class probabilities based on the predicted Dirichlet distributions (i.g,, outputs of our trained Bayesian model) to match the predicted class probabilities of the deterministic GNN model, along with uncertainty estimated in the predictions.
 While this representation may allow them to yield state-of-the-art performance on test sets whose distribution is identical to the training set, they would perform poorly when the distribution of non-robust features shift.
 RandK-SGD even cannot converge on ImageNet.
 Employing a similar powerful competitive mechanism as demonstrated by Generative Adversarial Networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014), the discriminator enforces the embedding space of the model to follow the prior distribution.

 We show that the decoder network can then be used to synthesize images with modified semantic features.
 In other words, if the low level features extracted by the kth hidden layer can be readily used by the GLM layer, we should directly pass these features to the GLM rather than feeding them to the k + 1th hidden layer.
 Filters with the highest contributions were preserved, and the remaining filters were dropped from the network.

 In addition, though an image conveys rich information in internal structure, the conventional classifier-based methods are designed to learn a feature representation to simply infer a label, and any information not required to infer the label is omitted.
 If the perfect classifier exists in a given model class, the trade-off may be caused by the large sample complexity of adversarially robust generalization(Schmidt et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2018; Stutz et al., 2019).
 This argument has a very intuitive Bayesian reasoning: the signal that improves over its prior is more likely to be informative.
 The pseudo gradient is subsequently used to obtain the next update wt+1.
 However, by further decom-posing this activation (green point) along image A, that is to give the activation between the mouth region of image B and each position in image A, the resulting partial (or point-specific) activation map (green box) reveals that the mouth region of image B still has a high response on the mouth region of image A.

 Current work in natural language (NL) dataset augmentation with label preservation mainly relies either on back-translation (Shleifer (2019)), on synonym replacements (Kobayashi (2018)), on slot filling (Hou et al., (2018)) or on the use of handcrafted heuristics (Wei & Zou (2019)) (e.g swap, deletion, synonym replacements).

 MGLM models the joint distribution p(x1, . ,xk) over k channels.
1 See Appendix 1 for a review of real-world issues related to content recommendation.
 Specifically, this operation aggregates all neighbors’ information when making prediction for each node (sample) in a graph.
 The latter case then prompts FICM to generate high intrinsic rewards to encourage the agent for exploration.
 The intuition is that frames relevant to a word should have a higher measure of similarity as compared to the rest.
ML in quantum chemistry requires the availability of large datasets of chemical structures and their (measured or computed) chemical properties.
 Two latent space sampling strategies are investigated and compared.
 Our framework can be generally combined with various RL algorithms, improving the performance of RL algorithms in terms of safety.
 Repeatedly using the last update direction as a surrogate gradient will aggregate information about the gradient over time and results in improved gradient estimates.
 At execution time, the user can influence the behavior of the robot by simply talking to it.
 To further consider the clustered structure, we exploit the reweighted iterative soft-thresholding algorithm (RwISTA) (Fosson, 2018) as the prototype of our proposed network.
 We then adapt techniques for learning graphs from smooth signals (Kalofolias, 2016) to serve as graph regularization.
Since the above training process only considers maximizing the information gain of labeled data in the source domain, which is referred to ‘class information gain’, it does not resolve the domain misalignment problem between the source and target domain.
The shape x(i) is then used as input to the recurrent LSTM unit (light blue) which maintains an abstraction of a hidden state h(i−1).
The main contributions of this work are as follows.
 After the change, the system returns on the ‘mirrored’ path back to the original configuration — except for the permutation of one pair of indices.
 During the training process, the difference between the predictions from the collaboration network and the teacher network is taken into account of the loss.
 However, the word embeddings ignore the thematically contextualized structures (i.g,, document-level semantics), and can not deal with ambiguity.
Surprisingly, even though the training and testing environments are the same, we find that many of the conventional regularization techniques, when imposed to the policy networks, can still bring up the performance, sometimes significantly.
 This is true for a lot of existing datasets, e.g, Cityscapes does not contain anyclass labels for lane marking, which is crucial information for an autonomous vehicle.
 To the best of our knowledge, we firstly introduce the DT trick to GR-based CL problem.
 Importantly, such puzzles are objective – a candidate solution can easily be evaluated for correctness.
 We propose Reweighted Proximal Pruning (RPP), which integrates reweighted `1 minimization (Candes et al., 2008) with proximal algorithm (Parikh et al., 2014).
 In experiments, we show the above abilities of ROOTS on the 3D-Room dataset containing images of 3D rooms with several objects of differentcolors and shapes.
 We focus on the widely adopted synchronous update using data parallelism.
 Both the choice of a loss function and of a notion of solution is a modeling problem.
 Therefore, it is very necessary and important to develop a new analytical method to interpret the stability of layers.
 As the agent is able to observe multiple trajectories at a given state without actually executing multiple actions, the sample efficiency is greatly improved while the stochasticity of each state and action is implicitly learned.
 These informative relations can be used to construct an attribute affinity graph to smooth node features in a similar way as the node relations do, only in a different dimension.
 Unlike the foremost approaches including SDR and SSR that perturbs features to a specific reference point, we consider the minimum norm of perturbation to arbitrary directions, not just to a reference point, that can change model\\u2019s prediction, also known as \\u201cminimum adversarial perturbation\\u201d in the literature (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Weng et al., 2018b).
 This idea was first applied for generating 3D shapes in Gadelha et al., (2017).
 Beyond that, we also propose a method which remains completely in the unsupervised learning paradigm (without using an auxiliary dataset for supervised signal).
Despite the superior performance of these methods and their biological significance, choosing to store samples from previous tasks is challenging as a large working memory may be required (Lucic et al., (2017)).
 In Section 2 we prove that, if the classifier to be learned is linear, then evolution does indeed succeed in creating a neural network that classifies well, almost certainly and within polynomial (in the dimension of the problem) number of generations, individuals per generation, and neurons per individual.
 Arora et al., (2019b) further gave a finer characterization of error convergence based on the eigenvalues of NTK’s Gram matrix.
 In the presence of label noise, the loss is lower bounded by the label variance.
The contributions of this paper are as follows:
 We call these partitions Qj ⊂ RD, the vector quantization (VQ) regions of the network, and for x ∈ RD we let Q(x) denote the VQ region to which x belongs.
 The average reward can be regarded as an estimation of the quality of states to guide the exploring direction, but there are no methods using the quality of states as an exploration technique.
 We also introduced an inference framework for generating these labels at first place.
 In some sense, value-based modelfree methods can be seen as reward prediction models.
 Finally, we additionally train an unconditioned exploitation policy to utilize samples collected by the goal-conditionedexploration policy with environment-specific rewards.
 Our contributions are summarized as follows.
 Our framework outperforms all the other state-ofthe-art (SOTA) multi-task methods.
The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
 Based on a neural-network architecture, it jointly embeds the considered energy form and an associated interpolation scheme.
 We show theoretically in 3.2 and empirically in our results (see Table 2) that a fixed update routine does hinder generalization performance.
 Furthermore, theoretical understanding of the adaptation employed in LARS is largely missing.
 Note that this is different from just a mere combination of semi-supervised techniques with a noisy label filtering method.
In particular, to achieve the first goal, we explore two different means to either construct a syntaxbased static graph or a semantics-aware dynamic graph from the text sequence, as well as its rich hidden structure information.
 We show an empirical evidence of the consequence of our bounds by means of a variant of FittedQ-Iteration (FQI) (Ernst et al., 2005), based on our shared network and for which our bounds apply, that we call Multi FittedQ-Iteration (MFQI).
 To our best knowledge, there is no deep graph matching method explicitly incorporating edge attributes.
 Inspired by the recent meta-learning strategy (Finn et al., 2017), we learn to infer the structure relations from a training set to a validation set, which can benefit the generalization capability of the learned model.
 We call this method soft Q imitation learning (SQIL).
 Only one network is kept in the inference stage without requiring any additional computational or memory cost.
 The comparison is done using robust rank statistics, by testing if two images share the same subset of k maximally activated representation components.
The overestimation bias also appears in the actor-critic setting (Fujimoto et al., 2018; Haarnoja et al., 2018).
 Comparing to other sparsity-inducing regularizers, Hoyer regularizer achieves superior performance in the fields of non-negative matrix factorization (Hoyer, 2004), sparse reconstruction (Esser et al., 2013; Tran et al., 2018) and blend deconvolution (Krishnan et al., 2011; Repetti et al., 2015).
 We show that the difference in ranking negatively impacts the search phase of NAS algorithms, thus seriously impeding their robustness and performance.
 This is useful when we already know how to choose α.
 We also do not need to know how many tasks to train in advance and can always train on additional tasks when needed.
 In a grid graph, the two neighborhoods are within a parallel shift of each other.
 As such, the computation can be eased and become stable.
 After constructing the meta-knowledge graph, when a new task comes in, the prototype-based relational graph of the new task taps into the meta-knowledge graph for acquiring the most relevant knowledge, which further enhances the task representation and facilitates its training process.
 Theoretically, our algorithm is convergent if the variational decoder approximates the model well.
 The value range of these numbers is wide, resulting in overflows of thelow bitwidth accumulators.
 We organize the dataset into non-empty bags, where each bag is a subset of individual instances from this dataset.
 First, APD will largely alleviate catastrophic forgetting, since learning on later tasks will have no effect on the task-adaptive parameters for the previous tasks, and will update the task-shared parameters only with generic knowledge.
 This optimizes the tradeoff between mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving task transfer.
 Our algorithm is the first machine learning framework that outperforms LKH3 on CVRP, both in computation time and solution quality.
 The HLC chooses a QBN for each activation layer and generates a goal, the average QBN for all weight kernels of a convolutional layer, for each layer.
 The planning can also be solved under the PGM framework.
The structure of this paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 discusses the motivation behind this work and the synthetic construction to abstract certain observation effects.
With these observations, we propose a simple method to improve existing transformation-based defenses, as illustrated in Figure 1.
 Powers-of-Two quantization levels (Miyashita et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2017) are then proposed because of its cheap multiplication implemented by shift operations on hardware, and super high resolution around the mean.
 Usually, consistent components (x̂A, x̂B) represent common and reliable knowledge.
 We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm using synthetic and real data, and compare to classical computer graphics and learned approaches.
 For example, the ”There are ...” in Figure 1 requires verifying three QA pairs (total count=5, democratic count=2, republic count=3).
 In the context of MAML, the notions of “exploration” and “task identification” have thus been shifted to the parameter space instead of the action space.
 When combined with visual model predictive control, we observe that this subgoal optimization naturally identifies semantically meaningful states in a long horizon tasks as subgoals, and that when using these subgoals during planning, we achieve significantly higher success rates on long horizon, multi-stage visual tasks.
 GNNs are notorious for their poor scalability.
 There are two basic mechanisms for robustness improving under the MI operation (detailed in Sec.3.2.1), which can be illustrated by simple geometric intuition in fig. 1(c).
 However, since the class centers are updated w.r.t. the learned features during training, the center loss has to be jointly used with the SCE loss to seek for a trade-off between inter-class dispersion and intra-class compactness.
Once incremental learning has been defined and characterized for the toy model, we generalize our results theoretically and empirically for larger linear and quadratic models.
 To see how, consider that an agent tasked with reversing the arrow of time (by creating order from disorder) must in general learn complex skills to achieve its goal.
 We then create heatmaps over the videos with the “iNNvestigate” toolbox (Alber et al., (2018)) which highlight the areas that our CNN pays attention to when making a prediction.
Our analysis relies on the following assumptions: Assumption 1: Unconfoundedness (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) – There are no unobserved confounders (i.g,, covariates that contribute to both treatment selection procedure as well as determination of outcomes).
Conquering Mode Collapse/Mixture However, according to Brenier (1987; 1991a) theorem, the optimal transport map can be represented as the gradient map of the Brenier potential.
The architecture of our deep reinforcement learning agent largely follows (Zambaldi et al., 2019) and the details are given in Section 4.
Despite the individual advances in LNL and SSL, their connection has been underexplored.
 Yet they did not pay sufficient attention to misclassified examples.
 Our key theoretical result shows that MaSS has accelerated convergence rate over SGD.
 Our finding is that this is unlikely to change with the addition of more data.
 We found that unsupervised training with supervised validation enables reliable learning of disentangled representations.
The proof of the result relies on a geometric understanding of prediction surfaces of ReLU networks.
 To do so, we introduce a widely-applicable OOD score for individual inputs that corresponds, conceptually, to a likelihoodratio test statistic.
 For inference, the new predictor is used for all domains, which is sometimes undesired as the new predictor is trained with only the last domain.
 We find that selfattention strongly mixes context and token contributions.
 On the other hand, we are inspired by the recent research into understanding deep neural networks (Nguyen & Hein, 2017; Li et al., 2018; Soudry & Hoffer, 2017).
 Bottom: Our model identifies key words for unseen classes.
 2 We follow these related works for the goal and aim at showing the benefit of the use of the momentum in reaching an ( , )-second-order stationary point.
environments are substantially more vulnerable to adversarial policies than in lower-dimensional Ant environments.
 VideoFlow also produces excellent qualitative results, and avoids many of the common artifacts of models that use pixel-level mean-squared-error for training (e.g, blurry predictions), without the challenges associated with training adversarial models.
 The optimal pruning decisions are provided on-the-fly, and alleviate the exponential complexity of GSTs.
 On three of the QA datasets, our pretrained model outperforms all previous methods that do not rely on memory-consuming inter-passage normalizations1.
 NCF can also be used to generate useful representations of programs for indirectly related downstream tasks, and we demonstrate this transfer learning approach on an algorithm classification problem.
 It should be noted that in traditional GAN, the target distribution is identical to the training data distribution; however, in the DSGAN these two distributions, are considered to be different.
 It is also observed in practice for learning deep neural networks (Li & Yuan, 2017; Kleinberg et al., 2018).
 A discussion of these desiderata, as well as a detailed implementation of our approach is provided in Section 4.
 2) many of the resultant attacks resemble members of the target class and so cease to be “adversarial” – i.g,, they may also be misclassified by humans.
 We used PGD attack (Madry et al., 2017) to solve the optimization problem, and obtained competitive generative modeling results on CIFAR10, ImageNet, and synthetic datasets.
 We highlight our contribution as:
We note that there have been a number of earlier works on using generators to produce adversarial perturbations in the white-box setting (Baluja & Fischer, 2018; Xiao et al., 2018; Wang & Yu, 2019).
 The set of model-dependent images selected by MAD are the most informative in discriminating the competing classifiers.
 See also (Strehl & Littman, 2008) for further discussions regarding this issue.
 We prove their exponential convergence in a general framework that includes the ALISTA (Liu et al., 2019) algorithm.
Similar to our approach, Baykal et al., (2018) used coresets for model compression.
 The nonlinearities in the piecewise linear activations partition the loss surface of any nonlinear neural network into multiple smooth and multilinear open cells.
 However, an optimal value of s is hard to specify without enough prior knowledge.
 However, this selection is not considered from the influence of each action on other agents.
 For example, instead of predicting the pose, it can be extracted from an existing video.
 Our certified radius is the unique solution to an equation, which depends on σ, pl, and the k largest probabilities pi’s (excluding pl).
 Greedy agents always pick the action with the largest Q-value estimate and will select the same action forever, failingto explore the alternative.
 The content features of a word / an RoI are domain specific (WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al., 2016) as word features, Fast R-CNN (Girshick, 2015) features for RoIs).
 This can directly adapt ERF while leaving receptive field untouched.
 Here, the goal is to extract as much information as possible from an ensemble of models and retain it within a single, possibly simpler, model.
 In Section 4.
 We introduce the novel concept of intrinsic disentanglement to uncover the internal organization of networks, arguing that many interesting transformations are statistically dependent and are thus unlikely to be disentangled in the latent space.
 This is 20 problems more than LoopInvGen, the winner of the SyGus 2018 competition loop invariant track (Padhi & Millstein, 2017).
 Section 3 proposes this order learning.
 This phenomenon shows that current models can well capture the biases in the dataset but lack the ability to understand the text and reason based on connections between the lines.
 We also show that in the case the target is chosen a pairwise conditional random field with attractive potentials, this choice leads naturally to the Wasserstein divergence between posterior distributions over the latent space.
In summary, our contributions are as follows:
 The details about search space can be found in Sec.3.2.
 To this end, we add two domain-specific and structure-agnostic baselines, whose purpose is to disentangle the contribution of structural information from node features.
 Our bounds have linear dependency on depth which is more aligned with practical observations.
Our contributions:
More recently, Ho & Ermon (2016) propose a Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) method, which obtains significant performance gains over existing IL methods in imitating complex expert policies in large and high-dimensional environments.
 Our experiments on face recognition and speech recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack.
Contributions in this work are three-fold:
 Specifically, we update the actor parameter using policy gradient (Sutton et al., 2000) and natural policy gradient (Kakade, 2002; Peters and Schaal, 2008; Bhatnagar et al., 2009) and update the critic parameter using primal-dual gradient temporal difference (Sutton et al., 2009a;b).
 Such a representation enables us to apply powerful Boolean reasoning tools to the analysis of BNNs.
 An example of a complex program that was synthesized only by the property signatures method is shown in Listing 1.
 Our contributions are threefold:
 Thus, neither provides an object-centric generation mechanism that accounts for relationships between constituent parts of a scene, e.g, two physical objects cannot occupy the same location, prohibiting the component-wise generation of novel scenes and restricting the utility of these approaches.
 To empower a deterministic network with multi-mode image generation, we divide the network into a deterministic sub-model and a stochastic sub-model as shown in Figure 1, where standard convolutional layers and stochastic convolutional layers with filter generators are deployed, respectively.
 We further demonstrate an approach to increase model steerability by jointly optimizing the generator and latent direction, together with data augmentation on training images.
 Although class imbalance in segmentation datasets has been previously addressed in (Badrinarayanan et al., 2017; Chan et al., 2019; Sudre et al., 2017), among others, they try to solve a problem that arises from the data collection process.
 They employ finite differences, a zeroth-order optimization means, to estimate the gradient and then use it to design a gradient-based attack.
 Such budget-aware schedules have been proposed in previous work (Feyzmahdavian et al., 2016; Lian et al., 2017), but often for a fixed learning rate that depends on dataset statistics.
 Furthermore, as we discuss in Section 3, the technical proof in Korda and La (2015) regarding the convergence of VRTD also has technical errors so that their results do not correctly characterize the impact of variance reduction on TD learning.
 We call this stream-lined imitation learning algorithm ValueDICE.
 While standard methods for FL, such as FedAvg (McMahan et al., 2017), have inspired many works also concerning DP in a multi-user setup (Agarwal et al., 2018; Bhowmick et al., 2019; Geyer et al., 2018; McMahan et al., 2018; Truex et al., 2019), we are the first to consider task-global DP as a useful variation on standard DP settings.
 Here the scoring function f is based on token-matching between the two high-dimensional sparse vectors with TF-IDF token weights, and retrieval can be done in sublinear time using the inverted index.
 Our contributions are as follows:
 Exhaustive ablation experiments show that the combination of all three components is crucial for CM3’s overall high performance.
 The analysis reveals locally adaptive properties of the learned models, akin to existing nonlinear filtering algorithms.
 We show that BQNs trained using our sampling-free method have much better-calibrated uncertainty compared with the stateof-the-art Bootstrap ensemble of quantized neural networks (E-QNN) trained by Courbariaux et al., (2016).
 All workers then begin optimizing the model.
 Second, having a confidence set can be useful for reasoning about safety since they contain the true outcome with high probability.
 Our contributions are as follows:
 Specifically, Wong et al., (2018) proposes to transfer the architecture knowledge under a multi-task learning perspective, where the number of tasks is fixed during training phase, and it cannot do a fast adaption for a new task.
 The integral image method for WSNet is primarily designed for 1D CNNs where filters are intrinsically 1-dimensional and 1D convolution is performed.
 The experiments on MNIST (LeCun, 1998) and CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky, 2009) demonstrate the effectiveness of this local elasticity-based clustering algorithm.
 Likewise, for b.
 By contrast our approach, called MEMO, retains the full set of facts into memory, and then learns a linear projection paired with a powerful recurrent attention mechanism that enable greater flexibility in the use of these memories.
 The structure is defined by the boundaries of individual slot values.
 Whether or not system is in equilibrium, the integral form in Eq. 2 points to gradient attenuation as a fundamental issue.
 They play an important role in regularizing gradients of the model during BP.
 Our specific hypothesis is that sleep phase could aid in reducing a neural network’s susceptibility to adversarial attacks and to increase generalization performance by reducing the impact that imperceptible input changes can have on the task output.
 There are two main ingredients of our proof: (i) establishing restricted gradient bounds and a smoothness property; and (ii) proving that these properties hold along the optimization trajectory and further lead to global convergence.
 This efficient approach makes it possible to apply multivariate spatial point processes in many areas, including locationbased social networks and recommender systems with many users.
Contributions.
 We also carry out an additional experiment, where we incorporate robustness into an additional continuous RL algorithm called Stochastic Value Gradients (SVG) (Heess et al., 2015b).
 (b) Shows posterior distribution after learning Task 1.
 If the unbounded (convex) loss is employed in deep network models, this becomes more prominent.
 Unlike typical ensembles, BatchEnsemble is mini-batch friendly, where it is not only parallelizable across devices like typical ensembles but also parallelizable within a device.
In this work, we investigate feed-forward networks where the weights of all, expect the first, layers are constrained to positive values.
 The differences are particularly important since most of the physics-related dynamic equations (e.g, Navier–Stokes equations) handle differences of physical quantities in spatial and temporal space instead of using the quantities directly.
 We release an open source implementation based on ‘Craystack’, a Python package which we have written for general prototyping of lossless compression with ANS.
 This is exacerbated in contextual categorical sequence generation problems, where it is common for a sequence to contain quite a few tokens/actions, each of which is selected from a set of thousands of candidates.
 GANs are typically framed as minimax problems of the forminf θ sup ϕ J (µθ, ϕ), (1)where J is a loss function that takes a generator distribution µθ and discriminator ϕ, and θ ∈ Rp denotes the parameters of the generator.
 Specifically, the algorithm does not require that the off-policy data come from the stationary distribution, or that the behavior policy be known.
 However, we focused on the position and scale as these are quantities that can be evaluated, allowing us to measure quantitatively the effectiveness of our method.
 However, a large number of physical systems accommodate generalized coordinates which are non-Euclidean (e.g, angles), and such angle data is often obtained in the embedded form, i.g,, (cos q, sin q) instead of the coordinate (q) itself.
 (4)As the optimization is over the orthogonal group O(n;R), restricting the condition in equation 4 onto the orthogonal group yields a necessary condition for any critical point A:4PO(n;R)  (AY )◦3Y ∗  = A.
 Specifically, they capture the change in user locations as they reach out to an appliance to set it up or turn it on (e.g, put food in a microwave and turn it on).
 However fictitious play empirically converges much slower than CFR-based approaches.
 Together, these experiments support contextual alignment as an important task that provides useful insight into large multilingual pre-trained models.
 Then, instead of asking the user to manually produce the correct output, we generate additional candidate outputs (to ensure that the correct one is included) and our learned neural oracle automatically selects one of these outputs (the one it believes is correct) and adds it to the input specification I.
 We explain why certain hyperparameters work so well on certain datasets while fail on others, which can guide hyperparameter search for fine-tuning.
 We sample from the resulting combined model by following gradients in the latent representation space in a manner inspired by the approximate Metropolis-adjusted Langevin (MALA) (Roberts et al., 1996; Roberts & Rosenthal, 1998) sampler deployed in Nguyen et al., (2017).
 This training pipeline is simple yet effective for generating depth images without supervision and for disentangling a camera pose from the image content.
 Somewhat surprisingly, the contrastive objective even improves results on the originally proposed task of distilling knowledge about class probabilities, for example, compressing a large CIFAR100 network into a smaller one that performs almost as well.
 We refer to this meta-noise generator as metadropout that learns to regularize.
 The third category is the in-process approach that enforces fairness by either introducing constraints or adding a regularization term to the training procedure Zafar et al., (2017; 2015); Pérez-Suay et al., (2017); Bechavod & Ligett (2017); Berk et al., (2017); Agarwal et al., (2018); Celis et al., (2019); Donini et al., (2018); Rezaei et al., (2019); Kamishima et al., (2011); Zhang et al., (2018); Bechavod & Ligett (2017); Kearns et al., (2017); Menon & Williamson (2018); Alabi et al., (2018).
 This gives rises to the side information that we can leverage in our algorithm — a certain subset of points in dataset X should be mapped to another subset of points in dataset Y .
 Our method is illustrated in Figure 1.
 In order to create a wide range of generalization behaviors, we carefully varied hyperparameters that are believed to influence generalization.
 In contrast, we derive closed-form linear bounds that can be computed in O(1) complexity.
 One of the benefit of our result is that it provides a simple characterization of universal equivariant architectures that can be used in the network design process to guarantee universality.
 In this case the batch size of best efficiency is typically large, and is achieved by using partial computation (gradient accumulation) while waiting for communication.
 Furthermore, it was already noted in (Zhu et al., 2017) that the CycleGAN might admit multpiple solutions and that the issue of tint shift in image-to-image translation arises due to the fact that for a fixed input image x ∈ X multiple images y1, . ,yn ∈ Y with different tints might be equally plausible.
 Removing certain edges is making node connections more sparse, and hence avoiding over-smoothing to some extent when GCN goes very deep.
 The results indicate that differential privacy is able to eliminate almost all the false negatives, and achieve significantly improved overall utility, compared with the current state-of-the-art work DeepLog (Du et al., 2017).
 We choose the Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA (Gonçalves & Resende, 2011)) as the optimization algorithm after an extensive evaluation of several choices showed that it gives by far the best speed-vs-quality trade-off for our application.
 This local policy uses learning to directly map raw RGB images to actions that the agent should execute.
 However, the loss in information associated with the quantization process often makes these quantized models perform significantly worse than their fullprecision counterparts while classifying the original unperturbed inputs.
Although concepts described in this paper apply to arbitrary Lie groups, we here concentrate on the analysis of input data that lives on Rd and consider G-CNNs for affine groups G = Rd o Hthat are the semi-direct product of the translation group with a Lie group H .
 A single attention head B-BERT can already give satisfactory results.
The contributions of the paper are as follows.
 Up to this point, different probability distributions were used for different embedding purposes such as: (i) applications to word embedding 45; 56, knowledge graphs 20, attributed graphs 4 or (ii) generalized point embeddings with elliptical distributions 36, but not for low-dimensional embedding of directed graphs, characterized by the theory of statistical manifolds.
 Our results seem to suggest that localized convolution is the right inductive bias for the first few layers of an image classifying network.
 EMP is compared with both policy-aware and policy-agnostic methods in a set of continuous and discrete control tasks and shows significant improvement.
 We identify a key parameter of our algorithm, the demo-ratio, which controls the proportion of expert demonstrations vs agent experience in each training batch.
 We argue that this is a suboptimal choice, which may lead to overfitting when the labeled set is small and hinder the possibility of zero-shot learning (when the labeled set is not provided).
 We therefore introduce LORD, a novel method which carefully ensures no information leakage between the class and content representations.
 The agent learns its adaptation policy to collect as much information about the environment as possible in order to rapidly and accurately infer the unknown task structure.
 Nevertheless, we show that it can be computed by feeding a reconstructed input to the autoencoder again.
 In particular, we draw the idea of Lagrangian advection on an Eulerian reservoir from both the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method (Evans & Harlow, 1957) and the Fluid-Implicit-Particle (FLIP) method (Brackbill et al., 1987), which are wholly recognized as \\u2019PIC/FLIP\\u2019 in modeling large-scale flow phenomena in both computational fluids, solids, and even visual effects.
 By minimizing the combination of the original network loss and the total penalty on the weights, AtomNAS is able to learn both the parameters of the network and the weights of the atomic blocks.
 Alternatively, the Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE, Belghazi et al., (2018)) and the Jensen-Shannon MI estimator (JSD, Hjelm et al., (2019)) enable differentiable and tractable estimation of MI by training a discriminator to distinguish samples coming from the joint distribution or the product of the marginals.
 Further, with general techniques, our Lite Transformer can achieve 18.2× model size compression.
 Instead, in Definition 1, we use duality to rigorously define a semi-norm ‖f‖R that captures the essence of the above quantities and is well-defined (though possibly infinite) for any f in any dimension.
 Second, the learned model should resist catastrophic forgetting (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017b), where a model adapted to a new distribution no longer works on the original one.
 Therobustness benefits from VAE’s latent stochastic sampling; 3) Global State Alignment.
 Borrowing ideas from Reinforcement Learning (RL), we formalize the process as a contextual bandit problem and train a local grouping policy to iteratively pick a pair of most promising sub-parts for grouping.
 In addition to image classifiers, the proposed attack methods can be generalized to different machine learning tasks such as image captioning ( Karpathy & Fei-Fei (2015)).
 It is as well less computationally expensive than prior techniques.
 Proofs are sketched in the paper body, but details are deferred to the appendices.
 SCALOR resolves the aforementioned key limitations and hence can model complex videos with several tens of moving objects along with dynamic backgrounds, eventually making the model applicable to natural videos.
 As a practical benefit, the defense involves a single hyperparameter (perturbation utility budget) and can be used with minimal overhead to any classification model without retraining or modifications.
• The human visual system does not just encode familiarity to objects but seems to learn through experience the poses in which these objects customarily appear in the environment to assist and improve object recognition (Freire et al., 2000; Riesenhuber et al., 2004; Sinha et al., 2006).
In this paper, we will use the STE approach and show that the quantizer’s parameters, including the bitwidth, can be learned with gradient methods if a good parametrization is chosen.
The stucture of our paper reflects our main contributions as follows:
 ETH Zurich; 3.
 There are also some works about the generalization of recurrent neural networks (Zhang et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2019).
 This trace corresponds to the execution of specific network operations a DL framework performs, e.g, convolutions or batch-normalizations, while processing an input sample.
 Essentially, our hybrid approach of taking a converted SNN and incrementally training it using backpropagation yields improved energy-efficiency as well as higher accuracy than a model trained from scratch with only conversion or only spike-based backpropagation.
 Even though pruning methods present a solution to neuron/weight importance, unfortunately they do not provide an answer to the latter question, i.g,whether these neurons/weights are important to the target dataset.
 Second, regarding the optimization procedure of ISTA as to minimize an upper bound of its objective function at each step, we conjecture that the element-wise update of (L)ISTA normally “lags behind” the optimal solution, which suggests that it requires overshoots to reach the optimum, just like what has been suggested in fast ISTA (FISTA) (Beck & Teboulle, 2009) and learned FISTA (LFISTA) (Moreau & Bruna, 2017).
 We overcame this problem by leveraging the combination of the ReLU activation function (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and the positivity of eigenvectors of the Laplacian associated with the smallest positive eigenvalues.
 This method outperforms other methods on many unsupervised learning tasks.
 We find that this simple adjustment on the gradient flow can generate highly transferable adversarial examples, and the more skip connections in a network, the more transferable are the crafted attacks.
 To address the issue, we propose to integrate feature-wise transformation layer to modulate the feature activations with affine transformations into the feature encoder.
 Inspired by (Chaudhry et al., 2018), we take a geometric view and devise a new method for selective synaptic plasticity.
 Together with the conditional alignment of representations, this implies that we can simultaneously achieve equalized odds and accuracy parity.
However, even with the availability of modern high-powered predictive methods including Gradient Boosted Trees and Neural Networks, there has been no documented progress in employing DoS-based methods.
 Indeed, this choice of FOC2 is justified by a classical result due to Cai et al., (1992) establishing a tight connection between FOC2 and WL: two nodes in a graph are classified the same by the WL test if and only if they satisfy exactly the same unary FOC2 formulas.
 In particular, using a larger learning rate prior to reaching the break-even point reduces the spectral norm of K along the optimization trajectory (see fig.  1 for an illustration of this phenomenon).
 Both challenges allow for a parametric control over image variability.
 Luckily, in recent years, powerful variational approximation techniques have made it more practical to train probabilistic models without strong independence assumptions (Miao & Blunsom, 2016; Yin et al., 2018).
 Despite the impressive emergent complexity in these environments, the learned behavior is quite abstract and disembodied from the physical world.
 Each architecture is trained multiple times on three different datasets.
 Naïve pre-training strategies can lead to negative transfer on many downstream tasks.
 When an annotator sees an instance like: what chinese restaurants in this city have good reviews?, after labeling token chinese as cuisine, he generalizes it to a rule: (.
 These bounds measure how much the network can be compressed and characterize the size of the compressed network as the implicit effective dimensionality.
 In (Nar & Sastry, 2018), the authors analyzed gradient descent (GD) algorithm as a discrete-time nonlinear dynamical system.
 Thus, current methods for training sparse neural networks are either expensive (Frankle & Carbin, 2019) or rely on highly hand-tuned heuristics for evolving the sparsity patterns throughout training (Dettmers & Zettlemoyer, 2019).
 This indicates that low-rank structure is not a significant force behind generalization in practical networks.
 This implies that they are probably desirable methods for assortative graphs (e.g, citation networks (Kipf & Welling, 2017) and community networks (Chen et al., 2019)) where node homophily holds (i.g,, similar nodes are more likely to be proximal, and vice versa), but may be inappropriate to the disassortative graphs (Newman, 2002) where node homophily does not hold.
 The two assumptions violates the second and third characters of FL.
To alleviate the issue of the negative diversity ignorance, we add an extra Gaussian prior objective to augment the current MLE training with an extra Kullback–Leibler divergence loss term.
 On the other hand, hand designed heuristics often involve a trade-off between effectiveness and computational cost.
com/YyzHarry/SV-RLplanning problems can greatly benefit from such a scheme, where fewer samples (only sample around 20% of (s, a) pairs at each iteration) can achieve almost the same performance as the optimal policy.
Our results emphasize the importance of building RL methods in a modular manner.
 In this paper, we adopt a different viewpoint by assuming that the secondary structure is the output of a feed-forward function, i.g,, A\\u2217 = F\\u03b8(x), and propose to learn \\u03b8 from data in an end-to-end fashion.
 Applying reversible residuals instead of the standard ones does change the model but has a negligible effect on training in all configurations we experimented with.
 The possible variations of this matrix are too large for a simple random sampling to be efficient.
 Secondly, we quantified how well the object of interest was localized using bounding boxes and extend the degradation task proposed by Ancona et al., (2017).
 Multiple routing algorithms exist, for example dynamic routing (Sabour et al., 2017), EM-routing (Hinton et al., 2018), SVD-based routing (Bahadori, 2018), and routing based on a clustering-like objective function (Wang & Liu, 2018).
The proposed scoring function, beyond being a cost function for planning, can also be treated as an indicator of the existence of objects, which affect the evaluation of a trajectory.
 In the following sections, we show how to encode Multi-MNIST-Sudoku and Crystal-Structure-Phase-Mapping as DRNets, by properly defining the structure of the latent space, additional reasoning modules to model the problem constraints (prior knowledge), and the components of the objective function.
 However, in contrast to BOGs, our model does not require a handcrafted observation model and it learns semantics directly from interactions with the environment through reward.
The main contributions of our work are thus:
 However, when severe noise exists, as demonstrated in (Krueger et al., 2017; Arpit et al., 2017), DNNs learn simple meaningful patterns first before memorising abnormal ones.
 It is a common practice to train the models with both explicit regularization, typically weight decay and dropout, and data augmentation, assuming they all complement each other.
 We summarize FouST in Algorithm 1.
Our key contributions are as follows:
 Furthermore, we conducted ablation studies and comparisons to study different architectural and training factors as well as visualizations on MNIST and synthesized data.
 In order to select these highest-value instances, we train instance-wise weight estimators (modeled with deep neural networks) using a reinforcement signal that quantifies the fidelity metric (i.g, how well does the model approximate the black-box model predictions).
 In a wide range of use cases, including domain adaptation, corrupted sample discovery and robust learning, we demonstrate significant improvements compared to permutation-based strategies (such as Leave-one-out and Influence Function (Koh & Liang, 2017)) and game theory-based strategies (such as Data Shapley (Ghorbani & Zou, 2019)).
 If we map both combining (e.g, addition) and transformation (e.g, 3× 3 conv) to a node, and flow of features to an edge, then the architecture can be expressed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
 Specifically, we parameterize the optimizer of the inner maximization problem by a neural network denoted by g(A(x, y,θ);φ), where A(x, y,θ) denotes the input of the optimizer g.
 However, such a conditional domain alignment may promote the confusion among semantically similar instances across domains to some degree.
 The idea of our method is to encourage the agent to find skills that maximize the mutual information between the context states and the states of interest.
 Eventually, even if side information (i.g,, real-world user feedback) is unobservable, our algorithm is still applicable to synthesize feedback in both the training and inference phases.
 Contributions.
 As opposed to verification methods, which in many cases can be hard to scale, that provide a binary measure of robustness per sample, they propose to frame verification as a probability of violation instead.
 Similarly, Morcos et al., (2018) reported that CNNs trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet learned many highly selective hidden units, with CCMAS scores approaching the maximum of 1.0.
Embracing the event-based cameras and their derived datasets, a variety of monographs demonstrate the different methodologies whose intentions are to make a plausibility of the application of accordingly components.
 For finitewidth over-parameterized networks, the training evolution also exhibits a kernel that takes the form of a Gram matrix.
 We combine the ground truth structure and the learned dual-encoder to generate final representation.
 • Algorithm.
 Its gradients are approximated by self-normalised importance sampling with K particles: this induces a bias which vanishes as K → ∞.
 Specifically, the discrete action space for the DRL agent is as large as the number of channels at each layer, and the action spaces may vary among layers since there are different numbers of channels in different layers.
 Therefore, there lacks a unified theoretical framework which covers wide range of commonly used losses and activation functions.
 This optical flow is available since the simulated image is accessible at test time in the case of CG2real scheme.
 They progressively output (progressively trained too) the higher sampling rate audio.
 Otherwise, a MFSR model would naturally yield blurry outputs to compensate for the lack of registration, to correct for sub-pixel shifts and account for misalignments in the loss.
In this paper, we provide an alternative view: the magnitude of the learning rate is closely related to the complexity of learnable patterns.
 Similar phenomenon was observed in the inverse scale space theory for image restoration Scherzer & Groetsch (2001); Burger et al., (2006); Xu & Osher (2007); Shi & Osher (2008).
 They use directed graphical models to approximate both the prior and the posterior.
 Although our network is simple, it shows promising results compared to baselines which optimize for cycle-consistency without learned embeddings, using a matrix factorization loss (Zhou et al., 2015b; Leonardos et al., 2017).
 We further compare our proposed method with other normalization schemes, including Batch Normlization (BN), Layer Normlization (LN) and Instance Normlization (IN) on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets.
 As a result, STR2 achieves convergence in Õ(n3/4/ 1.5) overall stochastic first- and second-order oracle queries.
 The results show that our model obtains significant improvements over strong multi-task learning baselines.
 We conduct extensive experiments, including IWSLT14 German-English translation, WMT14 English-German translation, and BERT pre-training tasks.
 Empirical validations show that AII catastrophically fails to induce invariance even in satisfactory simple situations, as suggested by the above finding.
 This assumption holds in many real-world applications such as in sim-to-real tasks (Tan et al., 2018), industrial insertion tasks (Schoettler et al., 2019) (different dynamics comes from the differences in parts), and wearable robots (Zhang et al., 2017) (with users as dynamics).
 Hence, we do not aim for retrieving the absolute parameter change, but a relative distance that preserves ordering with respect to this parameter.
can see in the figure, the attachment of GWM reduces both train loss and test loss for all but three model-dataset pairs.
We benchmark our proposed method on the challenging Flickr30k Entities image captioning dataset (Plummer et al., 2015) and the ActivityNet-Entities video captioning dataset (Zhou et al., 2019) on both captioning and grounding performances.
 An end-to-end privacy analysis shows that, by slitting the private training data into disjoint and fixed batches across epochs, the privacy budget in our DPAL is not accumulated across training steps (Theorem 4).
This approach is unique compared with previous proximity graph algorithms, where most of them only exploit the structure of the underlying index instead of learning from query distribution to reshape proximity graphs.
Not surprisingly, recurrent neural network has been proposed to do filtering.
To improve the generalization ability, we decouple the feature extraction process and the translation process.
Motivated by this, we intentionally avoid full convergence during the growing by using (1) random initialization of new layers, (2) a constant large learning rate, and (3) a short growing interval.
In this paper, we propose ISBNet to address the aforementioned issue with its building block Cell as illustrated in Figure 1.
 • Budget-aware.
 The OD flows connected by common starting and/or ending vertexes, which may fall into different regions of the flow map, can be spatially correlated and topologically connected.
 When fit the GEV distribution, we use mini batch data as a block.
 In InfoCNF, we partition the latent code into two separate parts: class-specific supervised code and unsupervised code which is shared between different classes (see Figure 1).
 We put our analysis in the context of previous work in Section 4.
In summary, our work has following contributions:
 The training process minimizesd(D̂real,Dg), where D̂real denotes the empirical distribution over samples.
 We describe an architecture for predicting the sentiment of multiple aspects while generating a probabilistic (soft) multi-1In the rest of the paper, we will use the terms mask, justification and rationale interchangeably.
Moreover, most of models utilize words or character as the single input, but the multi-input model is well suited to text classification.
 The contribution of our work is threefold:
 As both factors are available at the synapses undergoing plasticity, it has been argued that learning schemes such as AGREL and AuGMEnT are indeed implemented in the brain (Roelfsema & Holtmaat, 2018).
 The theoretical analysis of the synthetic dynamics suggests that a model-based few-steps planner on top of a parameterizedQ-function will outperform the original Q-function because of the addtional expressivity introduced by the planning.
 Similarly, we propose to pretrain the encoder using a proxy task that encourages capturing style into a latent space.
 Chiaramonte & Kiener (2017) addressed the forward problem by constructing a one layer network which satisfies the PDE within the domain.
The above hypothesis motivates our Explore-Exploit scheme where we force the optimizer to first explore the landscape with a high learning rate for sometime in order to land in a wide minima.
 This complexity is completely independent of the number of nodes, edges, and neighbors of the input, which enables us to deal with graphs irrespective of their size.
 We demonstrate our framework for free-form ODEs generalizes to various model structures, and achieves high accuracy for both NODE and GODE in benchmark tasks.
 However, increasing the number of heads decreases the head size, decreasing the expressive power of individual heads.
 We then establish the convergenceof clipped gradient methods under the same condition and prove that they obtain theoretically optimal rates.
 Generating 3-D structures is still a relatively nascent field, when compared to image and text generation.
 At the general distillation stage, the original BERT without fine-tuning acts as the teacher model.
 We use a path-based encoding scheme to encode a neural architecture, which drastically improves the predictive accuracy of our meta neural network.
 Let us start with the supervised case.
 It is important to note that increasing this weight alone without access to a trainable prior does not consistently improve generation quality.
 A new subsequence is obtained by composing content and style freely from different reference subsequences.
 The existing feature extraction networks usually use a deep convolution neural network to obtain a larger receptive field and extract more abstract semantic information.
We make our models and code publicly available.
 This graph attention mechanism does not include sequentially dependent hidden states as the recurrent neural network (RNN) does, which improves the parallelizability of training significantly.
Uncertainty can be categorized into epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.
 Based on the insights, we further explore partial weight sharing, that is, each child model could selectively share weights with others, rather than all of them sharing the same copy of weights.
 Note that the volume of hidden tensor L looks to be larger than that of input/output image, but representation ability of L is much lower than input/output image space since the first/last tensor (H,H′) must have Hankel structure (i.g,, its representation ability is equivalent to image) and the hidden tensor L is reduced to lower dimensions from H.
 Therefore, we suggest that future GNN works should pay more attention to the unsupervised fashion as well as not comparing supervised models with unsupervised models together.
 Here, SplitLBI is a natural extension of SGD with structural sparsity exploration: SplitLBI reduces to the standard gradient descent method when the coupling regularization is weak, while it leads to a sparse mirror descent when the coupling is strong.
Formally, to boosting a network, we introduce a Growing and Training Network Algorithm (GT-Net Alg), consisting of two parts of growing both filters and layers, i.g,, Growing and Training filters algorithm (GT-filters Alg), and Growing and Training layers algorithm (GT-layers Alg).
 In fact, Continual Learning algorithms should be robust in the size of the batch of classes.

 We first observe that the f -divergence function between two properly defined distributions of the samples can serve the purpose of incentivizing truthful report of samples.
However, the existing theoretical utility guarantee for gradient perturbation is the same as or strictly inferior to that of other perturbation methods as shown in Table 1.
 Based on this definition the authors further suggested a calibration evaluation metric and re-calibration method.
 We argue it is more representative of the human level than the one used in most of previous works.
We overcome these two hurdles by defining a discriminator that, rather than acting on the entire dose-response curves, acts on a finite set of points from each curve, as shown in fig. 1.
 Besides, we conduct extensive experiments, which further show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art bandit algorithms in various settings.
 Learning user embeddings improves the performance significantly in both server training and FL.
 To motivate the present approach, we develop a general formulation of adversarial training as an optimal control problem, from which an approximate optimality criterion can be derived based on the Pontryagin’s maximum principle.
 Therefore, an end-to-end framework is proposed in this paper, which consists of two parts.
 They might cause the classifier to focus on the wrong pixel locations 2.
 The main message of that work is that, like η, momentum acceleration needs to be carefully selected based on properties of the objective, the data, and the underlying computational resources.
 Given the rapid pace of model development, this shows that our data subsets remain valuable even after a particular model is surpassed by newer architectures.
 It can be observed that compared to directly adding noise spatially, editing on different scales of the Laplacian pyramid leads to non-local random corruptions.
 Many of our insights confirm and extend recent findings from Bau et al., (2019).
 The decay rate of the approximation error of estimating the true distance with minibatches of size N is of order O(N−1/d) for the Wasserstein distances, where d is the dimension of the sample space (Weed & Bach, 2017).
The main contributions of this paper are summarized as:
In general, we improve two aspects in Mask R-CNN by proposing SA-FPN (Scale Aware Feature Pyramid Networks) and EJ-Head (Effective Joint Head).
 More cells to learn exacerbates the problem, and this is why MA is required, as for each agent the size of the search space is always constant.
 We achieve competitive performances for the detection of 4 kinds of adversarial attacks and 4 OOD datasets.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
 However, they require users to specify the number of data instances as the input to their approach.
 Our conditional architecture alleviates this problem, as the conditional inputs can be preprocessed by a conditioning network with a standard feed-forward architecture, which can be learned jointly with the cINN to greatly improve its generative capabilities.
Although 3D-GAN has been proved to be successful, it still has some problems.
 Févry & Phang (2018) adopts denoising autoencoders originally used in sentence compression.
 Arguably this also includes Bayesian approaches using variational methods (Farquhar & Gal, 2018; Achille et al., 2018) or Monte-Carlo dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2015) to estimate uncertainties.
 They are compared andbenchmarked against the ground truth value on the multivariate Gaussian distribution Locatello et al., (2018).
 This is different from previous VAE-based approaches that merely focus on objective function design where hyperparameter tuning is crucial.
 Furthermore, the convergence of the statespace actor remains unaffected by visual randomisation.
 The performance of this method is very heavily dependent on the cut selection process (see Dey & Molinaro (2018); Poirrier & Yu (2019) for deep discussions about the cut selection process).
 On the Character Font Images dataset of ⇠1.7M points, TriMap calculates the embedding in ⇠1.3 hours while LargeVis takes more than 3 hours and UMAP exceeds the 12 hours time limit.
 It is the feature space defined by φ where we measure robustness toward small perturbations.
• We open source all of our experimental code.
Deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (DMARL) has been applied to solve games of different structure.
In section 6, we further discuss the relations between BMRL and other existing formulations.
In the natural continual learning framework, where a model has to learn new concepts while not forgetting old ones, detecting when examples do not belong to any previously-learned class is a fundamental problem.
 This can apply in cases where little relevant reference data is available for a sequencing dataset (such as deep sea metagenomics data (Tully et al., 2018) or New York City metagenomics where only 48% of samples matched a known species (Afshinnekoo et al., 2015)), so a more accurate prediction at higher taxonomic ranks may be more informative for downstream analysis (Rojas-Carulla et al., 2019).
 This effect is not mitigated by a larger training set containing more variations between samples.
 Therefore, though existing studies show that TopK-SGD and RandK-SGD have the same convergence bound, their theoretical results cannot explain the performance gap between TopK-SGD and RandK-SGD.
In our ER-Classifier framework, the encoder and discriminator structures together project the input data to a low-dimensional space with a nice shape, then the classifier performs prediction based on the lowdimensional embedding.
 This method provides initialization for fast adaptation and automatically learns the divergence to optimize.
 In this paper, we ask how this overparameterization, and more specifically the architecture of a neural net, affects the dynamics of SGD.
 Finally, we also find UDA to be beneficial when there is a large amount of supervised data.
 Importantly, our theoretical results take into account the error in the estimate of the minimum objective value.

When searching over architectures, differences in resource use can be compared at different levels of granularity.
 In particular, we show that it suffices to execute adapted greedy policies to ensure −optimal behavior in the target domain.
 As one example of these potential new capabilities, we demonstrate the potential of semi-supervised learning in the Appendix, showing the potential benefits of information extraction from unlabeled data which non-deep learning models are much weaker at.
 This opens new territories for supporting stronger NAS algorithms and new possibilities for most expressive architectures ever to be revealed.
 Data augmentation techniques can also be safely applied to our model during training without deteriorating its generalization ability to unseen manipulations.
 Besides the aforementioned papers on the mean field analysis for neural networks, tools from stochastic analysis (Mandt et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017; 2019; Yaida, 2018; An et al., 2018) and Wasserstein geometry (Arjovsky et al., 2017; Cuturi, 2013; Frogner et al., 2019; Peyré et al., 2019; Solomon et al., 2014) have been playing an increasingly prominent role in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
 The design consists of finding new configurations with optimized pore locations, such that the resulting configurations have favorable thermal conductivity (i.g,, minimal κ) and desired mechanical stability (von Mises Stress σ ≤ τ , where τ is some preset threshold).
 We compare our method with state-of-the-art baselines for forecasting velocity fields up to 60 steps ahead given the history.
 Next, we give our main result, which is the derivation of our objective in Section 3.
 To understand the differences, we conduct a large-scale study comparing synthetic noise, namely blue-pilled noise (or Blue noise), and real-world noise (or Red noise1).
 Figures (b) and (c) show two methods of converting this ternary relation into three binary ones.
 This is the phenomenon whereby gradients are in some sense hidden or minimized, so that gradient-based attacks fail to produce adversarial examples.
 Gradients have been utilized in diverse applications such as adversarial attack generation and visualization (Zeiler & Fergus, 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2014).

 We also empirically show that model ensembling of models trained with our regularizer achieve higher certified accuracies.
Our approach led to some non-intuitive findings.
 For small datasets, which are common in the biomedical and clinical domains where it is particularly challenging to acquire labelled data, this can lead to poor performance and/or overfitting.
 The intuition behind compressive sensing is that if a signal (or function) can be represented via a sparse basis expansion, then it can be recovered (either exactly or approximately) from a small number ofrandomized measurements.
 It was shown in (Xu et al., 2019b;a) that an imperceptible adversarial perturbation to fool classifiers can lead to a significant change in a class-specific network interpretability map, e.g, CAM.
 We also propose a feature leveling scale to measure the complexity of different sets of features’ in an unambiguous manner rather than simply using vague terms such as ”low” and ”high” to describe these features.
 The pruned and unpruned filters are analyzed for correlation, overlap and other measures allowing us to determine class-wise interactions.
 In this paper, we propose an adversarial imitation training, which is a special two-player game.
 Our results show up to 10.9% improvement over the baselines.
 2) When the input length is longer then maximum sequence length of BERT, BERT-AL still can load the pretrained BERT model, which avoids pretraining much longer BERT model from scratch.
 However, the low quality of image makes former SR methods fail to generate applicable images.
 Here, we add alternative proxy decompositions for each target molecule by either 1) randomly removing bond types that can possibly break during reactions, or 2) transforming the target based on templates.
 This leads to our key insight.
 We use multiple generators as before, but instead of dividing up the noise space into factorized Gaussians and sending one to each generator, we let an additional neural network determine how best to divide up the noise space and dispatch it to each generator.
 To do this automatically, we implement a MCTS method which iterates through simulation, selection and back-propagation steps, to collect useful information that guides the sampling process.
 However, applying off-policy batch RL to language generation is challenging because the number of potential combinations of words and sentences leads to a combinatorial explosion in the size of the state space.
 However, the automatically generated sub-goals typically lack semantically meaningful senses, thus are difficult for humans to understand and hurts the overall system’s interpretability.

Toward finding (3), we measure changes to model sensitivity to both common image corruptions and natural adversarial examples using two open source robustness benchmarks: ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019) and ImageNet-A (Hendrycks et al., 2019).
 We present both theoretical derivations and practical solutions.
 The intuition here is that the sparsity of the transitions will bias the model towards learning primitive transformations (e.g, how pushing a box affects the state of a box being pushed etc) rather than configurationdependent transformations, the former being more directly transferable to environments with increased combinatorial complexity.
 This framework has a similar energy form as RBMs, though there is a non-probabilistic training procedure where the eigenvalue decomposition plays the role of normalization.
 In this paper, we propose a Conditional Query Learning (CQL) model that directly addresses the gap between sub-actions.
 Unseen attribute-object pair recognition is a high-level and complex vision problem relying on the deep and comprehensive understanding of an image, which asks a model to learn an intrinsic feature representation conveying the rich information of an image.
 Without sufficiently large amount of data, the empirical minimization of (1) may result in a large standard risk by converging to a model of a poor robust risk.
 Prelec et al., (2017) also argued that via eliciting a peer prediction information, which is defined as the fraction of “how many other people would agree with you” from each agent, he will be able to construct an informative prior to compare with the majority vote posterior aggregation.
 Very recently, there has been a trend of studies in proposing sampling the perturbed vectors from some non-isotropic Gaussian distributions (e.g, Maheswaranathan et al., (2019); Choromanski et al., (2019a); Ye et al., (2019)).
 This partial activation map can be generated for each pixel, which renders the point-to-point activation intensity representing the relationship between regions in both images, e.g, eye-to-nose or mouth-to-mouth.
GET is evaluated on USPTO-50K, a common benchmark dataset for retrosynthesis.
 Using LDA with r topics, Dawson and Kendziorski represent the i-th subject as a probability vector Wi ∈ 0, 1r specifying the subject’s membership in each of the r topics; then Wi’s are treated as the input covariates to the Cox model.
 This formulation introduces several properties: Distribution nature - the possible inference trajectories in graph, besides synchronous or asynchronous, are in a vast space with varied possibilities, leading to different results; Consistent inference - maintaining a powerful neural network memorizing over time could lead to more effective and consistent inference over time; Uncertainty - inference itself will affect prediction, with a distribution, such uncertainty over the reasoning between nodes can be maintained.
 Models can easily tell which features that can distinguish positive examples the most.
 When the machine learning model has a reliable prediction performance, learned Bloom filter significantly reduce the FPR and save memory usage (Kraska et al., 2018).
 In summary, our main contributions in this work are as follows:
 Specifically, we show how one can systematically take techniques to perform attacks in the pixel space such as FGSM (Goodfellow et al., 2015) and PGD (Madry et al., 2017) and transform them to their semantic counterparts.

 Results of our experiments are reported in Section 8.
 We will see that by applying a decorrelation operator, i.g,Σ− 1 2 , we can not only effectively eliminate the correlations between computations of channel features and the magnitude of γ, but also equalize the channels’ magnitudes (Barlow et al., 1961; Bengio & Bergstra, 2009).
 These tricks let us use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to learn p and q jointly, as explained in Section 3.
In addition, we also demonstrate a way to harness our methodology for imitation learning (Section 7.3) and repulsion learning (Section 9.4), and we believe there may be many more potential applications in the future.
 Recently, many researchers have worked on compressing word-embedding matrices (Sainath et al., 2013; Acharya et al., 2019; Shu & Nakayama, 2017; Shi & Yu, 2018; Jegou et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2018; Winata et al., 2018).
 Recall that Cluster-GCN ignores all the intercluster links and trains each cluster separately; comparatively, in Chordal-GCN, we keep all the links, train every cluster separately, and at the same time capture the connections between clusters by an additional loss term.
 We close the generalization gap of adaptive gradient methods by proposing a new algorithm, called partially adaptive momentum estimation (Padam) method, which unifies Adam/Amsgrad with SGD-momentum to achieve the best of both worlds, by a partially adaptive parameter.
 We use martingale theory to characterize the largest possible change after multiple residual mappings, which is shown to be bounded given τ < 1/ √ L.
 These networks functionally resemble object detection networks (such as Fast-RCNN (Ren et al., 2015) and YOLO (Redmon et al., 2016)) in that they localize semantic objects by producing bounding box outputs.
 It defines the supernet and performs weight inheritance in a similar way.
 The work is built upon the following observation: a large portion of contributions to each decision are held by only a small fraction of features (Fong & Vedaldi, 2017; Chattopadhay et al., 2018; Du et al., 2018a).
 We can grow the spatial extent of memory exponentially with depth, while guaranteeing there is a connection pathway between the network input and every memory unit.
Optimization Issue.
The contribution of this work can be summarized as follows:
Meta-learning is a promising approach for learning optimizer for fast optimization or initial model for fast adaptation to novel task using a set of training problems as meta train set (Andrychowicz et al., 2016; Li & Malik, 2017; Wang et al., 2019; Ravi & Larochelle, 2017; Chen et al., 2017; Finn et al., 2017; Nichol et al., 2018).
 • Using neural networks to do machine learning of a potential.
 A continuous cursor is proposed to represent the possible quantization bit, leading to a more efficient search space.
 Under Assumption 2, the outcomes of SGC, GCN, and gfNN are similar to those of the corresponding NNs using “true features”.
 We evaluate the properties of FJD on a variant of the synthetic dSprite dataset (Matthey et al., 2017) and verify that it successfully captures the desired properties.
 As shown in Figure 1, simply combining different resolutions with network widths during testing can already achieve a better accuracy-efficiency tradeoff than US-Net without additional efforts.
 This reduces the cost of human supervision sufficiently allowing the DRL systems to train.
 In particular, when we generate a new query point x, we can observe the actual target value of interest, the teacher’s prediction g(x); this is not true for the supervised learning task, where no new labels can be observed.
 The proposed SDGM has both sparsity and discriminability, and determines the number of components automatically.
In this paper, we develop a novel Clustered Graph Transformer (CGT) framework by integrating Graph Attention Network (GAT) (Veličković et al., 2018) with Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) based on a unified attention encoder-decoder architecture (Bahdanau et al., 2015).
 Instead of using one, we consider three operators: logical conjunction, disjunction, and negation (illustrated in Figure 1).
OP-DMA: Our Approach.
 For the overview of our method, please refer to fig. 4.
 Inspired by the theoretical findings, we provide a practical algorithm that can learn from both labeled and unlabeled data for better adversarially robust generalization.
Regardless of these great efforts, existing studies either fail to explain the most fundamental problem in DML or fail to propose most effective approach towards addressing the fundamental challenge.
 The contributions are summarized as follows:
 Given the danger of adversarial attacks in real world situations, we find that it is important to evaluate our sparsity techniques under adversarial robustness.
 We call it Pseudo Distribution Matching (PDM).
 Recently, Kuditipudi et al., (2019) analyzed the connectivity between -dropout stable networks.
 Further, we also derive a rate of approximation of neural networks with invariance (Theorem 4) and its optimality, thus we show that an invariance property for deep neural networks does not reduce an expressive power.
 In summary, our contributions are:
 Each refinement step makes cheap, local adjustments to the variational posterior in the region of the sampled auxiliary variables.
 Moreover, our model achieved enhanced accuracy for datasets with reduced label rates, indicating the contribution of global information.
 Although their procedure is very promising from a statistical perspective, and theoretically valid under a very general set of assumptions, their technique requires human input and has a significant computational load as it uses a generative model for filling in certain regions of the target image.
In this paper, we borrow the scale-space extrema idea from SIFT, and propose extreme value preserving networks (EVPNet) to separate robust features from non-robust ones, with three novel architecture components to model the extreme values: (1) parametric DoG (pDoG) to extract extreme values in scale-space for deep networks, (2) truncated ReLU (tReLU) to suppress noise or non-stable extrema and (3) projected normalization layer (PNL) to mimic PCA-SIFT (Ke et al., 2004) like feature normalization.
 In summary, this paper makes the following three main contributions.
In this paper, motivated by the success of automated machine learning (AutoML) on designing data-dependent models (Hutter et al., 2018), and the fact that memorization heavily depends on many factors (Zhang et al., 2016; Arpit et al., 2017), we propose to exploit memorization effects automatically using AutoML techniques.
 The similarity learning component evaluates how similar the input images are, using the extracted features.
In particular, we study the key-step identification problem proposed by Lin et al., (2017).
 We use latent options since we operate in a setting without external goals.
 We then conclude in Section 6.
In our experiments, we compare our approach with several state-of-the-art intrinsic reward-based exploration approaches, including two recent approaches that also leverage the uncertainty in dynamic models.
 Despite its simplicity, Patch Gaussian achieves a new state of the art in the Common Corruptions robustness benchmark (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2018), while maintaining clean accuracy, indicating current methods have not reached this fundamental trade-off (Section 4.1).
 Our method, called Emphasizing Recent Experience (ERE), samples more aggressively recent experience while not neglecting past experience.
 On the other hand, GAN is able to achieve photo-realistic generation results (Karras et al., 2018a;b).
 The gradient oracle and hard thresholding complexities of SVRG-HT are O((n+κs̃) log(1 )) and O(κs̃ log( 1 )), respectively.
 We find that on Atari, CRL is able to obtain better overall performance compared to other approaches such as Forward Dynamics and RND, when used as a sole intrinsic bonus.
 If we present the FL training process as meta-training in the MAML language, and the FL personalization via gradient descent as meta-testing, we show in Section 2 that FedAvg (McMahan et al., 2017) and Reptile (Nichol et al., 2018), two popular FL and MAML algorithms, are very similar to each other; see also Khodak et al., (2019).
We here describe the main result informally.
 We approach the problem from two perspectives.
 d’Autume et al., (2019) trained language GANs from scratch, nevertheless, they only achieve the ”comparable” performance against LM.
 To represent the abstract predicates, we adopt the pre-trained word (sentence) vectors to initialize the predicates, connect them with linguistic relations defined in knowledge bases, and map them into a semantic embedding space (middle of fig. 1).
 And more importantly, if the hallucinator perfectly captures the target distribution, a classifier trained on a set of hallucinated examples, despite being generated from a small set of real examples, should produce roughly the same validation accuracy as a classifier trained on a large set of real examples, when these two sets are of the same sample size (Shmelkov et al., 2018).
 Our choice of the MIS problem is motivated by its hardness and applicability.
 Using this methodology, we build CIFAR-Hard – a mix of fine-grained and coarse-grained few-shot classification dataset derived from CIFAR-100.
 While a number of prior works ignore theH(G) term, we argue that jointly optimizing the entire quantity is needed to develop effective and useful exploration.
X-regularization naturally extends to more general losses and complex models and is closely related to self-training (Scudder, 1965), the classical semisupervised learning algorithm.
 Our contributions are as follows.
 To classify such a set requires either supervision, such as a labeled support set, or to somehow know the class semantics beforehand.
 Finally, we perform a thorough analysis of VAENAS on NAS-101 benchmark, to show the effectiveness of our proposed architecture sampling methods.
Generally, our contributions are as follows:
 Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR100 datasets corroborate the improvements of our techniques over the original GEM model.
 This implicitly is like data augmentation where image labels are assumed to be invariant to small translation, say by a few pixels.
 In this paper, we reveal that transforming a singleobjective reinforcement learning (SORL) to a multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is beneficial for solving the primary problem.
 SWAT reduces the total number of operations during training by 50%–80%.
 Then use an auxiliary loss function called Boundary-Calibration loss (BC-loss) to calibrate the generating distribution according to the decision boundaries of these pre-trained classifiers.
 Our proposed representation improves the AlexNet performance on CIFAR-100 by 4.15% with only 1.13% increase in the model size.
 Concretely, we prove that with reasonable assumptions, a causal model always provides stronger (i.g,, smaller value) differential privacy guarantees than a corresponding associational model trained on the same features and the same amount of added noise to the training dataset.
 In machine learning problems, 32-bit float number is typically adopted for representation.
 Their outputs coincide in those regions of input space where MNIST images tend to lie \\u2013 the \\u201cworld\\u201d of the problem, but differ significantly when tested on Gaussian inputs.
 Many authors have studied this effect (Jastrzębski et al., 2017; Smith & Le, 2017; Chaudhari & Soatto, 2018), but to our knowledge no paper has demonstrated a clear generalization gap between small and large batch training under a constant step budget on a challenging benchmark while simultaneously tuning the learning rate.
ly/site_atpcurr.
 The informativeness of an unobserved input x∗ / latent z∗ is then quantified by measuring the (expected) change in the posterior over model parameters after having observed x∗ / z∗.
 We demonstrate the effectiveness of ANT on text classification and language modeling tasks (§4).
 For a matrix W ∈ Rm×n, we denote by ‖W‖2 and ‖W‖F its operator norm and Frobenius norm respectively.
 Our findings show that:
 Our approach outperforms the existing data-free method in fooling rates and the evaluation is also done for less data scenarios (Section 4).
 We study optimally allocating a fixed reward budget in the setting of contests with rank-order allocation of prizes, where the utility of a submission has diminishing returns in effort.
 With all three tasks sharing the same contracting path, we introduce a new multi-task block for the expansive path.
 However, such methods, as exemplified by the state-of-the-art XML-CNN (Liu et al., 2017) and AttentionXML (You et al., 2018), can have prohibitive training costs and have not been shown to scale beyond a million labels on a single GPU.
 One should also be cautious in claiming to identify a complete replacement for batch normalization without first verifying that it matches the performance of batch normalization for a wide range of batch sizes.
 In some cases, it requires a totally different approach than regular CPD solutions.
 WaveNet (Oord et al., 2016a) is an example of successful deployment of such techniques for modeling the distribution of raw audio waveforms when conditioned on text.
 (2) Most deep learning models are trained using stochastic gradient descent that splits a giant training set into mini-batches.
 To validate appropriateness of the trajectory found in simulation, we deployed it on a real YuMi robot, as shown in Figure 1.
 However, the problem of designing deep unfolding methods for dealing with sequential signals is significantly less explored.
 Figure 2 offers one example of the impracticality of architectural alternatives.
 We address this question by introducing a new acquisition strategy that is based on label propagation.
 Exact methods are inapplicable for integer programming problems with large solution space (Farahani et al., 2013).
 At last, there is the only system available for zero-shot VC proposed by Qian et al., (2019).
) simply as “examples”.
 After training, it gives the probability of a test image being in a given domain.
 This allows us to provide insights into the precision requirements of any inference network for any given dataset.
 While these techniques achieve state-of-the-art results, their design is arguably cumbersome and non-intuitive.
 We argue that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based back-propagation in a DNN enables global learning between low-level pixel-to-pixel interactions and high-level detection and classification.
 Our experiments show a strong negative linear correlation between the distribution distances and network performance.
(1) Vector representation of local image content.
We evaluate our algorithm on different paintbrush configurations and datasets to highlights its benefits over prior reinforcement learning based methods.
Our work suggests that there is a wide range of time-series and sequence classification tasks where limited self-supervision could improve performance.
 Unlike other state of the art solutions, Hydra can generate multiple sentences with a considered sentiment using a unique input sentence.
Although our present experiments are small, we are motivated by the challenges of scale.
 In QSGD, stochastic gradient vectors are normalized to have unit L2 norm,and then compressed by quantizing each element to a uniform grid of quantization levels using a randomized method.
In this paper, we leverage these developments and revisit the relationship between architecture, hyperparameters, trainability, and generalization in the large-depth limit for a variety of neural networks.
 This mechanism loosely resembles the associative nature of human memory.
 It is necessary to note that this approach can be quite inefficient whenever the underlying task does not require complete memorization of the input sequences.
 In the second approach, the top nodes according to some parameterized ordering are selected and the induced subgraph becomes the next graph in the hierarchy.
We first validate our methods on three tasks.
 We may not know what network architectures (e.g, ResNet or VGG) will be used for inference, what object categories the downstream model recognizes (e.g, animals or scenes), or even what task will be performed on the processed image (e.g, classification or detection).
 The method extends to sequences from ideas recently developed for still images based on generative networks (Bora et al., 2018; Pajot et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019).
 An illustration of the common knowledge distillation and ensemble distillation as well as Hydra is shown in Figure 1 and a detailed methodology description is found in Section 2.
 In this paper we assume that it is the perfect model.
Our goal in this work is to show both (1) that meta-learning can reveal HIDS, and (2) that this means applying meta-learning to a learning scenario not only changes the way in which solutions are searched for, but also which solutions are ultimately found.
 As a result, the prediction encodes the interaction between nodes.
 fig.  1 provides an illustrative example of FICM for Super Mario Bros.
 The word representations are updated by their word-specific video representations to create visual-semantic representations.
 Online repositories such as Quantum Machine1 store a collection of datasets resulting from various QM simulations.
 Finally, we evaluate our approach in roundabout task with different traffic flow and show that our approach significantly improves the success rate of baseline.
 In order to demonstrate how the gradient estimate improves over time, we prove fast convergence to the true gradient for linear functions and show, that under simplifying assumptions, it offers an improvement over ES that depends on the Hessian for general functions.
 Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:
 Essentially, the weights in RwISTA act as a latent variable that controls the sparsity pattern of corresponding coefficients.
 More importantly, we propose a novel iterative method to search for hidden graph structure that augments the initial graph structure toward an optimal graph for the supervised prediction tasks.
 Because the target labels are not available during training, we try to keep the overall distribution of the target data as close to that of the source data as possible.
 LSTM consists of multiple operations and we create a custom abstract transformer for each of those.
Surprisingly, we find that we can permute all neuron indices in the same layer at the same cost as the loss at a permutation point reached by moving along the path that merges a single pair of neurons.
 Through back propagation, the gradient signal in the back part of the teacher network can be transferred to the student network and supervises the training process.
 Given that the word and topic representations encode complementary information, no prior work has explored transfer learning in TM using pretrained topics obtained from a large corpus.
 Among those regularizers, L2 regularization, perhaps the most simple one, tends to be the most effective for all algorithms and generally outperforms entropy regularization.
 In this case, we cannot use the class specific probability map, but the more generic low level features of a DCNN can be utilized as feature description for the algorithm.
 In summary, we describe three main contributions of our research as follows:
Not all programming problems can be nicely defined as puzzles.
There are very few works that focus on the initialization strategy of the bias term of the neural network.
 RPP consists of two parts : the reweighted `1 minimization and the proximal operator.
 We also show that these new abilities are achieved without sacrificing generation quality compared to GQN.
 As shown in fig.  1, DTS can maintain high scalability even when latency is as high as 1000ms.
 We argue that rather than deriving an algorithm based on these choices, it might be preferable to directly model iterative games between the two players.
In this paper, we apply optimal transport theory to analyze the behavior of distributions.
 We show on several control experiments that a model-free agent trained in our stochastic forward dynamics environment is not only able to better explore and learn faster but often also comes to better solutions than agents trained in deterministic environments.
 Importantly, attribute relations can complement node relations in node representation learning.
Based on this idea, we define new evaluation criteria to test the importance of a set of features.
 Their pioneering work had several limitations though.
 The core idea of this unsupervised approach is to use a generative model to provide near-manifold negative samples throughout the training process for which the model is either implicitly or explicitly encouraged to give low likelihood estimates.
 Recently, few generative approaches have been proposed to overcome this issue as these methods allow for storage of the relevant samples from previous tasks with limited memory.
 We also validate our theorem through experiments on the MNIST data set.
 Rather than beginning with a parsed corpus, we automatically generate a large number of structurally-similar sentences, without presupposing their formal structure (§3.1).
 Su and Yang (2019) improved the convergence guarantee in terms of the k-th largest eigenvalue for certain target functions.
 In the absence of the noise, the linear predictor can fit each training example perfectly.
 Inside one VQ region, f is simply an affine mapping.
 Furthermore, in most existing methods, the novelty and quality in the neighboring area of the current state are not well utilized to guide the exploration of the agent.
2. Noise resistant boosting (Bootkrajang & Kabán, 2013) addresses boosting algorithms which are susceptible to noisy data and proposing variants which can perform under a certain noisy conditions.
 However, they attempt to predict the optimal value which is policy dependent and requires a large number of samples to learn.
 Thus, the exploration and exploitation is decoupled in our method.
 Besides, we show that L2T-MITTEN can be used as an analytic tool to extract interpretable task dependency structures at different levels on real-world datasets.
 In contrast, block-diagonalization of √ NGD preserves sta-bility of parameter update dynamics, yielding efficient and stable learning algorithms.
 Finally, we address question 4 by showing that our meta-learned initializations are competitive with ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) trained initializations for up to 400 labeled examples.
 To this end, we study and develop new approaches specially catered to the large batch setting of our interest.
We call our approach self-ensemble label filtering (SELF) - that establishes model ensemble learning as a backbone to form a solid consensus of the self-ensemble predictions to filter out the noisy labels progressively.
 Then, we design a graph-to-sequence (Graph2Seq) model based generator that encodes the graph representation of a text passage and decodes a question sequence using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
 Then, we perform an empirical evaluation in challenging RL problems proposing multitask variants of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) (Mnih et al., 2015) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) (Lillicrap et al., 2015) algorithms.
 In contrast, edge attributes e.g, length and orientation are widely used in traditional graph matching models (Cho et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2018) for constructing the affinity matrix K.
 In other words, our proposed GIL attempts to learn some transferable knowledge underlying in the structure relations from training samples to validation samples, such that the learned structure relations can be better self-adapted to the new testing stage.
The main contribution of this paper is SQIL:
The contributions of this paper could be summarized as three-fold.
 This test is used to decide if two unlabelled images belong to the same (new) class or not, generating a set of noisy pairwise pseudo-labels.
 For example, Fujimoto et al., (2018) propose the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3) which reduces the overestimation bias by taking the minimum value between two critics.
 We note that Hoyer regularizer is both almost everywhere differentiable and scale invariant, satisfying the desired property of a sparsityinducing regularizer.
 Another example is the lower and upper bound on the weights, that is, l ≤ w ≤ u for some predefined l and u.
 In a clique, they completely overlap.
 Following this, DPP is also applied on some visual tasks, such as video summarization (Sharghi et al., 2018), ranking (Liu et al., 2017) and image classification (Xie et al., 2017).
Our major contributions of the proposed ARML are three-fold:
 This motivates us to introduce an auxiliary variable to enhance the flexibility of the variational decoder, whose entropy is approximated by the third variational trick.
 To overcome this problem, we quantize the bias to 8-bit and finetune the bias of the model.
 Each bag is associated with a bag level ucc label.
 Secondly, since APD does not change the network topology as existing expansion-based approaches do, APD-Net is memory-efficient, and even more so with hierarchically shared parameters.
 Fortunately, maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MERL) (Levine, 2018) provide a tool to formalize the planning as a probabilistic inference task.
 Section 3 demonstrates numerous experiments using this synthetic construction that suggest implicit regularization is at work.
 We train a separate lightweight distribution classifier to recognize distinct features in the distributions of softmax outputs of transformed clean images and predict the class label.
 However, the vanilla powers-of-two quantization method only increases the resolution near the mean and ignores other regions at all when the bit-width is increased.
 Whereas, inconsistent components ( A, B) mainly represent unreliable knowledge or noises.
 The two forms of reasoning are interleaved across the statements making it challenging for existing models.
 This distinction plays a key role in the stability of the algorithm.
 Furthermore, since our method outputs subgoals conditioned on a goal image, we can use the same model and approach to plan to solve many different long-horizon tasks, even with previously unseen objects.
 Consider one message passing iteration on a graph with |V | nodes and |E| edges.
 One is perturbation shrinkage: if the input is adversarial, i.g,, x = x0 + δ, the perturbation δ will shrink by a factor λ after performing MI, which is exactly the mixup ratio of MI according to the similarity between triangles.
 Therefore, the center loss cannot concentrate on inducing strong intra-class compactness to construct high-density regions and consequently could not lead to reliable robustness, as shown in our experiments.
 Examples of incremental learning in these models can be seen in figure 1, which we discuss further in section 4.
 Indeed, gluing together a broken vase will require the agent to learn an array of complex planning and motor skills, which is the ultimate goal of such intrinsic rewards.
 Formally, {Y t}t∈T ⊥ T | X .
 At the regular points, the Brenier potential is differentiable, its gradient map (the transport map) is continuous; at the singularities, the Brenier potential is continuous but not differentiable, and its gradient map is discontinuous.
 We have published videos of our experimental results1 and the experiment model code2.
 In this work, we propose DivideMix, which addresses learning with label noise in a semi-supervised manner.
 A deeper understanding about the influence of misclassified and correctly classified examples on the robustness is still missing in the literature.
 Furthermore, in the full batch (deterministic) scenario, our analysis selects η2 = 0, thus reducing MaSS to the classical Nesterov’s method (15).
 In particular, we show that training these layers with self-supervision and a single image already achieves as much as two thirds of the performance that can be achieved by using a million different images.
 On the other hand, using some of the labeled data for training is beneficial both in terms of disentanglement and downstream performance.
 These surfaces are piece-wise linear functions, with non-differentiabilities or ‘folds’ between linear regions.
 We show that such score turns likelihood-based generative models into practical and effective OOD detectors, with performances comparable to, or even better than the state-of-theart.
 Token contribution decreases monotonically with depth, but the corresponding token typically remains the largest individual contributor.
 Deep neural networks, frequently observed in practices, is much less likely to get stuck in sub-optimal points.
Building on this idea, we would like to learn to utilize distributional signatures in the context of cross-class transfer.
We introduce a required condition, akin to a model assumption made in (Daneshmand et al., (2018)), that ensures the dynamic procedure in Algorithm 2 produces updates with suitable correlation with the negative curvature directions of the function f .
 To gain insight into why adversarial policies succeed, we analyze the activations of the victim’s policy network using a Gaussian Mixture Model and t-SNE (Maaten and Hinton, 2008).
 Compared to models based on pixel-level autoregressive prediction, VideoFlow achieves substantially faster test-time image synthesis 1, making it much more practical for applications that require real-time prediction, such as robotic control (Finn & Levine, 2017).
 On the FIGER entity-typing dataset, our model sets a new state of the art.
On the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks (Sta, 2006), NCF outperforms the state-of-the-art in address and branch prediction by a significant margin.
This paper makes the following contributions:
 From an optimization perspective, the PL condition has been considered extensively for designing faster optimization algorithms in the literature (Karimi et al., 2016; Reddi et al., 2016; Lei et al., 2017).
 And as we show both theoretically and empirically, our method is numerically stable and accounts for both classification accuracy and robustness.
 These findings suggest that CapsNets with class conditional reconstructions have the potential to address the real issue with adversarial examples – networks should make predictions based on the same properties of the image that people use rather than using features that can be manipulated by an imperceptible adversarial attack.
 While black-box attacks were also considered there, they focused on training generators with dynamic distillation.
 Subjective experiments on the MAD test set reveal the relative strengths and weaknesses among the classifiers, and identify the training techniques and architecture choices that improve the generalizability to natural image manifold.
Several model based algorithms have been proposed for infinite horizon MDP, for example Rmax (Brafman & Tennenholtz, 2003), MoRmax (Szita & Szepesvári, 2010) and UCRL-γ (Lattimore & Hutter, 2012).
 The main contributions of the paper are summarized below:
 However, their coresets are data-dependent; therefore, they cannot guarantee robustness over inputs.
 Specifically, every nonlinear point in the activation functions creates a group of the non-differentiable boundaries between the cells, while the linear parts of activations correspond to the smooth and multilinear interiors.
 Moreover, the optimal value of smay change during the entirety of the training process.
 There are also a number of works designing network structures for multiagent communication (Sukhbaatar et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2019).
 This allows us to compare the Pose2Frame network directly with recent video-to-video solutions.
 However, computing our certified radius in practice faces two challenges: 1) it is hard to exactly compute the probability pl and the k largest probabilities pi’s, and 2) the equation about the certified radius does not have an analytical solution.
 Whether the agent learns the optimal policy or not is thus decided purely at random based on the initial Q-value estimates.
 By stacking multiple layers of multi-modal Transformer attention modules, the derived representation is of rich capability in aggregating and aligning visual-linguistic clues.
 The design of DKs that is agnostic to data coordinates naturally leads to two variants – the global DK and the local DK, which behave differently in practice as we later investigate.
 As an initial solution to this problem, this paper makes use of a recently introduced class of models, known as Prior Networks (Malinin & Gales, 2018; 2019), which explicitly model a conditional distribution over categorical distributions by parameterizing a Dirichlet distribution.
1, we show that the main reason for this degradation is the over-penalization and under-penalization caused by SA.
 This relates to Bau et al., (2018) who proposed a framework based on interventions on internal variables of a GAN which, in contrast to our fully unsupervised approach, requires semantic information.
We conclude with a discussion of some implications of our findings as a practical and principled tool for understanding network design at small scale and for efficient computation and trade-off design in general.
 Moreover, CLN2INV finds invariants for each program in 1.
 The volume-preserving two-way autoencoder not only greatly reduces the memory demand and computational cost, but also enjoys the theoretically guaranteed property of no information loss.
We apply order learning to facial age estimation.
 On the other hand, human beings perform similarly on both the EASY and HARD set.
 This insight provides us a flexible class of robustness metrics for controlling representations learned by VAEs.
 We propose a hierarchical search algorithm to cope with the complex search space.
 Much to our surprise, we found out that these baselines can even perform better than GNNs on some datasets; this calls for moderation when reporting improvements that do not clearly outperform structure-agnostic competitors.
As is often the case for generalization analyses, the central technical lemmas are bounds on covering numbers.
Notation.
 GAIL generalizes IRL by formulating the IL problem as minimax optimization, which can be solved by alternating gradient-type algorithms in a more scalable and efficient manner.
In a typical transfer learning procedure, all neural network layers up to the penultimate layer are transferred to a new model and then a Softmax layer is added and re-trained on a new task.
 In particular, we prove that given the mean-field state µ, the sequence of policies generated by the actor converges linearly to the optimal policy π∗µ.
 For example, we can perform a rich set of queries, ranging from existential queries (e.g, is there a faulty input to the network?), to counting queries (e.g, how many faulty inputs exist?), using logic-based reasoners (Baluta et al., 2019; Shih et al., 2019).
For our experiments, we created a specialized programming language, called Searcho1 (Section 2), based on strongly-typed functional languages such as Standard ML and Haskell.
 Moreover, MONet embeds a convolutional neural network (CNN) inside of an recurrent neural network (RNN) that is unrolled for each scene component, which does not scale well to more complex scenes.
 By optimizing an adversarial loss, filter generators can be jointly trained with a conditional image generation network.
 One of the current criticisms of generative models is that they simply interpolate between datapoints, and fail to generate anything truly new, but our results add nuance to this story.
 We show that our proposed method can help mitigate the problem at its source, i.g,in the data annotation itself.
 While this approach successfully generates adversarial examples, it is expensive in how many times the model is queried.
 In this paper, we specifically point out linearly decaying the learning rate to 0 at the end of the budget, may be more robust than more complicated strategies suggested in prior work.
 Given the recent surge of interest in the finite time analysis of the vanilla TD Dalal et al., (2018a); Bhandari et al., (2018); Dalal et al., (2018b); Srikant and Ying (2019), it becomes imperative to reanalyze the VRTD and accurately understand whether and how variance reduction can help to improve the convergence accuracy over vanilla TD.
 First, their bounds use the same normalizing quantity for each example, whereas our bounds are tighter and more natural because we use a different normalizer for each training example – the local Lipschitzness for that particular example.
 Moreover, these works fundamentally differ from ours in that they do not consider a task-based notion of learnability, instead focusing on the global federated learning problem to learn a single global model.
 Despite the wide usage, these algorithms are handcrafted and therefore cannot be optimized for a specific task.
 In addition, we show that the deep networks implicitly perform a projection onto an adaptively-selected low-dimensional subspace capturing features of natural images.
 Instead of directly taking the sign of gradient estimation, our algorithm utilizes the scale of random direction.
 More impressively, our trained BQNs achieve comparable log-likelihood against Gaussian Bayesian neural network (BNN) trained with stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB) (Shridhar et al., 2019) (the performance of Gaussian BNNs are expected to be better than BQNs since they allows for continuous random variables).
We characterize the scaling of DD-PPO by the steps of experience per second with N workers relative to 1 worker.
 For instance, robots may use a confidence set over predicted trajectories to determine whether it is safe to act with high probability.
 In contrast, our model is able to make the adaption fast and the number of tasks is unlimited during training.
 Such method cannot be directly extended to handling the convolution in regular 2D CNNs where filters are 3-dimensional in an efficient manner.
 For two superclasses (e.g, mammal and vehicle), the algorithm is capable of partitioning the mammal class into cat and dog, and the second superclass into car and truck.
 Now, further suppose that one of the two ways is common to both a and b, i.g,, say ga2 = gb2 = gab, whereas, the other two are example specific, i.g,, \\u3008ga1 , gb1\\u3009 = 0.
 MEMO is based on the same basic structure of the external memory presented in EMN (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015), but its new architectural components can potentially allow for flexible weighting of individual elements in memory and so supporting the form of the inferential reasoning outlined above.
 These boundaries can be easily obtained from dialogue state itself by simply measuring number of the tokens of individual slots.
 To overcome this situation, we store and process increments rather than the cumulative values g(t) and propose dynamic evolution in terms of increments.
 In our experiments (see Figure 2), variance of the batch statistics associated with gradients in BP, due to small batch size, is even larger than that of the widelyknown batch statistics (mean, variance of feature maps).
In this new work, we propose a sleep-inspired algorithm to defend against adversarial attacks as well as to increase ANN robustness to noise.
 We point out the second aspect is challenging especially for SGD due to the uncertainty of its optimization trajectory caused by stochastic gradients.
 Moreover, the nonparametric method for analyzing spatial point data patterns is not related to specific parametric families of models, which only requires the intensity to be well-defined.
 This paper makes the following contributions:
 While W1 and W2 exhibit lower uncertainties (more contributions in learning Task 1), W3, W4, and W5 appear to have larger uncertainties, with the highest STD in W5, making them available to learn more tasks.
 Since training loss of deep networks can often be minimized to zero, outlier with a large loss has a large impact on the model.
 Moreover, it incurs only minor memory overhead because a large number of weights are shared across ensemble members.
 We prove that this constraint does not invalidate the universal approximation capabilities of neural networks.
 Inspired by the property, we first propose spatial difference layer (SDL) to efficiently learn the local representations by aggregating neighboring information in the sparse data points.
Another practical issue is that generating a token from a large vocabulary via the softmax output layer is often computationally heavy.
 Unfortunately, the minimax nature of this problem makes stability and convergence difficult to analyze.
 In response, we motivate a real-world scenario wherein a notable portion of the nodes have no feature vectors.
 We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that such directions can be used to control precisely the generative process and show that our method can reveal interesting insights about the structure of the latent space.
 The underlying reason is that an angular coordinate lies on S1 instead of R1.
 (5)Hence the critical point A can be viewed as a “fixed point” of the map: PO(n;R)  ((·)Y )◦3Y ∗  from O(n;R) to itself.
 Hence, the output of such sensors can provide a second modality for self-supervision.
 Through a simple sign randomization, the training loss of an over-parametrized two-layer neural network can be coupled with that of a quadratic model (Section 3).
 Srinivasan et al., (2018) use actor-critic policy optimization methods to minimize regret and achieve performance comparable to NFSP.
 In this case, the oracle selects output p2(x∗) as both buttons are correctly resized and the distance between them was reduced to match the smaller device width.
 The proposed method minimizes the triplet loss function which 1) encourages to have samelabeled data in different leaf nodes move close and 2) pushes away data points that frequently fall in the same leaf nodes regardless of their class labels.
Our main findings are as follows:
Optimization is performed ex post facto in the activation space, therefore no re-training or finetuning is needed.
 Because the proposed model does not restrict the generator architecture, we can condition any type of image generator (e.g, PGGAN (Karras et al., 2018), StyleGAN (Karras et al., 2019)) on camera parameters.
 The performance of the simple baseline however indicates that we need to interpret existing results2 with a grain of salt, and be wary of methods that tailor to the benchmark.
 We believe this is because the correlations between different class probabilities contains useful information that regularizes the learning problem.
Also the learned noise distribution is transferable, which is especially useful for few-shot learning setting where only a few examples are given to solve a novel task.
 The Rényi fair inference framework proposed in this paper also belongs to this in-process category.
In Section 3 we describe the block substitutions used in BlockSwap, distillation via attention transfer, and Fisher information.
 We also selected multiple optimization algorithms and looked at different stopping criteria for training convergence.
 Third, in the computation of self-attention, output neurons in each position depend on all input neurons from different positions (namely cross-position dependency), unlike the case in recurrent neural networks where outputs depend on only the hidden features from the previous position and the current input.
The theoretical tool used for the proof of Theorem 1 is an explicit characterization of the permutation equivariant polynomials over sets of vectors in Rk using power-sum multi-symmetric polynomials.
 We in particular study the interesting case when the mini-batch sizes of both algorithms satisfy the relation B HBloc, as in this case both algorithms (local SGD and minibatch SGD) evaluate the same number of stochastic gradients between synchronization steps.
 Adding identity loss term was suggested in (Zhu et al., 2017) to alleviate the tint shift issue, i.g,, the extended CycleGAN loss is defined asLext(G,F ) := L(G,F ) + αid · (Ey∼Y‖F (y)− y‖+ Ex∼X‖G(x)− x‖) ,where the factor αid ≥ 0 determines the weight of the identity loss term.
 Indeed, as we will draw theoretically in this paper, DropEdge either reduces the convergence speed of over-smoothing or relieves the information loss caused by it.
 Depending on the chosen prior, networks can match activation distributions to e.g, the uniform distribution for better quantization, or the Gaussian to enforce behavior similar to batch-normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015).
 BRKGA produces good solutions in just a few seconds even for real-world TensorFlow graphs with thousands of nodes, and we use learning to improve the solution quality significantly at similar speed.
 Use of learning in the SLAM module provides flexibility with respect to input modality, learned global policy can exploit regularities in layout of real world layout of environments, while learned local policies can use visual feedback to exhibit more robust behaviour.
 This motivates the design of EMPIR, which successfully combines the higher robustness of low-precision models with the higher unperturbed accuracy of the full-precision models.
 As such, only a few core definitions about the Lie group H (group product, inverse, Log, and action on Rd) need to be implemented in order to build full G-CNNs that are locally equivariant to the transformations in H .
To understand the role of the learning objective and the input representation, we study the effect of (i) the next sentence prediction objective, (ii) the language identifier in the training data, and (iii) the level of tokenization in the input representation (character, word-piece, or word tokenization).
The main contributions of this paper are:
 The pre-stabilizing controller ensures that the QP is well conditioned and promotes a highly accurate global solution, which in turn ensures that the gradients calculated in the backwards pass are accurate.
 Our proposed attack algorithm is a general two-step algorithm and can be directly applied to the two commonly-used threat models (observation manipulation and action manipulation).
 This generality means that a relatively computationally expensive meta-learning process can be amortized over the lifetimes of many agents in a wide variety of environments.
 This hyper-parameter has a dramatic effect on the performance of the algorithm.
In this paper, we propose to use synthetic gradient (Jaderberg et al., 2017) to enable transduction, such that the variational posterior is implemented as a function of the labeled set dlt and the unlabeled set xt.
Our method differs from previous methods by several methodological improvements.
 After that, the agent’s test policy is a contextual policy that takes the inferred subtask graph as an input and maximizes the expected return (See Figure 1).
 Consequently, RAPP incorporates hidden reconstruction errors as well as the ordinary reconstruction error in detecting novelty.
 We demonstrate the result of this synergy by building a physics-inspired learning pipeline with straightforward implementation and matching the state-of-the-art with this framework.
 We further reveal the connection between Gp(z|x) and the Fisher information matrix when p(z|x) is parameterized by θ (Section 3).
 At the end of the learning, atomic blocks with very small weights (e.g, < 0.001) are removed from the network and we obtain the final network which has fewer FLOPs.
 In detail, MINE employs a lower-bound to the MI based on the Donsker-Varadhan representation of the KL-divergence, and JSD follows the formulation of f-GAN KL-divergence.

 We show that ‖f‖R precisely captures the representational cost of f , and in particular is finite if and only if f can be approximated arbitrarily well by a bounded norm, but possibly unbounded width, ReLU network.
 To achieve these objectives, we use compositionality to separate semantics and syntax of an input sentence, so that we can convert label prediction algorithm to sequence to sequence algorithm for continual learning.
 While the VAE can help the agent to correct its trajectory to some extent, the agent may still occasionally enter states that are far away from demonstrations, where the VAE has no clue how to correct it.
 In this way, we restrict that our features only convey information within the local context of a part.
 Our attacks can either change the entire caption to the target (Chen et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2019) or take on more challenging tasks like changing one or two specific target words from the caption to a target.
 More importantly, in our experiments, consistency regularization can always further improve the model performance when spectral normalization is used, whereas the performance gains of previous regularization methods diminish in such case.
 In SCALOR, we achieve scalability with respect to the object density by parallelizing both the propagation and discovery processes, reducing the time complexity of processing each image from O(N) to O(1), with N being the number of objects in an image.
We rigorously evaluate our approach by defending six victim models, against four recent and effective DNN stealing attack strategies (Papernot et al., 2017b; Juuti et al., 2019; Orekondy et al., 2019).
Complementary studies (Tarr & Pinker, 1989; Oliva & Torralba, 2007) suggest that our visual system encodes orientation atypicality relative to the context rather than on an absolute manner (fig. 1).
 Specifically, we show that directly learning the bitwidth is not optimal.
 University of Cambridge.
 However these bounds also depend on the size of networks, which makes them vacuous for very large neural networks.
 However, the trace has little information about the computational graph, e.g, the layers, branches or skip connections, or the architectural parameters, e.g, the number of filters in a convolutional layer.
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
 The reason for this is that pruning optimization objectives are often in conflict with traditional transfer learning, as both drive weight values in different directions: zero for pruning and the initial starting point for transfer learning.
In this paper, our main contributions are summarized as follows:
Our theory enables us to investigate asymptotic behaviors of graph NNs via the spectral distribution of the underlying graphs.
 Motivated by Deep InfoMax Hjelm et al., (2018), we aim to use mutual information maximization for unsupervised representation learning on the entire graph.
 This is in sharp contrast to the design principles (e.g, “going deeper” with skip connections) underpinning many modern DNNs.
 The use of these feature-wise transformation layers allows us to simulate various distributions of image features during the training stage, and thus improve the generalization ability of the metric function in the testing phase.
 The proposed method is fundamentally different from the previous approaches like Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017) and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS) (Aljundi et al., 2018), which we indicate as sample-based approaches.
 Furthermore, we also show that when equalized odds is satisfied, BER serves as an upper bound on the error of each subgroup.
 This reflects the following significant challenges in a dynamic, real warehouse:• Multi-valuedness: It is common for 10+ identical pallets of the same product to arrive in a single shipment, and then leave the warehouse at different times depending on the consumption of the end consumer.
 Moreover, the counting capabilities of FOC2 can be mimicked in FO (albeit with more than just two variables), hence FOC2 classifiers are in fact logical classifiers according to our definition.
 Reducing the spectral norm of K decreases the variance of the mini-batch gradient, which has been linked to improved convergence speed (Johnson & Zhang, 2013).
 With these challenges, we investigate whether each of our models can learn to leverage either object-level of Gestalt cues for grouping.
 Our work sees itself in the tradition of previous studies that showcase emergent complexity in simple physically grounded environments (Sims, 1994a; Bansal et al., 2018; Jaderberg et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019); the success in these settings inspires confidence that inducing autocurricula in physically grounded and open-ended environments could eventually enable agents to acquire an unbounded number of human-relevant skills.
 The training log and performance of each architecture are provided for each run.
 Strikingly, a seemingly strong pre-training strategy (i.g,, graph-level multi-task supervised pre-training using a state-of-the-art graph neural network architecture for graph-level prediction tasks) only gives marginal performance gains.
*ese|.
 Arora et al., (2018) characterized the implicit dimensionality based on so called layer-cushion quantity and suggested to perform random projection to obtain a compressed network.
 By analyzing the Lyapunov stability of this system for different minima, they showed a relation between the learning rate choice and the accessible minima set, i.g,, the subset of the local optima that GD can converge to.
By contrast, we propose a representation of linear maps as products of sparse matrices with specific predefined sparsity patterns (Section 2), and show that it does satisfy our desiderata: it retains the expressiveness of unstructured sparsity, while being differentiably learnable and efficient like other structured representations.
 We further investigate the adversarial robustness of low-rank networks, which are thought to be more resilient to attack, and we find empirically that their robustness is often lower than the baseline or even a purposefully constructed high-rank network.
 For example, Ribeiro et al., (2017) shows disassortative graphs where nodes of the same class exhibit high structural similarity but are far apart from each other.
 Previous algorithm Fedprox Sahu et al., (2018) doesn’t require the two mentioned assumptions and incorporates FedAvg as a special case when the added proximal term vanishes.
 The extra loss is computed by comparing two probability distributions, the first of which is from the detailed model training prediction and the second of which is from a ground-truth token-wise distribution and is defined as a kind of data-dependent Gaussian prior distribution.
 For instance, strong branching is generally one of the best performing heuristics for BaB methods in terms of the number of branches, but it is computationally prohibitive as each branching decision requires an expensive exhaustive search over all possible options.
For more advanced deep RL tasks, we extend our intuition and propose Structured Value-based Deep RL (SV-RL), applicable for deep Q-value based methods such as DQN (Mnih et al., 2015).
 It avoids the second minimization step needed in energy function based approach, and does not require the output structure to be nested.
 More structured methods are needed.
 In all these metrics, our method outperforms the baselines consistently.
Based on their explicit learning of compositional structures, capsule networks can be seen as an alternative (to CNNs) for better learning of compositional representations.
 We empirically evaluate the scores for objects extracted in the context of human priors and hence find the potential of using our method as an unsupervised method for object discovery.
 De facto, these examples illustrate how to develop “gadgets” to encode a variety of constraints and prior knowledge in DRNets.
 Inspired by stochastically controlled stochastic gradient (SCSG) (Lei & Jordan, 2017) that estimates the gradient, G(x) can also be estimated by using a snapshot x̃s, in which G(x̃s) is not computed directly, but is estimated through a random subset from n.
 It is fully differentiable and trained end-to-end with backpropagation of derivatives calculated with policy gradient methods.
 In other words, anomalies are harder to fit and own larger gradient magnitude in the later stage.
 Zhang et al., (2017) included data augmentation in their analysis of generalization of deep networks, but it was questionably considered an explicit regularizer similar to weight decay and dropout.

 From the topological view, the residual connections are rather denser than the natural perspective.
 We also call the optimizer as the attacker network.
 To further alleviate it, we introduce an intra-class objective in the target domain to pursue the class compactness.
 We first divide the observation states into two sets, the context states and the states of interest.
 That is to say, they investigate the probability of failure over a violation rather than confirming that this probability is exactly zero.
 These later findings appear to be inconsistent with Bowers et al., (2016) who failed to observe selective representations in fully connected NNs trained on stimuli one-at-a-time (see fig.  1), but the measures of selectivity that have been applied across studies are different, and accordingly, it is difficult to directly compare results.
 (Peng et al., 2016) proposed an event-based classification based on static learning method, named Bag of Events (BOE in short).
 In these works, the convergence rate is dictated by the least eigenvalue of the kernel.
 Unseen nodes can be represented based on their neighborhood structure.
 RWS can be viewed as an adaptive importance-sampling approach which iteratively improves its proposal distribution while simultaneously optimising θ via stochastic approximation.
 To facilitate pruning CNNs by DRL, for each layer, we first design a novel prediction component to estimate the importance of channels, and then develop a DRL-based component to learn the sparsity ratio of the layer, i.g,, how many channels should be pruned.
In order to simultaneously address these technical problems, we propose a new formulation of the deep neural network problem, along with a novel Deep Learning Alternating Minimization (DLAM) algorithm.
We make Three major contributions:
 For the effective progressive training and generation, instead of the usual upsampling method such as the nearest neighbor used in image generation, PUGAN uses a new upsampling methods often employed in the digital signal processing (DSP) field in an attempt to preserve the frequency information of the original data (Oppenheim, 1999).
 The proposed end-to-end network provides 15× faster convergence as compared to the hierarchical LSTM model used in earlier works (Mirhoseini et al., 2017; 2018).
 Other causes include numerical attributes of nodes and edges as well as the sizes of the data set.
 From this perspective, we propose a novel explanation for the efficacy of lrDecay: an initially large learning rate suppresses the memorization of noisy data while decaying the learning rate improves the learning of complex patterns.
 With this construction, the inference task decomposes into local inference subtasks, then they introduce amortized inference and use inference networks to identify solutions to these subtasks (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Dai et al., 2015; Miao et al., 2016).
 Furthermore, since inference requires only a single forward pass over the neural network, our approach is faster to achievecomparable accuracy than methods which must solve an optimization problem every time.
 Experimental results show that BNSR outperforms all of them.
 Further, both the asymmetric knowledge transfer between tasks at two different timesteps as well as the uncertainty-based attenuation of attention weights are found to be useful in improving the generalization performance.
 We show that, in all tasks, the learning rate warm-up stage can be safely removed and thus, the number of hyper-parameter is reduced.
We then argue that the simple modification to AII attains better property from the optimization perspective while achieving the same goal asymptotically.
We evaluate MULTIPOLAR in a variety of environments ranging from classic control problems to challenging robotics simulations.
Using existing image metrics based on CNNs for this problem is not optimal either: Natural images only cover a small fraction of the space of possible 2D data, and numerical simulation outputs are located in a fundamentally different data manifold within this space.
 The GWM provides not only more representation powers (less train loss), but also better generalization performances (less test loss) for various GNNs.
 In addition to the existing grounding metric that calculate the grounding accuracy for each object class (Zhou et al., 2019), we further include a grounding metric that compute grounding accuracy for each generated sentence.

 Moreover, for most ride-sharing platforms, a passenger is more likely to send a new request from the location where his/her last trip ends in.
 For the fitting of GPD, we dynamically update the threshold.
 We use the supervised code to condition the model on the given supervised signal while the unsupervised code captures other latent variations in the data since it is trained using all label categories.
 Notably, we suggest that certain previous meta-learning methods may have benefitted from implicit regularization.
 The deviation between D̂real and Dreal leads to the generalization error, i.g,, the gap between d(Dreal,Dg) and d(D̂real,Dg).
dimensional mask (one dimension per aspect) jointly, in an unsupervised and multi-task learning manner.

 Our contribution can be summarized as follows:
Our analysis handles stochasticity in both objective function and ZO gradient estimator, and shows that ZO-Min-Max yields O(1/T + 1/b + d/q) convergence rate, where T is number of iterations, b is mini-batch size, q is number of random direction vectors used in ZO gradient estimation, and d is number of optimization variables.
 We show that reducing the head size to a value below the input sequence length hurts the representation power of each head.
 We believe this to be the first approach that does not require full-sequence decoding within the training loop.

 We are provided with paired examples (x, c) where x is the observation and c is a control variate.
We show that as this weight increases, we approach a vanishing noise limit that corresponds to a deterministic auto-encoder.
 Considering that this operation only produces a single subsequence, we refer this step as local motion composition.
 In this process, with the increase of the network layers and the compression of the image size, substantial detailed information of the spatial structure is inevitably lost.
 Compared with other graph attention mechanisms (Veličković et al., 2018; Abu-El-Haija et al., 2018; Ishiguro et al., 2019), ours is architecturally simple, computationally lightweight, and general, i.g,, its applicability is not limited to generation tasks.
 While the first accounts for the uncertainty that is associated to model parameters, the second corresponds to the uncertainty inherently present in the data3.
 It can be seen as reduced degree of weight sharing.
 Here, we assume r < τ2, and its lowdimensionality indicates the existence of similar (τ, τ )-patches (i.g,, self-similarity) in the image, and it would provide some “impedance” which passes self-similar patches and resist/ignore others.
 This is important in both industry and academic applications in reality where expanding unsupervised GNN models is more suitable due to the limited availability of class labels.
Critically, SplitLBI enjoys a nice property that important subnet architecture can be rapidly learned via the structural sparsity parameter Γ following the iterative regularization path, without fully training a dense network first.

 These results remains true for 2 datasets, MNIST and CIFAR10, and 2 NN architectures, a custom, relatively shallow one and a Wide Residual Network (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016).
 That is, without a proper value of such an input, they have no guarantee that the selected data is sufficient for DNN testing.
 We demonstrate the quality of cINNs for conditional image generation and uncover emergent properties of the latent space, for the tasks of conditional MNIST generation and diverse colorization of ImageNet.
 Because of the fact that GAN training is difficult and unstable, its huge network parameters drag down the calculation speed Salimans et al., (2016).
 However, most of these models are only tested on datasets with considerably small article/summary length.
 Since the closed world assumption also holds true for Bayesian methods as the approximated posterior probability cannot be computed for unknown classes, misclassification still occurs, as the open space risk is unbounded (Boult et al., 2019).
 We point out that the method of (minibatch) estimators suffers from the curse of dimensionality and other drawbacks, making their estimation accuracy decay significantly with the increase of the dimension of the latent space, and some strong correlated distributions can be falsely estimated to have low total correlation.
 Besides, we evaluate this assumption across many standard datasets and show that with the proposed tighter ELBO, OSPOT-VAE surpasses the best semi-supervised generative models by a large margin and achieves state-of-the-art performance on Cifar-100 with 10k labels.
 The discovery of Gomory cuts and other subsequent work such as branch and bound, has led to the viability of the cutting plane method for solving mixed integer linear programs.

 Furthermore, in many cases we are only interested in the distribution of organisms in an environmental sample, also known as the microbiota, rather than in the classification of individual fragments.
 Based on six real graph datasets, we compared the performance of our propose framework with that of other competitive DL algorithms.
 Thus based on our analysis, it should not be surprising that deep networks trained on image datasets show poor performance under input perturbations and (in general) input distribution shifts as discussed in numerous recent papers (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019; Jo & Bengio, 2017; Geirhos et al., 2018b;a).
 Even some work (Karimireddy et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2019) exploits δ ≤ 1 to replace k/d in (3), they also fail to identify exact δ to distinguish Topk and Randk.
 Based on the optimal transport theory, the proposed ER-Classifier minimizes the discrepancy between the distribution of the true label and the distribution of the framework output, thus only retaining important features for classification in the embedding space.
 We answer this question through extensive theoretical and experimental studies and show how network width, depth, batch normalization and skip connections affect the dynamics.
 For instance, on ImageNet, UDA leads to improvements of top-1 accuracy from 58.84 to 68.78 with 10% of the labeled set and from 78.43 to 79.05 when we use the full labeled set and an external dataset with 1.3M unlabeled examples.

 The game has a generative model G and a imitation model D.
 Moreover, generalizing spectral embeddings to unseen data points, a task commonly referred to as out-of-sample-extension (OOSE), is a non-trivial task (Bengio et al., 2003; Belkin et al., 2006; Mendoza Quispe et al., 2016).

In the other way of constructing the hierarchical policy learning, as shown in work (Kulkarni et al., 2016; Das et al., 2018b), the sub-goal space could be designated from human knowledge with semantic meaningful terms.
 To further complicate the issue, the number of parameters in transformer-based networks is quadratic in relation to the fixed input size.
 Our results suggest the potential of utilizing NODEs for solving the contour evolution of level set methods or the direct evolution of image embeddings into segmentation maps.

 In Section 2, we illustrate our designs of GNN architectures for embedding 2QBF formulas.
 Further, in methods which use other models to provide logits/labels, often the parent network used to provide those labels is trained using an alternate objective function or needs to be fully re-trained on the current dataset, both of which introduce additional computation.
 We also perform ablation studies to confirm the novelty of our method.
 Different from the ensemble methods proposed in previous works, our method is capable of generalizing to unseen transitions with only one dynamic model because merely incorporating multiple models does not alter the essence that one-step (or few-step) supervised learning fails to imitate the distribution of multi-step rollouts.
 In this way, the locality in the sequence is explicitly captured.
Our main contributions are:
We find that both sparse and non-sparse models are brittle and sensitive to ImageNet-A and C, and that this brittleness is amplified at highers level of sparsity (Table 7).
 Recently, Houthuys & Suykens (2018) used this framework to develop tensor-based multi-view classification models and Schreurs & Suykens (2018) showed how kernel PCA fits into this framework.
 With the inner conditional query mechanism, the learning process becomes fully observable MDP, which makes the problem easier to apply the reinforcement learning.
Based on the above observations, we propose a dual pathway generative model.
 On the other hand, if robust learning converges to a constant function, it cannot achieve natural accuracy.
 BTS operates over each single question separately, without seeing a large number of similar tasks (in order to leverage a certain homogeneity assumption).

 We can then use q as a proposal distribution inside a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter (Doucet et al., 2000), although in this paper, we just use a single posterior sample, as is common with Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs, Kingma & Welling (2014); Rezende et al., (2014)).
 Our experiments show that our model can identify meaningful clusters that can be translated into actionable information for clinical decision-making.
 These techniques have proven to perform at-par with the uncompressed models, but still suffer from a number of issues.
 This partially separable training process can be achieved with the help of chordal sparsity theory (Vandenberghe & Andersen, 2015): we first decompose a large-scale sparse graph into several small dense subgraphs, and we construct a tree of which the nodes are the subgraphs.
 The intuition behind our algorithm is: by controlling the degree of adaptiveness, the base learning rate in Padam does not need to be as small as other adaptive gradient methods.
 This technique may be of independent interest for other problems.
 Unlike object detection networks, which are trained to detect object categories, Siamese trackers are trained to detect the object using the provided template in a video sequence.

 We can then flexibly and recursively combine multiple energy functions via these operators.
 In this work, we propose a method which leverages the distribution mapping capabilities of generative models, but unlike other distribution mapping outlier detection methods we no longer conveniently assume that outliers are not well mapped to the enforced prior distribution.
Our main contributions are:
 Our experiments on MNIST and Cifar-10 show that the method achieves better performance, which verifies our theoretical findings.
 It is evident that the loss functions become more and more complicated.
 We leverage the FGSM mechanism (Goodfellow et al., 2014) to evaluate the adversarial robustness on our sparse models.
Since our proposed architecture is made up entirely from learnable (parameterized) graph convolutional layers, we refer to it as being fully convolutional.
 Extensive experiments on Digits Image transfer tasks and synthetic-to-real image transfer task demonstrate our approach can provide superior results than state-of-the-art approaches.
 This body of work can be seen as the extension of the linear averaging of models studied in (Goodfellow et al., 2014).
From a technical aspect, we develop mainly three proof technique to obtain the improved bound in Theorem 1.

 Unlike Priority Experience Replay (PER) (Schaul et al., 2015), a popular non-uniform sampling scheme for the Atari environments, ERE is only a few lines of code and does not rely on any sophisticated data structures.
 However, its critical limitation is the absence of the encoder f(x) for carrying inference on real images.
 Our experiments demonstrate the usefulness of our extraction method, and show its regularizing effect.
 Nevertheless, it can not leverage the coordinate block to accelerate convergence.

 This indicates similar level of realism and diversity between the generated and the real examples, as shown in Figure 1a.
 First, the MIS problem is impossible to approximate in polynomial time by a constant factor (unless P=NP) (Hastad, 1996), in contrast to (Euclidean or metric) TSP which can be approximated by a factor of 1.
 Our empirical evaluation shows that the currently existing methods are not well equipped to handle this scenario.
 For the particular setting of robustness, X-regularization applied to adversarial training takes the form of robust self-training (RST) that was recently proposed in (Carmon et al., 2019; Najafi et al., 2019; Uesato et al., 2019).
Following that spirit, the Meta-Dataset, a collection of 10 datasets, was recently proposed as a harder and more realistic few-shot classification benchmark (Triantafillou et al., 2019).
 Also our methods increase little overhead in computational efforts.
 Interestingly, LAP corresponds to a average pooling layer for CNNs, named box filtering (Szeliski, 2010).
 Rather than analyzing trade-offs of these objectives by hand, one of the keys of multi-objectivization is letting the agent learn the relationship among these objectives and understand the purpose of the task see Figure 1(c).
By applying the above, we advance the state of the art for MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR10, significantly improving upon the privacy/accuracy tradoffs from prior work.

 It has recently been demonstrated that some graph CNN architectures can be greatly simplified, and still perform competitively on several graph analysis tasks (Wu et al., 2019).
 On the other hand, STDP performs unsupervised local learning and extracts low-level features under spatial correlation.
 This corroborates the notion that as long as the true function class is not found, it is best to ensure that training and test distribution are close.
 The local content around each pixel is represented by a high dimensional vector.
 We also employ differing constraint settings to validate our constrained agents and produce new stylistic effects with a single trained model.

 Real-world domains may have millions of event types, including many rare types.
 While most lossy compression schemes do not provide convergence guarantees, QSGD’s quantization scheme, is designed to be unbiased, which implies that the quantized stochastic gradient is itself a stochastic gradient, only with higher variance determined by the dimension and number of quantization levels.
 In particular, we make the following contributions:
 Long-term memory storage is believed to rely on semantic encoding that performs better if it can be associated with existing contextual knowledge (Lepage et al., 2000; Murdock, 1982).
 In this situation, the hidden state size necessary to encode the entire sequence could be much larger than the minimal hidden state size necessary to solve the problem.
 The third approach is similar to the second one, except that the ordering is computed through self-attention.

 This is up to our knowledge the first attempt to solve the problem of unsupervised video completion using general ML methods.
 While the choices of the body and head architectures may appear like complex new hyperparameters we introduce, we will see in the experiments that we get good results by simply taking the N −k, 0 ≤ k N , layers of the original ensemble members for the body and duplicating the layer for the heads.
 The reason is that challenges presented by the selected environments are the dominating factor driving difficulty of the task (in fact, answering the question of whether a Sokoban level is solvable is NP-hard, see e.g, Dor & Zwick (1999)).
 Our contributions are as follows:
 Recently, GCN has been widely used in numerous applications to capture the interaction in the sample level, such as recommendation (Wang et al., 2019; Ying et al., 2018).
 It can be observed that the brighter parts of the flow loss in fig.  1 (c) align with the attention areas (Greydanus et al., 2018) in fig.  1 (d), implying the significance of motion features in intrinsically motivated exploration.
 Then a graph (WCVG) is built upon the frame and visualsemantic representations as nodes and introduces another level of attention between them.
 QM9 (Blum & Reymond, 2009; Montavon et al., 2013) is one such dataset containing 134K molecules using carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and fluorine atoms.
 Based on this observation, in addition to unfolding RwISTA as a feedforward network, we recast the reweighting process into a parameterized reweighting block that can inference the inherent dependencies between coefficients and thus promote structures.
We highlight three contributions of our approach as follows:
 Since the source data are evenly split, we guide the algorithm to minimize the information gain between the source and target domain, which encourages even split of the target data also.
 The result of the transformers in LSTM is a new hidden state h(i).
 These constant-loss permutations are possible because each permutation point lies in a high-dimensional plateau of critical points.
 In this way, teacher network in our method instructs student network on how to get the “answer”, rather than just give an intermediate representation for mimicking as in previous methods.

 Just like ”the goal is to capture the other player’s king” does not fully specify the rules of chess, Equation 1 does not fully specify a game between the two players.
 Specifically, we exploit Wasserstein divergence (W-distance) to measure the difference between the distribution of any layer and the target distribution.
In summary,
 For instance, consider a document that has no links to others and hence it is impossible to do feature smoothing with node relations.
 By computing the minimum adversarial perturbation on the complementary set of features that can alter the model\\u2019s decision, we could test the degree of importance of the set.
 It was only applicable to synthetic images, where the background mask is available and produced only black and white images.
 In our proposed method, these negative samples are obtained from the currently trained VAE model itself by utilizing the generated samples.
 However, these methods give inferior performance as compared to methods with large storage capacity.
 Our experiments are not meant to compete with what is happening in the ANN world.
 This allows us to pose the disentanglement problem as a metric-learning problem: we aim to learn a transformation of the contextualized representation, which is invariant to changes in the lexical semantics within each group of structurally-similar sentences (§3.3).
Inspired by these works mentioned above, we can present a theoretical explanation for spectral bias.
 We summarize the main contributions as follows:
 Consequently, f can be written as a continuous, piecewise affine operatorf(x) = AQ(x)x+ bQ(x) = Ax x+ bx.
To tackle this problem, we propose a novel RL framework, called clustered reinforcement learning (CRL), for efficient exploration in RL.
 A set of noisy labels, as well as the knowledge of the noises, are often assumed to be known.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
 The pseudo-labels are then used to learn a similarity function for the unlabelled images.
 However, they do not provide a rigorous theoretical analysis for the effect of applying the minimum operator.
 We therefore propose DeepHoyer, which is the first Hoyer-inspired regularizers for DNN sparsification.
 Compared with regularization, constraints do not encourage the weights to stay in a small neighborhood of the initial weight, see Chapter 7.
 To quantify such pairwise structural information, we draw inspiration from recent study of graph curvature (Ollivier, 2009; Lin et al., 2011; Weber et al., 2016).
 It can be noted that the approximation is not straightforward for DPP, thus cannot fully deliver the diversity property (e.g, resulting in rank-deficiency).
We evaluate AdVIL in various undirected generative models, including restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) (Ackley et al., 1985), deep Boltzmann machines (DBM) (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009), and Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machines (GRBM) (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006), on several real datasets.
 As shown in Figure 1, the bitwidth of accumulators can be reduced to 16-bit.

 Instead of putting all operators in one actionpool, we separate heuristic operators into two classes, namely improvement operators and perturbation operators.
 The HLC and LLC simultaneously learn by trials and errors, i.g,, penalizing inference accuracy loss while rewarding a smaller QBN.
In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network called the sequential variational soft Q-learning network (SVQN), which integrates the learning of hidden states and the optimization of the planning within the same framework.
 Finally, Section 3.4 tests the implicit regularization hypothesis on CoinRun, as well as ablates various ImageNet architectures and margin metrics in the Appendix.
 Without retraining the original CNN, our distribution classifier improves the performance of transformation-based defenses on both clean and adversarial images.
 Consequently, it assigns inordinate quantization levels for a tiny range around the mean.
 It is noteworthy that the same idea of Lazy-CFR can also be applied to CFR+, and we name the resulted algorithm Lazy-CFR+.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a generic definition for knowledge consistency between two pre-trained DNNs, and we develop a method to disentangle consistent feature components from features of intermediate layers in the DNNs.
 One immediate implication is that we can use deterministic policies, unlike policy gradients which is based on stochastic policies.

 Conventional GANs and VAEs model the gradient map directly and encounter the trouble of discontinuity.
 Different from most existing LNL approaches, DivideMix discards the sample labels that are highly likely to be noisy, and leverages the noisy samples as unlabeled data to regularize the model from overfitting and improve generalization performance.
 Therefore, we raise the following questions:Are the adversarial examples generated from i) misclassified and ii) correctly classified examples, equally important for adversarial robustness? If not, how can one make better use of the difference to improve robustness?In this paper, we investigate this intriguing, yet thus far overlooked aspect of adversarial training, and find that misclassified and correctly classified examples exhibit a distinctive influence on the final robustness.
 In this case our convergence rate also matches the well-known convergence rate for the Nesterov’s method (15; 4).
 Overall, we show that a very small amount of supervision is enough to reliably learn disentangled representations as illustrated in Figure 1.
 It turns out that folds carry a lot of information about the parameters of a network, so much in fact, that some networks are uniquely identified (up to permutation and scaling) by the function they implement.
 We base our experiments on an extensive collection of alternatives, including a pool of 12 data sets, two conceptually-different generative models, increasing model sizes, and three variants of complexity estimates.
 Our model augments a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a memory bank, which is a set of distributed, real-valued vectors capturing domain knowledge.
 We also find that, despite visible effects of long term dependencies, the context aggregated into the hidden embeddings is mostly local.
 In Figure 1, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) on the action sequences generated in each planning iteration within one time-step.
 In addition to word frequency, we assess word importance with respect to a specific class.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:
In summary, our main contributions are:
 These early approaches required many queries to fine-tune the classifier for different target networks, which may not be practical for real applications.
 This suggests potential ways to improve a classifier or to combine aspects of multiple classifiers.
 It is noteworthy that there still exists a considerable gap between the state-of-the-art algorithm and the theoretical lower bound (Lattimore & Hutter, 2012) regarding 1/(1− γ) factor.
 Moreover, they construct coresets of weights, while our approach constructs coresets of neurons.
 Based on the partition, we discover a degenerate nature of the large amounts of local minima from the following aspects:• Every local minimum is globally minimal within a cell.
 Other synchronization policies (see in Section 2) may either degenerate to the above mentioned three policies or may need extensive manual tuning of hyper-parameters.
However, none of the above works explicitly leverage the fact that an agent’s different actions may have different impacts on other agents, which is a natural property in MASs and should be considered in the decision-making process.
 This allows us to compare the Pose2Frame network directly with recent video-to-video solutions.
 To address the first challenge, we estimate simultaneous confidence intervals of the label probabilities via the Clopper-Pearson method and Bonferroni correction in statistics.
 This effect will only be amplified by intrinsic reward.

 This insight provides a geometric interpretation of the “no free lunch” hypothesis in adversarial robustness (Tsipras et al., 2019; Dohmatob, 2018; Bubeck et al., 2019).
 That being said, a federated setting involving per-user personalization (Chen et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2017) is a natural meta-learning application.
The second option is an embedding-based model that jointly embeds queries and documents in the same embedding space and use an inner product or cosine distance to measure the similarity between queries and documents.
 Our method outputs multistep expert-like plans, offering superior interpretability to one-step imitation learning models.
 This make existing analysis inappropriate to our case, and we provide a new recipe to prove the convergence of this new optimizer.
 We further verify that BQNs can be easily used to compress (Bayesian) neural networks and obtain determinstic QNNs.
 We consider two different workloads, 1) simulation time is roughly equivalent for all environments, and 2) simulation time can vary dramatically due to large differences in environment complexity.
 As a concrete example, consider a self-driving car that uses a deep neural network to predict the path that a pedestrian might take.
 The difference between our model and Shaw et al., (2018) is also obvious, where Shaw et al., (2018) is based on Bayesian inference but our model is based on gradient-based meta-learning.
 Although one can approximate higher-dimensional convolution by 1D convolution, the approximation error is inevitable.
 These empirical results, in turn, corroborate our hypothesis that neural networks (with nonlinear activation) are locally elastic.
 Now, the overall gradient isg = ga + gb = ga1 + 2 gab + gb1 .
Next, we tackle the problem of prohibitive computation time.
 Our model includes a two-stage decoding process: (1) the first decoder learns relevant signals from the input dialogue history and generates a fertility for each input slot representation; and (2) the predicted fertility is used to form a structured sequence which consists of multiple sub-sequences, each represented as (slot token×slot fertility).
 Let us denote hidden state sequence as hm ∈ RD and input sequence xm ∈ Rd. For m = 1, 2, . , T , and a suitable β > 0τ ġ(t) = −α(g(t)± hm−1) + φ(U(g(t)± hm−1) +Wxm + b), g(0) = 0, t ≥ 0 (3) hm , h β·τ m , g(β · τ)Intuitively, say system is in equilibrium and−α(µ(xm, hm−1))+φ(Uµ(xm, hm−1)+Wxm+b) = 0.

 We summarize our main contributions as follows:
Our approach is not a direct replacement for current inference methods on few-variate spatial point processes (Jalilian et al., 2015).
Our code and data are publicly available.
 To incorporate these advantages, we: (i) Extend the Robust Bellman operator (Iyengar, 2005) to robust and soft-robust entropy-regularized versions, and show that these operators are contraction mappings.
 (c) Task 2 is learned using higher learning rates for previously uncertain parameters (W3 and W4, W5) while learning rates for W1 and W2 are moderated according to their predicted low uncertainty after finishing task 1.
 On the other hand, the 0-1 loss treats each training sample equally.
 Next, we show that, in combination with monotonic activation functions, all layers from the second layer on realize monotonically increasing functions.
 The layer is based on graph networks (GN) as it easily leverages structural features to learn the localized representations and share the parameters for computing the localized features.
 This prevents a categorical sequence generation model from being deployed to low-power devices.
 To make the analysis more tractable, we define J(µ) = supϕ J (µ, ϕ), so that (1) becomes simplyinf θ J(µθ).
 In such settings, nodes benefit from a larger range (i.g,, neighborhood, hence a deeper GNN) to “recover” effective feature representations.
 Our main contributions are:
 In contrast to previous approaches which do not address this aspect, SymODEN has been designed to work with angle data in the embedded form.
 The MSP algorithm in equation 3 is to find the fixed point(s) of this map.
But how should one design the model? We cannot directly use location as a label for appliance activation events.
Thus it remains an open question whether a purely neural-based end-to-end approach can achieve comparable performance to tabular based CFR approach.
 In contrast, p1(x∗) contains overlapping buttons while in pn(x∗), only the left button was resized.
 Control is fine-grained, with a strength parameter determining how strong the attribute influence should be; a strength of 0 fully recovers the original model p(x).
 Figure 1 shows the generation results from the proposed models.
 To facilitate that, we propose a metric to quantify the hardness of few-shot episodes and a way to systematically report performance for different few-shot protocols.
 Our paper forges a connection between two literatures that have evolved mostly independently: knowledge distillation and representation learning.
 The harder samples augmented by adversarial policies are constantly fed into the target network to promote robust feature learning.
 Figure 1 depicts such a scenario where the noise generator perturbs each input instance to help the model predict better decision boundaries.
Among in-processing methods, many add a regularization term or constraints to promote statistical independence between the classifier output and the sensitive attributes.
 In contrast, previous works mainly focus on pair matching problems (Li et al., 2019; Galichon & Salanié, 2010) — the extreme case of subset correspondence when the subset sizes are 1.
 We elaborate on our method in Section 4 as well as providing a comprehensive ablation study.
 Details of all our measures and hyperparameter selections are provided in Appendix D.
 Previous works (Zhang et al., 2018; Weng et al., 2018; Ko et al., 2019) have to track all such dependency and thus is costly in time and memory.

 We train a graph neural network (Battaglia et al., 2018) to take a computation graph as input and output node-specific proposal distributions to use in the mutant generation step of BRKGA’s inner loop.
 At the same time, hierarchical and modular design and use of analytical planning, significantly cuts down the search space during training, leading to better performance as well as sample efficiency.
 In the general case, EMPIR comprises of M full-precision models and N low-precision models with the final prediction determined by an ensembling technique such as averaging the probabilities or counting the number of predictions for each class.
The impact and potential of our approach is studied on two datasets in which respectively rotation and scale equivariance plays a key role: cancer detection in histopathology slides (PCam dataset) and facial landmark localization (CelebA dataset).
 Our results indicate that the next sentence prediction objective actually hurts the performance of the model while identifying the language in the input does not affect B-BERT’s performance crosslingually.
 Additionally, an augmented Lagrangian penalty method is used to enforce constraints on state and control input.

 We leverage inductive logic programming (ILP) technique to derive an efficient task inference method based on the principle of maximum likelihood.
With extensive experiments, we demonstrate using diverse datasets that our method effectively improves autoencoder-based novelty detection methods.
The key contributions of our work include:
 Since the pruned atomic blocks have little contribution to the network output due to their negligible weights, the final network does not need to be retrained or finetuned.
 In general, these estimators are often noisy and can lead to unstable training due to their dependence on the discriminator used to estimate the bounds of mutual information.
 For language modeling, it achieves 3.8 lower perplexity than the transformer around 500M Mult-Adds.
 Our precise characterization applies to an architecture with unregularized bias terms (as in Savarese et al., (2019)) and a single unregularized linear unit— otherwise a correction accounting for a linear component is necessary, similar but more complex than the term |f ′(−∞) + f ′(+∞)| in the univariate case, i.g,, (1).
The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.
 So we have to add a global constraint to align the states in demonstration and imitation.
 Our learning-based agglomerative clustering framework deviates drastically from the prevailing deep segmentation pipelines and makes one step towards generalizable part discovery in unseen object categories.
 For example, in fig.  1, “stop sign” of the original image caption is changed to “cat sitting” and “umbrella is” for cAdv and tAdv respectively.
 In extensive ablation studies, we show that it works across a large range of GAN variants and datasets.
 We also observe that the sequential object processing in SQAIR, which is based on an RNN, not only increases the computation time but also deteriorates discovery performance.

Our main contributions are summarized as follows.
 The limited prior work on side-channel attacks against DL systems assumed knowledge of the architecture family of the victim DNN (Yan et al., 2018; Duddu et al., 2018); therefore, these attacks are only able to extract variants of generic architectures, such as VGG (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015) or ResNet (He et al., 2016).
 As we will see later, a näıve composition of the two methods could have a disastrous impact on the accuracy of a pruned CNN transferlearned on the target dataset.
 To demonstrate this, we take GCNs defined on the Erdős – Rényi graph GN,p, which has N nodes and each edge appears independently with probability p, for an example.
 Specifically, our objective is to maximize the mutual information between the representations of entire graphs and the representations of substructures of different granularity.
 In particular, our main contributions are:
 Nevertheless, the hyper-parameters of the feature-wise transformation layers may require meticulous hand-tuning due to the difficulty to model the complex variation of the image feature distributions across various domains.
 Instead, we focus on identifying synaptic importance parameters that preserve the ‘distribution’ of the latent representation of a task.
 These results help to justify the design of our algorithm in using BER instead of the marginal error as our loss functions.
 This causes the ground truth for the DoS of a product entering at a given time to be ill-defined.
Given the connection between AC-GNNs and WL on the one hand, and that between WL and FOC2 on the other hand, one may be tempted to think that the expressivity of AC-GNNs coincides with that of FOC2.

 Along with a similar direction, Baykal et al., (2019) proposed a pruning scheme called Corenet and derived a bound of the size of the compressed network.
 In (Wu et al., 2018), the authors focused on stochastic gradient descent (SGD), defined a criterion to evaluate the stability of a specific minimum and used this criterion to show how the learning rate and batch-size play a role in SGD minima selection process.
 Concretely, our representation is based on products of a particular building block known as a butterfly matrix (Parker, 1995; Dao et al., 2019); we term such products kaleidoscope matrices (K-matrices for short).
 In such cases, the representation ability of MPNNs may be limited significantly, since they cannot capture the important features from distant but informative nodes.
 However, their theory fails to cover FedAvg.
 The proposed data-dependent Gaussian prior objective (D2GPo) is then injected into the final loss through a KL divergence term.
 The heuristics that are currently used in practice are either inspired by the corresponding dual problem when verification is formulated as an optimization problem (Bunel et al., 2018; Royo et al., 2019) or incorporating the gradient information of the neural network (Wang et al., 2018b).
 Here, instead of the full Q matrix, SV-RL naturally focuses on the “sub-matrix”, corresponding to the sampled batch of states at the current iteration.
 Furthermore, the feed-forward model can be fitted by directly optimizing the loss that one is interested in.
To address these challenges, we propose to leverage and transpose recent intrinsically motivated learning algorithms, within the family of population-based Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (POP-IMGEPs - denoted simply as IMGEPs below, Baranes & Oudeyer (2013); Péré et al., (2018)).
 Additionally, we test the impact of cascading layer-wise weight randomizations on the attribution heatmaps (Adebayo et al., 2018).

In this paper, we have three major contributions.
 This is the first time that a stochastically controlled function has been incorporated into the process of estimating the inner function.
 Our contributions are as follows:
 Consequently, if we use the default sample weighting in categorical cross entropy (CCE) where harder samples obtain higher weights, anomalies tend to be fitted well especially when a network has large enough capacity.
 To our knowledge, the first time data augmentation and explicit regularization were systematically contrasted was the preliminary study by Hernández-García & König (2018b).

 This method improves the accuracy of our meta neural network by a factor of 3.
 Crucially, there exists a one-to-many map from c to the space of observations, and there are other unobserved attributes z (or noise) that together completely define x.
 This leads to a new algorithm we call Generative Latent Flow (GLF), which combines a deterministic auto-encoder that learns a mapping to and from a latent space, and a normalizing flow that matches the standard Gaussian to the distribution of latent variables of the training data produced by the encoder.
 Finally, for all new sequences, we compose them along the temporal direction in a sequential order.
 We believe that compared with the abstract semantic information that is extracted by a deep network, the detailed information of the spatial structure is more important to improving the stereo matching accuracy.

 The cardinality of S is |S|.
 While each node of the logit is confined to represent its assigned class probability which does not change drastically over iterations, at the feature map-level, much more flexibility comes into play, which makes the problem more challenging.

Groueix et al., (2018); Li et al., (2019) by adding prior knowledge helping generating target data, Zhao et al., (2018) applied this learned prior to the generation of discrete data, and then Achlioptas et al., (2018) adopts the idea of adversarial in latent space, but the specific approach is completely different.
 Also, previous models usually utilize the recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
 Recently Thomas et al., (2014); Bendale & Boult (2016); Dhamija et al., (2018) have proposed extreme value theory (EVT) based open set recognition to bound the open-space risk and balance it with recognition errors in deep neural networks.

 The multi-pass QA model proposed in Li et al., (2019) alleviates these issues by incorporating a pre-trained language model, BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), which eschews recurrence for self-attention.
 In one-shot NAS, instead of evaluating several candidate architectures, a single “base” neural network model is pre-trained; a class of sub-networks is identified (called the search space) and the performance of each sub-network is evaluated on a validation set; and the best-performing sub-network is finally selected and fine-tuned.
 However, the work (Zhang et al., 2018; Subramanya et al., 2018) showed that under certain conditions, generating an attack (which we call interpretability sneaking attack, ISA) that fools the classifier as well as its coupled interpreter (in terms of keeping interpretability map highly similar to that of benign input) is not significantly more difficult than generating adversarial inputs deceiving the classifier only.
 We then will illustrate how different levels of features reside in the same feature space.

 Thus, we call our additional third network a noise-prior (NP) network.
 However, their method is a constructive approach, where each state is a partial TSP tour, and each action adds a city to increase the partial tour, until forming a complete tour.
 This compounds extrapolation error, making BRL even more difficult.

 For example, as shown in fig. 1, the VGGNet (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) equipped with CE is able to effectively prevent inhibited channels and achieves channel equalization in various of “Norm+RelU-like” blocks, consistently improving their recognition performance.
Although the above “trick” allows us efficiently perform inference and learning, we find that in challenging problems (e.g, when the dynamical model p(zt|zt−1,vt) is very flexible), the model ignores the discrete latent variables, and does not perform mode switching.
First, embedding compression models (Shi & Yu, 2018; Chen et al., 2018; Khrulkov et al., 2019; Shu & Nakayama, 2017), require two hyper-parameters to be fine-tuned.
 Note that two subgraphs are adjacent in the tree if they share some vertices.
 Therefore, it can maintain a larger learning rate while preventing the gradient explosion.
The idea for proving global convergence is as follows.
 These networks are trained end-to-end on video datasets on a per-frame detection loss.
 The architecture search problem is decoupled from the supernet training and addressed in a separate step.
 The former takes the hidden feature maps in black-box classifiers as inputs, and the latter guides the outputs with expected distributions as relevance scores.
• Unification of compute and storage.
 Hundreds of iterations are required to solve the CSC problem in each step.
 Poloczek et al., (2016) built a joint statistical model of the collection of related objective functions.
 • Cooling a glass.
Assumption 2.
 Moreover, reducing input resolution does not necessarily harm the performance, and may sometimes even be beneficial.
 An uncertainty based acquisition function is modeled to select the samples state-action pairs for querying the implicit human feedback.
 Indeed, we will see in Sections 3 and 4 that the same GAN data that leads to improved TSC leads to degraded accuracy when used to augment the original supervised learning training set.
 To handle spatial unsmoothness, we develop a novel Clustered Graph Attention Network (CGAT) by leveraging different graph attention kernels on different regions.
 More complex operators (such as implication) can be formed out of our base operators.
 Our core idea instead is to design a novel prior probability-weighted loss function that actively encourages outliers to be mapped to low probability regions in the latent space.
Our contributions are in three folds.
 But it is still unclear why these complicated losses are effective and how does the pair mining methods affect the overall loss within a mini-batch.
 We present several approaches to overcome this such as good learning schedules and gradient clipping.
 This paper makes the following contributions:
 We present our proposed method in Section 3, extensive experiment results and analysis in Section 4 and conclusion in Section 5.
 In fact, concurrent with our work, Singh & Jaggi (2019) applied neuron alignment to model averaging.
 Firstly, we introduce a notion of a fundamental domain to handle invariance of functions and evaluate the complexity of the domain (Lemma 1).
 Our results show that VAE with RealNVP prior consistently outperforms standard VAE and RealNVP posterior.
 The refinement iterations have to be repeated for each posterior sample.
 We conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of each component and the proposed EVPNet.
 In addition to the standard neural network models, we also test our algorithms on attacking discrete GBDT models and detector-based defense models.
 We implemented the decision layer to perform classification or regression.
 Then, we design a corresponding RL environment to train the attacker.
 Thus, empowerment maximizes the diversity in final states Sf while learning options highly predictive of Sf (Salge et al., 2013).
 This forms the first key contribution of our paper.
In summary, our contributions are:
 We show that SOP combined with ERE out-performs SAC and provides state of the art performance.
 Effort has been made on learning an encoder for GAN under the framework of VAE, however the previous two issues of learning VAE still exist.

(1) Improved Personalized Model – for a large majority of the clients.
 Theorem 1 states that gradient descent can find an -accurate solution in terms of the expected classification error for a wide class of over-parameterized two-layer neural networks under a separability assumption using a neural tangent model.
 This perspective was used by Goodfellow et al., (2014).
All the aforementioned methods treat GAN as a black box for evaluation.
 The visual feature and semantic embedding spaces fall in the common space (top of fig. 1).
 Motivated by this observation, we introduce an additional precision-inducing loss function, which explicitly encourages the hallucinator to generate examples so that a classifier trained on them makes predictions similar to the one trained on a large amount of real examples.
5 (Christofides, 1976).
 The previous works view RST as a way to beat the sample complexity barrier of robustness.
 Among other things such as variable numbers of ways and shots, a key difficulty of the Meta-Dataset is that class semantics vary across episodes, since episodes are generated from a randomly selected dataset.
Experimentally, we find LAP significantly enhances the performance as discussed below.
 It means that, instead of applying excessive prior knowledge, a learnable weight vector will be introduced to weigh the reward function of each objective.
 Empirical attack accuracies on four different datasets confirm our theoretical claims.
 We also empirically demonstrate that SNP which simply performs attention on a lossless memory of all the past context points still underperforms the proposed model and therefore the use of imaginary context is a better design choice.
 Since the quantized gradients in most methods are an unbiased estimation of the original ones, the convergence rate of these methods has the same order of magnitude as that of DSGD, but slower due to the extra quantization variance.
 ii) In the vanilla teacher-student setup, the test error of a network is stationary during long periods of training before a sudden drop-off.
 Shallue et al., (2018) argued that one can reduce the generalization gap between small and large batch sizes if one introduces additional regularization (we note that this is consistent with the claim that stochastic gradients can enhance generalization).
 We demonstrate the applicability of our method using numerous examples (see Section 6 and Appendix).
 For a semi-definite matrix Σ ∈ Rd×d and a vector x ∈ Rd, ‖x‖Σ = √ x>Σx denotes the Mahalanobis norm.
 We find that simulating participants’ behavior using fictitious play closely agrees with the Nash equilibrium prediction, 2 and our framework identifies a contest design near the optimal design prescribed by the economic equilibrium analysis.
 Since weakly and strongly annotated training data is shared between the tasks, part of the annotations are missing, especially for task 3.
Tail labels: It is worth noting that all the computational and statistical complexity in extreme classification arises due to the presence of millions of tail labels each having just a few, often a single, training point.
 An event occurs every day at 10AM, representing some background process that is important for the system.
 More recently, (Child et al., 2019) have pushed on using strided self-attention to achieve high-quality unconditional samples of ImageNet building upon successes of (Parmar et al., 2018) and (Menick & Kalchbrenner, 2018).
 Particularly, stochastic variational inference (Hoffman et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2018) has successfully enabled scalable learning and inference for deep generative models (DGMs) on a vast amount of unlablled data.
 (3)It has been shown that reweighted algorithms—such as the reweighted `1 minimization method by Candès et al., (2008) and the reweighted `1-`1 minimization by Luong et al., (2018)—outperform their non-reweighted counterparts.
 More free-form parameters require more data to learn and the maximum size is still bounded.
 Previous work (Gutiérrez-Jarpaet al., 2013; Wei et al., 2019; Laporte & Pascoal, 2015; Gutiérrez-Jarpa et al., 2018) predefines corridors based on expert knowledge, and only consider to design metro lines in these corridors.
 As known, solutions to a challenging problem comes with trade-offs.
 From any subset T ⊆ S, a ground-truth rendering function r : 2S → Rn “renders” an example, i.g,, r(T ) = x.
 Based on this insight, we consider the class prediction probability as a soft combination of MCMAE classification and consider the domain discriminator as a mixture model (see Figure 1).
 The theoretical and practical contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:
 Such simple techniques have the advantage of being easier to analyze and reproduce.
 By integrating features from global (supervised training) and local (STDP) learning, the hybrid network “learns to ignore” locally uncorrelated perturbations (noise) in pixels while extracting the correct feature representation from the overall image.
 While this conclusion seems intuitive, it may often be overlooked in the hunt for more data.
 Each unit in the vector is obtained by a linear filter.
 Our findings present a methodological contribution, in the form of a useful new type of self-supervision, piecewise-linear autoencoding.
In this paper, we work with output vectors issued by BERT sentence embedding as inputs (Devlin et al., (2018)).
 To model organizational behavior, we might consider a dataset of meetings and emails in a large organization.
 As a result, Alistarh et al., (2017) are able to establish a number of theoretical guarantees for QSGD, including that it converges under standard assumptions.
 Additionally, relating classes to arbitrarily chosen environments increases the probability of encountering distinctive diagnostic features, which should help retrieval, as might be the case with human long-term memory (Nairne, 2002).
 Therefore, it is fundamental to allow the model to diverge from the orthogonality or the autoencoder solution by only imposing soft orthogonality constraints.
 All approaches treat the learnable hierarchy as part of the neural network (in conjunction with a predictive model), which is trained with a downstream task in a (semi-)supervised manner.
 We are surprised to find that the proposed sparse attention method can also help with training as a regularization method.
In this work, we propose simple and highly effective approaches to make image processing outputs more accurately recognized by downstream recognition systems, transferable among different recognition architectures, categories and tasks.
 This method is fully data driven and does not use any hand-defined analytical prior on the signal.
Summary of contributions.
 It is also in part due to this fact that a significant body of work dealing with difficult environments makes a similar assumption (see e.g, Silver et al., (2017; 2018), Orseau et al., (2018b)).
 However, although GCN can incorporate the sample interaction, yet it is difficult for GCN to deal with the sparse categorical features well.
 In addition, as exploration bonuses ideally decrease over time, the agent is motivated to continuously explore novel observations during the training phase.
 During the message-passing process, the frame nodes are iteratively updated with relational information from the visual-semantic nodes to create the final temporally-aware multimodal representations.
 However, as all molecules in this dataset are at their stable configuration, it is not suitable for designing and testing accurate energy prediction methods for unstable systems.
 To this end, a one-layer fully connected reweighting block (RW-LISTA-fc) that exploits the global dependencies of all elements is first proposed.
 The CoBRF combines the ideas, minimizing the ‘domain information gain’ between source and target data for the domain alignment while keeping the class information gain to be maximized.
 If this was the last frame in the signal (meaning i = T ), then hidden state h(T ) is passed through the fully connected layer of the neural network and, again using the abstract transformer, the final abstract shape a is obtained at the output (at the right of fig. 1).
 Our theory can be extended to higher-order saddles and provides explicit lower bounds for the number of first- and higher-order permutation points.
 It can be clearly seen from Figure 1 that our method additionally utilizes the knowledge from the teacher sub-network, compared with the previous methods.
 For instance, consider a short-text document v: apple gained its US market shares in the target domain T .
 Dropout and Batch Normalization tend to bring improvements only on off-policy algorithms.
 Our experiments show that incorporating the connectivity prior as well as the DCNN features greatly improves the algorithm performance.
 It makes discriminative class-wise distributions for each class on latent space.
 Other problems involve human priors, e.g, alphabetizing a list of names by last names, where language rules determine whether “Mary De Leon” is sorted under “D” or “L”.
 Thanks to the closed-form solution of proximal operation on a weighted `1 norm, in RPP the sparsity pattern search can be decoupled from computing the gradient of the training loss.
 First, our model learns factorized object-oriented 3D representations which are independent and modular, from a scene containing multiple objects with occlusion and partial observability rather than a single object.
 The measured latency is as large as 277ms (compared to internal latency 2us).
 Rather, we need to specify what information the players have access to, which ”moves” are allowed, and in what order are they are to be made.
 By monitoring the change of theW-distance, we are able to study both across-layer and single-layer behaviors.
 But with attribute relations, it can still learn similar feature representations as other same-class nodes.
 Although explicitly computing the importance value is NP-hard (Katz et al., 2017), Carlini & Wagner (2017) and Madry et al., (2017) showed that the perturbations computed by adversarial attacks can serve as reasonably tight upper bounds, which lead to an efficient approximation for the proposed evaluation.
 Our method works on natural images and we do not need silhouettes as supervision signal.
This paper proposes a training regime that uses the modular ScatterNet Hybrid Deep Learning (SHDL) network proposed by Singh et al (Singh & Kingsbury (2017a; 2018)) to achieve lifelong learning over two phases.
 We want to make the point that competent learning can happen in life: NNE with a single hidden layer already gives surprisingly good accuracy rates (more than 90% accuracy for classifying the MNIST digits 0 to 4).
 Under NTK regime, we establish a precise characterization for the training process of neural networks.
 We note their current intractability in high-dimensional settings and propose an approximate solution that is tractable, though the rate-distortion quality is impacted.
 (1)For the sake of brevity, we will use the simplified notation f(x) = Ax x+ bx in the sequel.
 The contributions of CRL are briefly outlined as follows:
 We do not require neither - we will self-generate the labels for unlabelled instances and learn their error rates.
 This implies that what a planning method requires is a latent reward prediction model: a model which predicts current and future rewards over a horizon from a latent state under different action sequences.
 More specifically, we make the following main contributions in this paper.
 It further leverages the entire dataset, including the filtered out erroneous samples in the unsupervised loss.
To achieve the second goal, we design a hybrid evaluator which is trained by optimizing a mixed objective function that combines both cross-entropy and RL loss.
 In this case, the bounds apply to these algorithms only with some assumptions, e.g, stationary sampling distribution.
Another important consideration refers to the design of loss function.
 We run experiments in four image-based environments – Car Racing, Pong, Breakout, and Space Invaders – and three low-dimensional environments – Humanoid, HalfCheetah, and Lunar Lander – to compare SQIL to two prior methods: BC and GAIL.
 In Section 2 we review prior work relevant to our method.
 The proposed Mutual Mean-Teaching (MMT) framework is designed to provide more reliable soft labels.
 There is also no theoretical guide for choosing the number of estimators such that the overestimation bias can be reduced to 0.
 Specifically, the contributions of this work include:
2 of Goodfellow et al., (2016) for more details.
 This extension stabilizes LLL and is particularly useful when training on a large number of tasks.
Similar to curvature in the continuous domain, e.g, the Ricci curvature of a Riemannian manifold, the discrete graph curvature measures how the geometry of a pair of neighborhoods deviates from a “flat” case, namely, the case of a grid graph.
Direct optimization.
Second, the BatchNorm (BN) layer does not necessarily need to be processed during inference for the reduction of computation and memory cost.
 We mathematically show that a ucc classifier trained on this task can be used to perform unsupervised clustering on individual instances in the dataset.
 Moreover, it is order-robust since the task-shared parameters can stay relatively static and will converge to a solution rather than drift away upon the arrival of each task.
 At each state, we choose the class first and then choose operators within the class.
 A deep recurrent neural network (RNN) (Cho et al., 2014; Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) in SVQNs is used to reduce the computational complexity, because the feature extraction can share the same weights in the RNN.
 On the MNIST dataset, the improvements in accuracy over majority voting are 1.7% and 5.9% on the clean and adversarial images respectively.
 To this end, we propose additive Powers-of-Two (APoT) quantization to resolve these two contradictions, our contribution can be listed as follows:
 The analysis on Lazy-CFR can be directly applied to Lazy-CFR+.
 Our method is task-agnostic, i.g,(1) our method does not require any annotations w.r.t the task for evaluation; (2) our method can be broadly applied to different DNNs as a supplement evaluation of DNNs besides the testing accuracy.
 Another difference is that ES uses only the total reward and not the individual state-action pairs within each episode.
 Besides, mini-batch based training with batch size B and high dimensions D would lead to O(BD|E|) making things worse.
 Comparing to the spatially or semantically local randomness introduced by Gaussian noise or image processing, x̃0 introduces spatially global and semantically diverse randomness w.r.t x0.
 That is, Pr(T = t |X=x ) 6= 0 ∀t ∈ T , ∀x ∈ X .
 In contrast, we propose to model the globally continuous Brenier potential to avoid mode collapse/mixture.

 This acceleration is illustrated in Figure 1.
 Our key contributions can be summarized as follows:
 This is the main insight of the theorem.
 The memory is retrieved by an attention mechanism during RNN information processing.
 We notice how, remarkably, this must be an effect of learning.
 The reward surface of the action space is not smooth and prone to local-minimas.
 This latter relation cannot be reliably estimated of the target class due to the scarcity of labeled data.
 Assume, at some time t, that the Hessian Ht = ∇2f(wt) has some eigenvalue smaller than − and ‖∇f(wt)‖ ≤ .
A natural defense is to fine-tune the victim against the adversary.
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
 To our knowledge, NCF is the first instance of a single model that can learn simultaneously on dynamic control-flow and data-flow tasks, setting the stage for teaching neural network models to better understand how programs execute.
 It is a non-trivial task to leverage the PL condition of a non-convex minimization objective for developing faster primal-dual stochastic algorithms to solve its equivalent non-convex concave min-max problem.
 While our approach also relies on a generator, we train it as an encoder-decoder that produces a low-dimensional embedding space.
 Though model-based algorithms have been proved to be sample efficient in various MDP settings, most state-of-the-art RL algorithms are developed in the model-free paradigm (Schulman et al., 2015; Mnih et al., 2013; 2016).
 Neural pruning reduces the size of the weight tensors, while keeping the network dense.
 This property demonstrates that the local geometry within every cell is similar to the global geometry of linear networks, although technically, they are substantially different.
 Now, the key problem addressed in this work is the following: how can we design a synchronization policy to automatically and adaptively optimize the overall training time of SGD in PS? Note that in the following, whenever we speak of “overall training time” or “time until convergence”, we specifically mean the amount of time needed until a model reaches a certain pre-defined accuracy bound on a validation dataset.
 In multiagent settings, each agent’s action set can be naturally divided into two types: one type containing actions that affect environmental information or its private properties and the other type containing actions that directly influence other agents (i.g,, their private properties).
 To address the second challenge, we propose an algorithm to solve the equation to obtain a lower bound of the certified radius, where the lower bound can be tuned to be arbitrarily close to the true certified radius.
To ensure optimism in unvisited, novel state-action pairs, we introduce Optimistic Pessimistically Initialised Q-Learning (OPIQ).
To better exploit the generic representation, we pre-train VL-BERT at both large visual-linguistic corpus and text-only datasets1.
 Used as a generic drop-in replacement of rigid kernels, DKs achieve empirical results coherent with our developed theory.
The contributions of this work are as follows.
 Tuning is extremely time-consuming, thus avoiding it is beneficial, whenever possible.
 Compared to this proposal, our approach (introduced independently in (Besserve et al., 2018b)) is more flexible as it applies to arbitrary continuous transformations, free from the strong requirements of representation theory (see Appendix F).
 We also demonstrate that CLN2INV is able to learn complex, real-world loop invariants with combinations of conjunctions and disjunctions of multivariable constraints.
 Even when we assume that age classes are linearly ordered, the proposed age estimator performs well.
The contributions of our paper are two-fold.
 As a particular selection mechanism, we adopt attacks in adversarial supervised learning (Madry et al., 2017) to attacks to the latent representation.
Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our approach.
 Indeed, we show that providing the degree can be beneficial in terms of performances, and it has also implications in the number of GNN layers needed to reach good results.
 (Our proof also borrows ideas from the analysis of the fully connected case, especially (Bartlett et al., 2017; Neyshabur et al., 2018).) Covering bounds may be applied to obtain a huge variety of generalization bounds.
 We use ‖ · ‖ to denote the `2-norm and ‖ · ‖∞ the infinite norm.
 Hence, the Softmax layer basically computes the softmax operation over the linear combination of activation vector.
 Our approach can be interpreted from both “passive” and “active” perspectives:
 We release2 the programming language, runtime environment, distributed search infrastructure, machine learning models, and training data from our experiments so that they can be used for future research.
 Highly diverse images conditioned on the same input are achieved by jointly sampling of filters in multiple stochastic convolutional layers.
Our main findings are:

 Tu et al., (2018) provide an adaptive random gradient estimation algorithm that balances query counts and distortion, and introduces a trained auto-encoder to achieve attack acceleration.
 We verify our findings with state-of-the-art models on ImageNet (image classification), Kinetics (video classification), MS COCO (object detection and instance segmentation), and Cityscapes (semantic segmentation).
 When these complexities are small for each training example, we can obtain convergence rates faster than 1/ √ n.
 We also provide technical explanations for the high correlation observed between the robustness loss and the largest eigenvalue of the input Hessian matrix on the path.
More specifically, our main contributions are:
 Let the query embedding model be φ(·) and the document embedding model be ψ(·).
 Finally, we evaluate the effect of mean-field approximation in BQN, by comparing with its Monte-Carlo realizations, where no approximation is used.
 Under both workloads, we find that DD-PPO scales near-linearly.
 We require that the self-driving car avoid the pedestrian with high probability, which it can do by avoiding all possible paths in the predicted confidence set.
 The quantitative comparison with Shaw et al., (2018) can be found in Table 3.
 By representing filters as overlapping 1D segments in 1D space, FCFS performs exact convolution with compelling computational acceleration ratio, which is the product of the compression ratio for convolution and the first spatial size of filter.
 See the description of the algorithm in Section 3 and experimental results in Section 4.
Observe that the gradient is stronger in the direction that simultaneously helps both examples and thus the corresponding parameter changes are bigger than those those that only benefit only one example.
 In standard neural networks, the computation grows as a function of the size of the input, instead of the complexity of the problem being learnt.
 The result sequence is used as input to the second decoder to generate all the tokens of the target dialogue state at once.
 We note state transitions are marginal changes from previous states, namely, hm = µ(xm, hm−1)− hm−1.
 We demonstrate a number of performance improvements over existing defense algorithms, such as finetuning or adversarial retraining and defensive distillation, on both adversarial and noise robustness.
 In contrast to the classical methodology, VAE requires a large number of training data.
 In addition, we (ii) extend MPO to Robust Entropy-regularized MPO (RE-MPO) and Soft RE-MPO (SRE-MPO) and show that they perform at least as well as R-MPO and in some cases significantly better.
13245Bayesian neural networks by controlling the learning rate of each parameter as a function of its uncertainty.
 Thus, each sample does not have too much influence on the model.
 Additionally, we show that BatchEnsemble is effective in calibrated prediction on out-of-distribution datasets; and uncertainty evaluation on contextual bandits.
 The backpropagation of a scalar error signal through these layers only affects the magnitude of the error signal but does not change its sign.
 Then, the layer is followed by recurrent graph networks (RGN) to predict the temporal difference which is another core component of physics-related dynamic equations.
 Despite significant recent efforts in addressing the computation bottleneck due to a wide softmax layer (Shim et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018), for categorical sequence generation, it is so far unclear how to address the softmax computational bottleneck while at the same time providing low-variance gradient of its RL objective.
 (2)This choice corresponds to the common assumption that the discriminator is allowed to reach optimality at every training step.
In the next section, we give a brief overview of recent and related works.
 Through extensive experiments, we show that GNNs employing our PAIRNORM significantly outperform the ‘vanilla’ GNNs when deeper models are beneficial to the classification task.
 In this line of work, parameters in a wide neural net are shown to stay close to their initialization during gradient descent training, and as a consequence, the neural net can be effectively approximated by its first-order Taylor expansion with respect to its parameters at initialization.
Notice that the orthonormal constraint A ∈ O(n;R) in equation 2 can be viewed as enforcing the orthogonality of n unit vectors simultaneously.
 People can be next to an appliance but neither activate it nor interact with it.
Automatically obtaining real-world datasets An important advantage of our approach is that we reduce the problem of selecting which program generalizes well to the simpler task of deciding which output is correct.
 These twoconflicting properties are handled by triple sampling.
 Therefore, the common practice of using optimization schedules derived from ImageNet training cannot guarantee good performance.
 This design allows vast flexibility: users can combine a state-of-the-art generative model, which may be large and difficult to train, with any number of attribute controllers.
 As such, our model can generate RGBD images from arbitrary viewpoints without any supervision, and therefore we regard this as “unsupervised 3D representation learning” though a single output cannot represent a full 3D scene.
 This connection allows us to leverage strong methods from representation learning to significantly improve the SOTA on knowledge distillation.
In the remaining sections, we will explain our model in the context of existing work and propose the learning framework for meta-dropout.
 To do that, various independence proxies such as mutual information Kamishima et al., (2011), false positive/negative rates Bechavod & Ligett (2017), equalized odds Donini et al., (2018), Pearson correlation coefficient Zafar et al., (2015; 2017), Hilbert Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) Pérez-Suay et al., (2017) were used.
 In practice, exact one-to-one matching labels are often expensive to obtain or even intractable.
 Finally, we experimentally verify the potency of BlockSwap on CIFAR-10 (Section 5) as well as ImageNet (Section 6) and COCO (Section 7).
 Training under all combination of hyperparameters and optimization resulted in a large pool of models.
 To tackle this, we introduce an efficient bound propagating process in a forward manner specially for self-attention layers, enabling the tighter backward bounding process for other layers to utilize bounds computed by the forward process.
 Let P : Rn×k → Rn×l be a permutation equivariant polynomial map.
 The regime of poor generalization of large-batch SGD, that is the use of very large overall batches (often a significant fraction of the training set size), which is known to cause drastically decreased generalization performance (Chen & Huo, 2016; Keskar et al., 2017; Hoffer et al., 2017; Shallue et al., 2018; Golmant et al., 2018).
 In its formulation, JKNet densely connects each hidden layer to the top one, hence the feature mappings in lower layers that are hardly affected by over-smoothing are still maintained.
 BRKGA is then run to completion with those input-dependent distribution choices, instead of inputagnostic default choices, to compute execution decisions.
 In practice, we find that M = 1 and N = 2 or 3 provides a significant improvement in adversarial accuracy with small overheads.
 In both cases G-CNNs out-perform their classical 2D counterparts and the added value of atrous and localized G-convolutions is studied in detail.
 Our experiments also show that character-level and word-level tokenization of the input results in significantly worse performance than word-piece level tokenization.
 This approach ensures that the hard constraints are strictly enforced if the penalty term is sufficiently large, and also guarantees that the MPC problem is feasible throughout the training process.
 It is a daunting search problem to find a good solution in a combinatorial space of programs, where evaluating a single potential solution requires running an RL algorithm for up to millions of time steps.
The mechanism our agents use to efficiently extract information from expert demonstrations is to use them in a way that guides (or biases) the agent’s own autonomous exploration of the environment.
 The optimization process is similar to the inner gradient descent in MAML, but it iterates on the unlabeled xt rather than on the labeled dlt, since it does not rely on yt to compute the true gradient.
 We show and discuss the benefits of this approach over the amortized techniques.
 To facilitate learning, we adopt an intrinsic reward inspired by upper confidence bound (UCB) that encourages efficient exploration.
 In addition, we show by evaluating on popular benchmark datasets that RAPP outperforms competing methods recently developed.
To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first theoretical formula to address IB phase transitions in the most general setting.
Training on the large supernet is computationally demanding.
 As pointed out by Poole et al., (2019), these unnormalized critic estimators of MI exhibit high variance and are challenging to tune for estimation.
Guided by our design insights, our manually-designed Lite Transformer also achieves 0.5 higher BLEU than the AutoML-based Evolved Transformer (So et al., 2019), which requires more than 250 GPU years to search, emitting as much carbon as five cars in their lifetimes (see Figure 1b).
 As we uncover, the characterization of the representational cost for multivariate functions is unfortunately not as simple as the characterization (1) in the univariate case, where the Radon transform degenerates.
 Inspired by GAIL that uses reward to align the distribution of state-action pairs, we also formulate an IRL problem whose maximal cumulative reward is the Wasserstein Distance between states of demonstration and imitation.
To summarize, we make the following contributions:
To ensure our “unrestricted" semantically manipulated images are natural, we conducted extensive user studies with Amazon Mechanical Turk.
 We also show that simply applying this technique on top of existing GAN models leads to new state-of-the-art results as measured by Frechet Inception Distance (Heusel et al., 2017).
 To this end, we propose a parallel discovery model with superior discovery capacity and performance.
 In particular, we find our defenses degrades the attacker’s query sample efficiency by 1-2 orders of magnitude.
 By allowing equivariant feature mappings to detect transformations that co-occur in the data and focus learning on the set formed by these co-occurrent transformations (i.g,, the co-occurrence envelope of the data), one is able to induce learning of more representative feature representations of the data, and, resultantly, enhance the descriptive power of neural networks utilizing them.
 The bitwidth can then be inferred from them.
 The best performance is achieved when this sampling mechanism is adversarial, i.g,, when it generates fake labels that are hard to discriminate from the true ones.
we first train a predictor network to fit a prior.
 To overcome this challenge, we also extract the approximate time each DL operation takes, in addition to the trace, and we leverage this information to estimate the architectural parameters.
 We use the weights and firing thresholds of an SNN converted from an ANN as the initialization step for spike-based backpropagation.
In this paper, to tackle the challenge of jointly transferring source knowledge and pruning target CNNs, we propose a new method based on attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), attentive feature distillation and selection (AFDS).
 We prove that if logNpN = o(1) as a function of N , any GCN whose weights have maximum singularvalues at most C √Np log(N/ε) approaches the “information-less” invariant space with probability atleast 1− ε, where C is a universal constant.
 We name our model InfoGraph.
 In light of this, we develop a learning-to-learn algorithm to optimize the proposed feature-wise transformation layers.
 Focusing on preserving the distribution of the latent representation of a neural network at an arbitrary layer, as opposed to the expected change in network’s response for individual samples, enforces a less restrict regularization on the network, and enables a better utilization of the network learning capacity.
 • Data Sparsity: A large warehouse would have significant available historical DoS data, butsuch data is scattered across thousands of products/SKUs, and different operating conditions (e.g, time of the year, day of the week, shipment size).
 However, the reality is not as simple, and there are many FOC2 node classifiers (e.g, the trivial one above) that cannot be expressed by AC-GNNs.
 Delving deeper in this line of investigation, we show that using a large learning rate is necessary to reach better-conditioned (relatively to a network without BN layers) regions of the loss surface, which was previously attributed to BN alone (Bjorck et al., 2018; Ghorbani et al., 2019; Page, 2019).
 Of the network models tested (which included ResNets and U-Nets), only our recurrent model with the full array of connections (the TD+H-CNN) solves both tasks across levels of difficulty.
 Through only a visibility-based reward function and competition, agents learn many emergent skills and strategies including collaborative tool use, where agents intentionally change their environment to suit their needs.
Hopefully, NAS-Bench-201 will show its value in the field of NAS research.
We develop an effective strategy for pre-training GNNs.
 This rule matches hundreds of instances in the unlabeled set, but could wrongly label a phrase like these restaurants.
 Suzuki et al., (2018) has developed a spectrum based bound for their compression scheme.
Here, we use dynamical stability to analyze the dynamics of A-SGD.
A straightforward strategy to address this limitation is to use a multi-layered architecture so as to receive “messages” from distant nodes.
Notation.
 The D2GPo is poles apart from the commonly adopted data-independent Gaussian prior (L2 regularization) for the purpose of smoothing the training of MLE, which is also directly added into the MLE loss.
 These heuristics normally have better computational efficiency.
 For each sampled Q matrix, we again apply ME to represent the deep Q learning target in a structured way, which poses a low rank regularization on this “sub-matrix” throughout the training process, and hence eventually the Q-network’s predictions.
Despite the above advantages of using a feed-forward model, the architecture design is challenging.
 They were initially designed to enable autonomous robots to explore and learn what effects can be produced by their actions, and how to control these effects.
 For reproducibility, we share our source code and provide an easy-to-use\\u2217 implementation.
 Further, the common use of layers that enforce local transformation-invariance, such as pooling, further limit their ability to accurately detect compositional structures by allowing for relaxations in otherwise strict spatial relations (Hinton et al., 2011).
 We show how (3.1) DRNets significantly outperformed the state of the art and human experts on Crystal-Structure-Phase-Mapping instances, recovering more precise, interpretable, and physically meaningful crystal structure pattern decompositions.
 We conduct extensive experiments on AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and VGG16 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) on SVHN (Netzer et al., 2011), CIFAR10, and CIFAR 100 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009) datasets, in which 90% pruning rate can be achieved with a marginal drop in testing accuracy.
 That is why we need to move the emphasis focus towards relatively easier ones, which serves as emphasis regularisation.
 The present work aims at largely extending that work both with more empirical results and a theoretical discussion.
 We show that stochastic gradients compute Fourier coefficients.
 Instead, the training target is directly generated by ground-truth boxes.
 When the interval degrades to 1, its topology evolves into a complete DAG.
 Under our framework, instead of directly solving δi, we update the parameter φ of g.
 Extensive experimental evaluations on both object recognition and semantic segmentation tasks clearly demonstrate the advantages of our approaches over previous state-of-the-arts (Long et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2019; Tsai et al., 2019).
 During the learning process of the agent, a discriminator learns to evaluate the mutual information between the context states and the states of interest.
 In both works, the verification is tackled by, and closely related to our direction of work, probabilistically estimating the bounds.
 For example, both the human interpretability of generated images (Le, 2013) and localist selectivity (Bowers et al., 2014) have been used to make claims about ‘grandmother cells’, but it is not clear whether they provide similar insights into unit selectivity.
 Moreover, this method tests on multiple datasets such as NMNIST, MNIST-DVS, Poker-DVS, and it reveals that BOE can significantly achieve competitive results in real-time for feature extraction and implementation time as well as the classification accuracy.
Compared with un-normalized training, we prove that normalized networks follow a modified kernel evolution that features a “length-direction” decomposition of the NTK.
 We combine the idea of both transductive and inductive approaches via associating an additive global embedding bias to each node, which can be seen as a memorable global identification of each node in training sets.
Of these two methods, the IWAE is the most popular and Tucker et al., (2019) demonstrated empirically that RWS can break down, conjecturing that this is due to the fact that RWS does not optimise a joint objective (for θ and φ).
 While runtime importance maintains the saliency of specific channels for each given specific input, the static importance captures the overall saliency of the corresponding channel among the whole dataset.
 Specifically, we, for the first time, transform the original deep neural network optimization problem into an inequality-constrained problem that can be infinitely approximate to the original one.
 On the discriminator side, we add the Sinc convolution (Ravanelli & Bengio, 2018) before the first layer to replicate the function of the parameterized low pass Sinc filter, also a popular technique in the DSP area.
 This bound presents theoretical evidence on how weightning of each graph in the training influences classification accuracy.
 The pattern complexity in realworld datasets is often intractable.
 To extract anisotropic information, we sequentially extract knowledge from the output of the network in the previous epoch to supervise the training in the next epoch.
 However, this method has two drawbacks.
 Our contributions in this work are:
 It can achieve comparable final performances but use much less training time.
 This property suggests that the invariance induction algorithm should also minimize the divergence, which is not considered on AII and possibly induce unstable behavior.
 Furthermore, we have full control over the data generation process for simulation data.
Our contributions are as follows
Despite the simplicity of our proposed method, we are able to significantly surpass prior unsupervised models quantitatively and qualitatively on both datasets.
 By leveraging the sequential composition theory in DP (Dwork & Roth, 2014), we derive a novel generalized robustness bound, which essentially is a composition of these levels of robustness (Theorem 5 and Proposition 1).
 Besides Lo’s work, many efforts have been made to connect RNN and dynamical system.
The two-stage approach has several benefits.
Our contributions are:
 In ISBNet, each node is instead simply connected to its prescribed preceding node(s) and each connection transforms via a candidate set of B operations (branches).
 On Split CIFAR, our proposed MEGA achieves an average accuracy of 66.12±1.93%, which is about 5% better than the state-of-the-art method.
 On Permuted MNIST, we show that A-GEM achieves an accuracy which is 40% lower than the original accuracy under the proposed GREV attack.
In recent years, structured pruning attracts much more attention than its unstructured counterpart - weight pruning, mainly because structured pruning doesn’t require specific circuit design and thus is more friendly to existing hardware.
 A periodically shifted attention mechanism is also used to capture the shift in the long-term periodicity.
The main contributions are described as follows.
 Splitting the latent code into unsupervised and supervised parts allows the model to separate the learning of the task-relevant features and the learning of other features that help fit the data.
 A tight generalization bound guarantees that the generalization error is small.
 Thus, the induced mask provides fine-grained interpretability and improves the final performance.
 We think the multi-input model can obtain better results because it provides more useful information.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
In summary, our contributions are:

 Sirignano & Spiliopoulos (2017) proposed a deep learning forward problem solver for high dimensional PDEs.
 Our method generates audio adversarial examples just in a few minutes while prior methods (Carlini & Wagner (2018)) take hours.
The basic idea of the exploit phase is as follows.
Through experiments, we show that the approximation error between the exact computation and its approximation rapidly converges to zero.
 Our method significantly improves the performance on benchmark classification (reduces test error from 19% to 5% on CIFAR10).
 We indeed notice this effect in practice: while the performance improves with increasing the number of heads in the beginning (Devlin et al., 2018), we notice a drop in the performance once the number of heads increases beyond a certain threshold, as seen in Table 1 and fig.  1 (see also Table 4(A) in Vaswani et al., (2017)).
 This can explain the superior performance of Adam on BERT pretraining.
 There is an extra dimension in 3-D problems, providing additional symmetries that often need to be learned (Weiler et al., 2018).
 At the task-specific distillation stage, we perform the data augmentation to provide more task-specific data for teacherstudent learning, and then re-execute the Transformer distillation on the augmented data.
 With just 200 training points, our meta neural network is able to predict the accuracy of unseen neural networks to within one percent on average on the popular NASBench dataset (Ying et al., 2019).
 For instance, if x were an image of a single object, c controls the orientation of the object relative to the camera and z could represent object identity, texture or background.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
 However, from a hodgepodge of reference segments, it is non-trivial to generate natural and meaningful behaviors.
 Based on this point of view, this paper proposes a novel structure of feature extraction network – a shallow feature extraction network.
 Also, we use graph convolution/attention layers, whose numbers of parameters do not depend directly on the number of labels.
 In this respect, we advocate for the use of selective prediction (aka rejection techniques) when the uncertainty metric is large in order to avoid potential harm or avoid risks.
 Another method is to cluster child models into groups, each of which shares a copy of weights.
 It should be noted that the MMES network is a special case of deep neural networks.
 Such architectures can be fine-tuned or retrained to achieve comparable test accuracy as the dense, over-parameterized networks.
 We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, Cifar-10, and Cifar-100.
 Our approach, named One-versus-All Invertible Neural Networks (OvA-INN), is based on an invertible neural network architecture proposed by Dinh et al., (2014).
We combine the attention-based mechanism in the professional domain image feature extraction.
 We assume that this is why the generation performance of GraphNVP is less impressive than other state-of-the-art models (Jin et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018) in the paper.
Further, since this metric is relevant to the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ), it is measurable during SGD training, in which the absolute value of weights and the random walk of weight parameters correspond to signal and noise, respectively.
 Semantics focuses on the literal content of utterances, but not on the kind of goal the speaker is trying to achieve.
 In the experiments, we will train our model on datasets with geometric transformations and analyse how different design choices influence the learned representations.
 They all exhibit so-called reward-andpenalty mechanisms in estimating the utilities of individual items.
 If A ∈ Cm×N is a matrix, then AS ∈ Cm×|S| is the column submatrix of A consisting of the columns indexed by S.
 Therefore, the direct aligning method such as using L1 or L2 distance is not suitable for online mutual feature map distillation because it updates the network parameters to generate a feature map that tries to mimic the current output feature map of the other network.
 First, to reduce the SFD in the context of SLD, it is essential to align the conditional rather than marginal feature distributions, to avoid the negative transfer effects which are caused by matching marginal feature distributions, according to a theoretical proof from Zhao et al., (2019a) (illustrated in Figure 2).
 These estimation results help us establish an approximate incentive compatibility in eliciting truthful samples.
 They first determine the noise variance at each step that meets the privacy requirement and then derive the utility guarantee by using the convergence analysis the same as in non-private case.
 We show, both empirically and analytically, that one can calibrate using this evaluation metric practically any output distribution, even one which is entirely uncorrelated with the empirical uncertainty as can be seen in fig. 1.
 If we were to fix a set of points in advance to compare for all treatments and samples then only the outcomes associated with these dosage levels would be well estimated.
Our contributions are as follows:
 Second, a low-to-high network ΦL2H is trained to produce the super resolution image.
 In particular, our findings can be summarized as follows:
 We argue that in order for an agent to be able to recover the corruptions from different scales non-locally, it requires an understanding of the context in the scene.
Contribution.
In this paper, we propose DeepReduce, a technique for cost-effective estimation of the performance of a DL model.
 Despite the fact that INNs have received very little attention in the literature in contrast to GANs, we find that cINNs can achieve comparable quality to cGANs, with some remarkable properties absent in cGANs.
 The former proposes a workflow that first learns a representation by training an AE with a compact bottleneck layer, then trains a plain GAN in that fixed latent representation.
 However, transformers (Vaswaniet al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018) have shown superior performances over RNNs on various NLP tasks, including machine translation, reading comprehension, sentiment analysis, etc.
In this work we propose a probabilistic approach to unify open set recognition with continual learning in a single deep model in order to remove or alleviate above mentioned common simplifications.
Results We compare HAL to EWC (Kirkpatrick et al., 2016), AGEM (Chaudhry et al., 2019a), experience replay (Hayes et al., 2018; Riemer et al., 2019), and MER (Riemer et al., 2019), across four standard benchmarks in continual learning (MNIST permutations, MNIST rotations, split CIFAR100, and split miniImageNet).
 In general, if the cuts are not selected appropriately, the algorithm could potentially take an exponential number of iterations; i.g,, add an exponential number of constraints.
 This differs from the notion of robustness defined by Xu & Mannor (2012) using a cover of the sample space, which has been theoretically connected to generalization.
 Often the focus is on methods that allow agents to converge on a particular, socially desirable policy, such as cooperation in social dilemmas without changing the payout structure.
The second challenge is the interpolation of knowledge about seen MDPs to perform well on unseen MDPs.
 MIL is a specific framework of supervised learning approaches.
 Specifically, our proposal, that we call Entropy Penalty is based on the IB principle and aims at learning a representation that throws away maximum possible information about the input distribution while achieving the goal of correctly predicting targets.
 The observation of gradients with Topk sparsification further enables us to propose a new computational-efficient selection algorithm for gradient which preserves the convergence property.
We compare ER-Classifier with other state-of-the-art defense methods on MNIST, CIFAR10, STL10 and Tiny Imagenet.
 In particular, following are our main contributions.
 Furthermore, our global curvature bound is differentiable and we show that adding it to the loss function as a regularizer boosts certified robustness measures.
The main obstacle to address in searching for effective multi-task architectures is the vast number of possibilities for performing feature partitioning as well as the significant amount of computation required to evaluate and compare arrangements.
 Therefore, the capabilities demonstrated in the simulated environment are hard to replicate in the real world.
 With decision tree motivations, TabNet brings sparsity-controlled soft feature selection, but individually for each instance.
 Though it is not yet clear how this limit relates to the actual training dynamics of neural networks used in practice (Chizat et al., 2019), mathematically it is an interesting regime that has inspired a lot of recent work (Arora et al., 2019a;b; Cao & Gu, 2019).
 First, we find that DNNs generalize much better on real-world noise than synthetic noise.
 Our second model is HypE, which in addition to learning entity embeddings, learns positional (convolutional) filters; these filters are disentangled from entity representations and are used to transform the representation of an entity based on its position in a relation.
Our main contributions in this work are the following.
 Furthermore, we show that gradient representation can achieve state-of-the-art performance in detecting potentially invalid data for the network.
 We evaluate the model on several aspects of human question asking, including reasoning about optimal questions in synthetic scenarios, density estimation based on free-form question asking, and creative generation of genuinely new questions.
 Besides this, in order to enhance model training, we exploit additional 28,375/29,774 formal/informal non-parallel sentences from GYAFC (Rao & Tetreault, 2018), and 53,028/53,714 offensive/non-offensive non-parallel sentences from Reddit (dos Santos et al., 2018).
 However, we observed that if we pre-train the policy, we require far fewer simulations to generate high quality trajectories.
 The main limitation of their approach is that it relies on handcrafted question templates to achieve maximum performance.
Following Hazan et al., (2017); Stobbe & Krause (2012), we model the sub-network selection as a sparse recovery problem.
 Besides investigating robustness in classification through the lens of interpretability, the work (Ghorbani et al., 2019; Dombrowski et al., 2019) studied the robustness in network interpretation maps, showing that which can significantly be manipulated via imperceptible input perturbations but keeping the classifier’s decision intact.
 Based on the above observations, we propose feature leveling network, an architectural modification on existing models that can isolate low level features from high level features within different layers of the neural network in an unsupervised manner.
 The proposed imitation training needs much less training data than the T and does not need the labels of these data, and the data do not need to coincide with the training data.
 Additionally, BERT-AL is a general NLP model which has no specific setting for text summarization, so it can be easily adapted to other tasks with long text, e.g, document-level machine reading comprehension and long text classification.
 More specialized analysis can be found in the research of Köhler et al., (2017).
To improve the diversity of predicted reactions, we incorporate latent variables into the generation process.
Our algorithm, Bayesian Residual Policy Optimization (BRPO), augments a belief-space batch policy optimization algorithm (Lee et al., 2019) with clairvoyant experts (Figure 1).
 Previous methods have modeled the data with noise z and generators Gi as p(Gi|z) · Gi(z), with p(Gi|z) = p(Gi) = p(Gj) ∀i, j.
 By contrast, our MCTS method is a conversion based approach, where each state is a complete TSP tour, and each action converts the original state to a new state (also a complete TSP tour).
 However, when learning from human interactions in the wild, it is crucial to be able to learn offline and test the policy before deploying it, lest it learn inappropriate behaviors (e.g, Horton (2016)).
 Whenever the high-level layer proposes a sub-goal from the sub-goal space, the lowlevel layer then aims to achieve it without considering the overall goal again.
 The brain processes an extraordinary amount of data, yet from moment to moment, much of that information is filtered out.
 We foresee that our method would allow for intervention on intermediate states of the solution of the ODE, allowing for injection of shape priors or other regularizing constraints.
 These tasks are motivated by prior work in this space, but unfortunately, the associated datasets come from different languages and varied sources.
 In Section 4, we demonstrate the potential of our GNN-based heuristics for selecting candidates and counter-examples in the CEGAR-based solver framework.
 LILAC is conceived as a method to learn strong embeddings by using the recursive training strategy of incremental learning alongside the use of unlabelled/wrongly-labelled data as hard negative examples.
 To learn the real transition T , we then sample fake transitions from our synthesized model T ′ with the same policy.
 More importantly, because the localRNN is only applied to local windows, the aforementioned two drawbacks of RNNs can be naturally mitigated.
 Our PIE methodology identifies a tractable subset of images which are more challenging for sparse and non-sparse models.
 Benefit from the small action space feature, we can apply a simpler model to fit the policy, which work more efficiently.
 In each pathway, taking the initial feature representation as the input, we employ the attractor networks to iteratively learn the intrinsic feature representation.
In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called sensible adversary, in order to overcome the trade-off between natural accuracy and robustness.
 The challenge is that we would not be able to elicit a belief from a classifier on “how many other classifiers would agree with themselves”, which renders the task of computing the prior difficult.
 Choromanski et al., (2019a) propose updating Σ in the sense to tracking the low-dimensional manifold of the gradient space.
 Our contributions are as follows:
Wastage of Information: For existing learned Bloom filters to have a lower FPR, the classifier score greater than the threshold τ should have a small probability of wrong answer.
 We design a custom score function to ensure the differentially private selection of “best” winners, which aids DPLTM to significantly improve the privacy-utility trade-off for differentially private neural networks.
 At a high level, the significance of our work is also on discovering that the attention information from auxiliary network affects the result of image-to-image translation, which we think would be influential to other related research in the future.
 This allows us to estimate the amount of context used by a language model as a function of the distance of past tokens from the current prediction time step.
 Since the base model tends to be heavy, the filter can save much computation consumption.
 We argue that because of this characteristic, a significantly reduced number of perturbations is sufficient.
The main contributions of this work are three-fold.
 This is a form of “posterior collapse”, similar to VAEs, where powerful decoders can cause the latent variables to be ignored, as explained in Alemi et al., (2018).
 These hyper-parameters influence the number of parameters in the model, and thus the compression rate.
 In the training process, we traverse the tree from leaf to root; and when training on a certain subgraph, we minimize the usual GCN loss, plus an additional term called consistency loss.
 We note that there exist several studies (Zaheer et al., 2018; Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019; Luo et al., 2019) that also attempted to address the same research question.
 First we establish the forward/backward stability at the initialization and derive the gradient upper/lower bounds by utilizing the statistical concentration of random matrix.
 The network architectures used by Siamese trackers emphasize tracking by detection via correlation of the target and search images in a learned feature space (Bertinetto et al., 2016; Held et al., 2016).
 Thus, it is sequential.
 We show that, with an easy setting of the involved hyperparameters in the controller, it can directly enforce the relevance scores towards right-skewed distributions (Clauset et al., 2009).
 Our memory layers incorporate convolutional and LSTM components.
Memory Issue.

While these examples are designed to be illustrative, they are similar to problems faced in actual research.
 Input features consist of frequency-limited true features and noise.
 To our knowledge, there are no existing metrics for conditional generation that capture all of these key properties.
 Chin et al., (2019) points out that lower image resolution may produce better detection accuracy by reducing focus on redundant details.
 Separate from our work, these insights can help lay a foundation for how to explain the choice of PBL models in future work.
 However, as a human is always required to be in the loop, our second framework allows humans to provide their feedback implicitly before the agent starts training.
 This is consistent with past work that demonstrates gains from GAN-augmented supervised learning in specific data-starved situations but reports degraded accuracy when all training data is used (Bowles et al., 2018, Tab.4).
 From the equivalence of a discriminative model based on Gaussian distribution to a fully connected layer, we demonstrate that the SDGM can be used as a module of a deep NN.
 The CGAT learns clustering assignments for each region according to their temporal patterns so that regions with different temporal patterns are assigned with different spatial feature extractors.
EBMs with such logical composition operators enable several capabilities.
 Our method is an autoencoder architecture that we henceforth refer to as the Outlier Preserving Distribution Mapping Autoencoder (OP-DMA).
 The proposed method not only produces more appropriate explanations (Kim et al., 2018b) but can also be used as a post-processing of the VQA model to boost the performance.
 In this paper, we propose a novel effective solution to DML and bring new insights from the perspective of learning theory that can guide the discovery of new methods.
The symmetry groups in neural network weight space have long been formally studied (Chen et al., 1993).
 Secondly, we show a one-to-one correspondence between a function by invariant deep neural networks and a function on the fundamental domain (Proposition 2).
 The algorithm results in samples from a highly complex distribution, starting from a simple mean-field approximation.
 Figure 1 illustrates a comparison of responses for standard convolution + ReLU and EVPConv in ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet, and shows that the proposed EVPConv produces less noises and more responses around object boundary than standard convolution + ReLU, which demonstrates the capability of EVPConv to separate robust features from non-robust ones.
 Moreover, our algorithm can reduce the computation cost by 10x compared to the naive approach.
 We examine behaviors of memorization effect from multiple perspectives.

 Our contributions are summarized as follows:
 Using VIC, we identify decision states by attempting to hit the relevant information required at a particular state by minimizing the mutual information I(Ω, At|St) (for every state St, action At).
Moreover, with toy experiments (refer to section D in appendix) on low-dimensional synthetic data, we analyze if GAN can indeed produce samples that can follow the low-density boundaries of indistribution.
 For example, for Ant and Humanoid, it improves over SAC by 21% and 24%, respectively, with one million samples.

 (2) Solid Initial Model – some clients have limited or even no data for personalization.
 Theorem 1 (Informal).
 In contrast, as optimization variables we use the samples Y instead of the probability density pg.
 For those language GANs, there are several critical issues such as whether the D detects the discrepancy or not; the detected discrepancy is severe or not, the signals from D could improve the generator or not are still unclear.
 During training, the visual feature and semantic embedding space are aligned with the seen predicates as anchors, i.g,, a visual feature and semantic embedding labeled with the same predicate fall onto the same point/area in the common space.
 Given that this precision is measured based on classifier predictions, we term it as soft precision.
 The choice of thresholds relies only on training set, and takes no additional computations.
 Next, it has wide applications including classification theory (Feo et al., 1994), computer vision (Sander et al., 2008) and communication algorithms (Jiang & Walrand, 2010).
 We test this method on a variety of simulated vision-based robot tasks without any task-specific reward function.
 By showing that RST is an instantiation of X-regularization, we motivate RST as an appropriate data dependent regularizer that improves both standard accuracy and robustness.
 These enable to effectively compress the error and complexity of the models as little as possible.
 We propose to use Centroid Networks to benchmark how hard this dataset is.
Since we focus on meta goal-generation and leave the low level policy for independent learning, we believe our algorithm can still accelerate the acquisition of new tasks sampled from much wider task distributions.
 Different from obtaining a set of policies that approximate the Pareto front in MORL (Liu et al., 2017), we are merely interested in a Pareto optimal policy which fully reflects our preference information.
 We consider a variety of machine learning algorithms and average the performance to obtain a comprehensive metric.
 SLW allows the networks to improve their accuracy.
 We find that 60K training samples are sufficient to reduce the attack accuracy of a causal model to a random guess.

 These plateaus are well-known features of this setup (Saad & Solla, 1995; Engel & Van den Broeck, 2001), but are not observed when training on the MNIST task nor on other datasets used commonly in machine learning.
 Zhang et al., (2019) suggested that a noisy quadratic model is sufficient to describe the performance of neural networks on both the training set and the test set.
 We reserve the notations {Ci}i=0,1,... to represent universal positive constants that are independent of problem parameters.
 3Finally, we investigate contests where the performance of a participant’s entry is determined by their exerted effort perturbed by random noise.
 To accommodate for this we introduce a weighted loss function over the samples.
 Such labels can be very hard to learn due to data paucity.
 A forecasting system should adapt its predictions to take into consideration this event.
Therefore, it is very reasonable to ask ourselves the following question: If generative models can work on such high dimensional data, is it necessarily the case that they would be ill-suited from a representation learning perspective? If no, how do we leverage these successes for representation learning? Further, how do we take inspiration from the big representation learning successes in natural language processing (Devlin et al., 2018) and the generative modeling successes for images and audio and design a representation learning approach for images?As far as representation learning on images goes, the state-of-the-art systems at the moment are contrastive methods.
 (3) The development of deep learning programming packages, such as PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017) and TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2016), greatly eases the assembly of multiple network components (corresponding to different modalities) together for multimodal representation learning (Li et al., 2018b).
 Driven by this observation, this paper proposes a novel deep RNN architecture by unfolding a reweighted-`1-`1 minimization algorithm.
Our contributions include:
 For example, in machine translation, the attribution could be sentence length (Luong et al., 2015), word itself (n-gram) in the reference file (Kumar & Tsvetkov, 2018); In question answering, the attribution could be answer length/type/position (Seo et al., 2016), document length (Joshi et al., 2017), and query length/type (Chen et al., 2016b).
 Their results depend on expert guidance, and it is possible that the best solution is left out.
 Despite the results, architectures have become more complex, which is not desirable in real-world scenarios because the quality of algorithms or architectures is also measured by the training time and computational complexity of learning trainable parameters (Goodfellow et al., (2016)).
 Inversely, there is also a ground-truth classification function c : Rn → 2S that identifies the label set from the rendered example, i.g,, c(x) = T .
 Such combination-based classification has been proposed as a “gating” approach (Atzmon & Chechik, 2019).
 Motivated by these results, our intent is to construct a simple architecture for matrix completion that follows from geometric considerations rather than ad-hoc ones.
 Consequently, hybridization of SGD and STDP enables robust image classification under noisy input while preserving the accuracy of the baseline DNN for clean images.
 These local filtersor wavelets are assumed to form a normalized tight frame, i.g,, the image can be reconstructed from the vectors using the linear filters as the basis functions.
 Further, our empirical findings on when and how auxiliary tasks help can inform future work in developing self-supervision techniques.
 BERT is currently one of the state-of-the art algorithms for sentence embedding.
 To model supply chains, we might consider purchases of goods and services around the world.
 By changing the number of quantization levels, QSGD allows the user to trade-off communication bandwidth and convergence time.
We also propose a method to generate template representations of classes such that individual input samples can be interpreted in reference to the template representations.
 Nonetheless, we believe that even when complete full memorization is not necessary, the autoencoder initialization can help to speed up training convergence by allowing the model to remember long sequences, which can then be gradually forgotten during training if deemed uninformative.
In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach, called OTCOARSENING, that produces a hierarchical abstraction of a graph independent of downstream tasks.

 The main contribution of this work is showing how recent progress in AI can be brought together to improve planning, value function learning, and exploration, in a way that together they form robust algorithms for solving challenging reinforcement learning environments.
We highlight that while we focus on languages as a specific instantiation of a channel, our framework can generalize to any arbitrary specification, such as other types of languages or other modalities.
Summarily, FMs and GCNs are two general classes of techniques that are typically used for different applications.
 fig.2 validates that flow loss gradually declines to low values after millions of iterations, indicating the qualification of flow loss to serve as an intrinsic reward signal.
 The contribution of each visual-semantic node to a frame node is dynamically weighted based on their similarity.
 We address this shortcoming by augmenting the QM9 dataset with out-of-equilibrium configurations for 10K of its molecules at a 90%, 150% range of interatomic distances.
 Each demonstration spans a time horizon T and contains information about the robot states and actions, e.g, demonstrated sensor values and control inputs at each time step.
 And empirically, the adjacency matrix of the FC layer after training with CSS signals reveals local dependence of elements for CSS signals.
 The proposed approach can cope with both transductive training and inductive training.
 Note that the domain alignment term is the same as the negative information gain of the binary domain labels (source/target).
 Finally, to certify the property we check if each concrete output in the abstraction a classifies to the correct label (this is typically easy).
 DBNN uses the online codevector histogram to approximate probabilities.
 Numerically, we confirm the existence of first-order permutation saddles.
 It is worth noting that the collaboration network is only used during the training process, the student network with the original structure is used for prediction during the inference time.
 Here, the word apple refers to a company, and hence the word vector of apple (about fruit) is an irrelevant source of prior knowledge for both v and the topic Z4.
 Additionally, all regularization methods tend to be more effective on more difficult tasks.
 We present competitive semantic (and panoptic) segmentation results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 (Everingham et al., 2015) and Cityscapes dataset.
 However, puzzles with polynomial-time definitions constitute the complexity class NP , which contains P problems such as shortest-path as well as hard problems such as factoring and finding a neural network with a sufficiently low training loss.
 In this way the aforementioned pitfall in prior weight pruning technique on BERT can be avoided.
 Second, our method is unsupervised, not using any 3D structure annotation such as voxels, cloud points, or meshes as well as bounding boxes or segmentation annotation.
 In this case, the naive distributed synchronous SGD (SSGD) can only achieve a poor scalability of 0.8.
 Even with the rules completely specified, the behavior of the players will crucially depend on the heuristics that they use to anticipate each other’s behavior and choose their own strategy, possibly in the face of uncertainty.
 Our contributions are summarized as follows.
In this paper, we make the following contributions.
Furthermore, we can derive a new explanation framework by formulating the model explanation to a two-player min-max game between explanator and adversarial attacker.
From a theoretical point of view, image realism means that the images lie inside the support of the probability distribution of natural images (see Ledig et al., (2017), where image realism was used for super-resolution).
 The proposed methodology can retain the learned knowledge over phase 1 with minimal forgetting while using this learned knowledge to rapidly learn (forward transfer) new knowledge over phase 2.
There is a different way of looking at, and motivating, our results, namely from the point of view of the study of the brain in connection to evolution.
 More specifically, we theoretically prove that over-parameterized neural networks’ training process can be controlled by the eigenvalues of the integrating operator defined by the NTK.
This framework enables us to cleanly reason about our extension of the rugosity measure to piecewise affine functions using finite differences, enabling us to make the connection between data augmentation the measure of rugosity via the A matrices.
Our contributions summarize as follows:
 In this work, we introduce a model-based DRL framework where we learn a latent dynamics model exclusively from the multi-step reward prediction criterion and then use MPC to plan directly in the latent state-space.
 To best of our knowledge, we are the first to identify and propose self-ensemble as a principled technique against learning under noisy labels.
 We use not only discrete evaluation metrics like BLEU, but also semantic metrics like word mover’s distance (Kusner et al., 2015) to encourage both syntactically and semantically valid text generation.
 The outcome of the empirical analysis joins the theoretical results, showing significant performance improvements compared to the singletask version of the algorithms in various RL problems, including several MuJoCo (Todorov et al., 2012) domains.
 There are mainly two forms in existing deep graph matching works: i) displacement loss (Zanfir & Sminchisescu, 2018) similar to the use in optical flow estimation (Ren et al., 2017); ii) the so-called permutation loss (Wang et al., 2019) involving iterative Sinkhorn procedure followed by a cross-entropy loss.
 The structure relations are well defined by jointly considering node attributes, between-node paths, and graph topological structures.
 The proposed Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles architecture is described in Section 3 and experimentally evaluated in Section 4.
 A further boost is obtained by incorporating incremental learning of the discovered classes in the classification task, which allows information to flow between the labelled and unlabelled images.
The set X models such explicit constraints, but it poses an additional challenge for stochastic gradient algorithms as the new weight obtained from the SGD method (with or without momentum) must be projected back to the set X to maintain its feasibility.
 There are several definitions of discrete curvature for graphs.
 While the aforementioned methods optimize DPP with specific approximation, a series of efforts also seek to optimize the DPP term directly (Gillenwater et al., 2014; Mariet & Sra, 2015; Bardenet & Titsias, 2015).
 For most of the convolutional neural networks, BN layers are often after the Conv or FC layers.
 Intuitively, for a ucc classifier to count the number of unique classes in a bag, it has to first learn discriminant features for underlying classes.
 With the additional mechanism to retroactively update task-adaptive parameters, it can further alleviate the order-sensitivity from unidirectional knowledge transfer as well.
 Learning from the current solution is made easier by focusing RL on the improvement operators only.
 Experimental results show that the SVQN can utilize past information to help in decision making for efficient inference, and outperforms other baselines on several challenging tasks.
 On CIFAR10, the improvements are 6.4% and 3.6% respectively.
 Experiments show that Lazy-CFR and Lazy-CFR+ works well in practice as suggested by the theory.
 Experimental results supported our assumption, i.g,the disentangled consistent feature components are usually more reliable for the task.
 While this may appear to be a weakness, since less information is being used, we find in practice that it seems to lead to more stable training profiles.
 However, we can avoid this situation by learning input-dependent pruning to run computation on dynamical graphs, as an input query often triggers a small fraction of the entire graph so that it is wasteful to perform computation over the full graph for each input.
 This makes it less effective to perform adaptive attacks against MI (Athalye et al., 2018).
These two assumptions together are called strong ignorability (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983).
More specifically, our proposed AE-OT model separates the manifold embedding step and the probability distribution transformation step, the former is carried out by an autoencoder (AE), the latter is accomplished by a convex optimization framework (OT).
Our use of tensor products of value vectors is inspired by the semantics of linear logic in vector spaces (Girard, 1987; Melliès, 2009; Clift & Murfet, 2017; Wallbridge, 2018) in which an algorithm with multiple inputs computes on the tensor product of those inputs, but this is an old idea in natural language processing, used in models including the second-order RNN (Giles et al., 1989; Pollack, 1991; Goudreau et al., 1994; Giles et al., 1991), multiplicative RNN (Sutskever et al., 2011; Irsoy & Cardie, 2015), Neural Tensor Network (Socher et al., 2013) and the factored 3-way Restricted Boltzmann Machine (Ranzato et al., 2010), see Appendix A.
 We first train an 8-layer ∗In this paper, both “correctly classified” and “misclassified” refer to predictions on natural training examples.
 Note that SGD+Nesterov (as well as Stochastic Heavy Ball) does not converge faster than SGD, in line with our theoretical analysis.
Overall, while our results do not improve self-supervision per-se, they help to characterize the limitations of current methods and to better focus on the important open challenges.
In the following sections, we introduce in more detail the concept of a fold-set, and describe its geometric structure for a subclass of ReLU networks.
 When our model is adapted to new domains, we progressively increase the slots in the memory bank.
 We argue that optimization in the policy network’s parameter space will be more efficient.
 However, we can obtain a noisy estimate of this indicator by utilizing the few provided training examples for the target class, and then further refine this approximation within the meta-learning framework.
 Let vt be the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of ∇2f(wt).
 We find this protects against that particular adversary, but that repeating the attack method finds a new adversary the fine-tuned victim is vulnerable to.
 Even without any training on the feature extraction step, the performance is comparable to state-of-the-art deep supervised learning approaches, particularly when training data are scarce; and iii) By analyzing the pruning patterns of the pGST, we deduce that graph signals in different domains call for different network architectures; see fig. 1.
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
 The main theoretical contributions in this paper are to solve this issue.
 By applying a standard black-box attack method such as NES on the embedding space, adversarial perturbations can be found efficiently for a target model.
 Model-free algorithms are more flexible and require less space, which have achieved remarkable performance on benchmarks such as Atari games and simulated robot control problems.
 Hence the implementation of the pruned network requires no additional effort.
 It applies to any one-hidden-layer neural network with two-piece linear activations for regression under convex loss.
Our Key Contributions.
 Intuitively, the estimation of performing actions with different types should be evaluated separately by explicitly considering different information.
 We evaluate our method on CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009) and ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) datasets.
 OPIQ does not rely on an optimistic initialisation to ensure efficient exploration, but instead augments the Q-value estimates with count-based bonuses in the following manner:Q+(s, a) := Q(s, a) + C(N(s, a) + 1)M , (1)where N(s, a) is the number of times a state-action pair has been visited and M,C > 0 are hyperparameters.
 The pre-training loss on the visual-linguistic corpus is incurred via predicting randomly masked words or RoIs.
 Concretely, we evaluate our operator with standard base models on image classification and object detection.
Our contribution:
 Finally, an interventional approach to disentanglement has also be taken by Suter et al., (2018), who focuses on extrinsic disentanglement in a classical graphical model setting and develop measures of interventional robustness based on labeled data.
 Our source code and benchmarks are publicly available on Github1.
 RPM, together with the two-way autoencoder, provides a conditionally reversible architecture (CrevNet) for spatiotemporal learning.
 The performance is further improved, when classes aredivided into disjoint chains in a supervised manner using gender and ethnic group information or even in an unsupervised manner.
 Using this novel unsupervised training procedure we learn encoders with adjustable robustness properties and show that these are effective at learning representations that perform well across a variety of downstream tasks.
 Our CR-NAS offers improvements for both fast mobile model and accurate model, such as ResNet (He et al., 2016), MobileNetV2 (Sandler et al., 2018), ResNeXt (Xie et al., 2017).
 We publicly release code and dataset splits to reproduce our results, in order to allow other researchers to carry out rigorous evaluations with minimum additional effort1.
 We present two examples for each covering bound.
 For a positive definite matrix H ∈ Rd×d, the weighted `2-norm is defined by ‖x‖2H = x>Hx.
 For example, in the 20-shot setting on the TRIANGLES dataset, our method shows a substantial improvement of nearly 7% and 20% over DL-based and unsupervised baselines, respectively.
 As can be seen, {st}T−1t=0 essentially forms a Markov chain with the transition kernel induced by π∗ as Pπ ∗ (s, s′) = ∑ a∈A π∗(a | s)·P (s′ | s, a).
 The left side of Figure 1 presents a natural input and a typical activation vector.
 Compared to previous work, this renders GENESIS significantly more suitable for a wide range of applications in robotics and reinforcement learning.
However, filters of a convolutional layer are usually high-dimensional while being together written as one vector, which makes the modeling and sampling of a filter space highly costly in practice in terms of training time, sampling time, and filter generator memory footprint.
To the best of our knowledge, all current approaches for active learning in semantic segmentation rely on hand-crafted active learning heuristics.
 Ilyas et al., (2019) extend this line of work by proposing the idea of gradient priors and bandits: BanditsTD.
We conduct several diagnostic experiments that analyze learning rate decays under the budgeted setting.
 We provide a more thorough comparison to prior work in Section 3.1.
 The scoring function isf(q,d) = 〈φ(q), ψ(d)〉.
 We show that our sampling-free probabilistic propagation achieves similar accuracy and log-likelihood — justifying the use of mean-field approximation in BQNs.
 While we only examined our method with PPO, other on-policy RL algorithms can easily be used and we believe the method is general enough to be adapted to off -policy RL algorithms.
Contributions.
Generally, architecture structure cannot be trained independently regardless of network weights (Liu et al., 2018b; Pham et al., 2018).
1It is important to emphasize that the notion of similarity used above (i.g,, which examples are considered similar) is not a constant but changes in the course of training as network parameters change.
 Sometimes the input is padded with a fixed number of extra values to provide greater computation (Graves et al., 2016), in other cases, input values are systematically dropped to reduce the amount of computation (e.g, frame dropping in reinforcement learning (Mnih et al., 2016)).
In addition to being non-autoregressive, our models explicitly consider dependencies at both slot level and token level.
 Now for a fixed input xm, as to which equilibrium is reached depends on hm−1, but are nevertheless finitely many.
 MABN can completely get over small batch issues without introducing any nonlinear manipulation in inference procedure.
 The contributions are summarized below:
 Specifically, we derive a generic condition on the input and output linear transformations, under which both GD and SGD with zero initialization on all hidden weights can find global minima.
 The highly multivariate data that are widely available in social networks and recommender systems can be ideal applications for our approach.
 All the derivations have been deferred to Appendices B, C and D.
 Figure 1 illustrates how posterior distributions evolve for certain and uncertain weight distributions while learning two consecutive tasks.
 Therefore, the model is tolerant of a small number of outliers.
 Consequently, we prove that algorithms that bypass the error backpropagation steps, such as Direct Feedback Alignment, can compute the sign of the true gradient with respect to the weights of our constraint networks without the need for backpropagation.
 PA-DGN is applicable to various tasks and we provide two representative tasks; the approximation of directional derivatives and the prediction of graph signals.
This paper makes two primary contributions:
 Now, the GAN algorithm can be regarded as simply gradient descent on the Rp → R function θ 7→ J(µθ), which may be analyzed using Proposition 1.
 We then move to describing the problem setting that we have used in the course of the paper and our off-policy estimation approach.
 This leads to tractable linear dynamics under `2 loss, and the final solution can be characterized by kernel regression using a particular kernel named neural tangent kernel (NTK).
 So, more flexibly and generally, one may choose to compute any k, for 1 ≤ k ≤ n, leading orthonormal bases of Do by solving the program:max W1 4 ‖W ∗Y ‖44 subject to W ∈ St(n, k;R) ⊂ R n×k, (6)where St(n, k;R) is the Stiefel manifold.
 Moreover, we do not assume appliance locations are known a priori.
 These results lead to sample complexity bounds for learning certain simple functions that matches the NTK without distributional assumptions and are advantageous when mild isotropic assumptions on the feature are present.
 This is especially useful for domains, such as the Android layout synthesis, for which the output correctness depends mostly on properties of the output and not on the program used to generate it.
 It explains why some tasks are not achieving satisfactory results after fine-tuning because of inappropriate hyperparameter selection.
 Attribute models may be easier to train or untrained (in the case of BoW models), and multiple controllers may be combined flexibly during inference.
Our contributions are as follows.
 Our contributions are:
 We compare our method to existing regularizers such as manifold mixup (Verma et al., 2019), information bottleneck, and information dropout (Achille & Soatto, 2018), which our method significantly outperforms.
 As will be discussed in Section 2, many of these methods cannot capture nonlinear dependence between random variables and/or lead to computationally expensive algorithms.
 OT-SI is an end-to-end framework that learns the transport cost.
 Our contributions are as follows:
 For any such model, we considered 40 complexity measures.
 In this way, we avoid cross-position dependency in the backward process which is relatively slower but produces tighter bounds.
 Then,P (X) = ∑ |α|≤n bαq T α , (1)where bα = (xα1 , . ,x α n) T , qα = (qα,1, . , qα,l)T , where qα,j = qα,j(s1, . , st), t = ( n+k k ) , arepolynomials; sj(X) = ∑n i=1 x αj i are the power-sum multi-symmetric polynomials.
 If sticking to standard mini-batch SGD and maintaining the level of parallelisation, the batch size B would have to be reduced below the device (locally optimal) capacity in order to alleviate this generalization issue, which however impacts training time1.
 We do the theoretical analysis in section 2.
 Interestingly and promisingly, we find that the performance of JKNet can be promoted further if it is utilized along with our DropEdge.
 The distributions are predicted at each node, resulting in a high-dimensional prediction problem.
 We work with the Habitat simulator from Savva et al., (2019).
In summary, the key contributions of this work are
Overall, we provide an extensive set of experiments on three source-target language pairs, English– Spanish, English–Russian, and English–Hindi, selected for variance of script and typological features.
 These contributions are in contrast to (Amos et al., 2018) which did not consider state constraints, and implemented a differential dynamic programming (Tassa et al., 2014) method to solve the MPC optimization for which convergence could not be guaranteed.
 We address this problem in multiple ways.
 Although this mechanism is not obvious from the algorithm construction, our behavioral analysis confirms the presence of this guided exploration effect.
 The labeled set for generating the model for an unseen task is now optional, which is only used to compute the initialization of model weights in our case.
 ii) We introduce asymmetric regularization on the content latent codes to achieve class-invariant representations.
 We evaluate our approach on various environments ranging from simple grid-world (Sohn et al., 2018) to StarCraft II (Vinyals et al., 2017).
Our contributions are summarized as follows.
 In addition, we present an algorithm for iteratively finding the IB phase transition points (Section 5).
 We observe that for many pruned atomic blocks, their weights diminish at the early stage of learning and never “revive” throughout the rest of learning.
 An alternative low-variance choice of MI estimator is Information Noise-Contrastive Estimation (InfoNCE, Oord et al., (2018)), which introduces the Noise-Contrastive Estimation with flexible critics parameterized by neural networks as a bound to approximate MI.
 It indicates that AutoML is not a panacea: careful analysis and design insights (i.g,, removing bottleneck, specialized heads) can effectively prune the search space and improve the sample efficiency.
 Nevertheless, it is often easy to evaluate, and is a powerful tool for studying the representational power of bounded norm ReLU networks.
 Note that we choose not to involve state-action pairs as in GAIL(Ho & Ermon, 2016), or state-state pairs as in an observation-based GAIL (Torabi et al., 2018a), because our state-only formulation imposes weaker constraints than the two above options, thus providing more flexibility to handle different agent dynamics; 4) Regularized Policy Update.
 We also tested our proposed attacks on several state of the art defenses.
In summary, our contributions are summarized as follows:
 SCALOR can also be regarded as a generative tracking model since it not only detects object trajectories but is also able to predict trajectories into the future.
 Our approach significantly reduces the attacker’s performance (e.g, 30-53% reduction on MNIST and 13- 28% on CUB200) at a marginal cost (1-2%) to defender’s test accuracy.
 We refer to one such feature mapping as co-attentive equivariant.
 Compared to (Wang et al., 2018; Elthakeb et al., 2018), our method has the advantage that training quantized DNNs has nearly the same computational complexity as standard float32 training.
 To allow for efficient training, such adversarial samples need to be generated at a rate sublinear (e.g, logarithmic) in C.
 Two examples of prior-predictor pairs are shown in the top two plots of Figure 1.
 In contrast to existing results such as spectral norm-based bounds, our bound has no explicit dependence on the size of networks.
 This enables us to develop a reconstruction algorithm that generates a set of candidate graphs given the trace and eliminates the incompatible candidates given the parameters (Section 4).
 We then train this initialized network with spike-based backpropagation for few epochs to perform inference at a reduced latency or time steps.
 For the images in the target dataset, AFDS dynamically learns not only the features to transfer, but also the unimportant neurons to skip.
 Intuitively, if the graph on which we define graph NNs is sufficiently dense, graph-convolution operations mix signals on nodes fast and hence the feature maps lose information for distinguishing nodes quickly.
We also propose a semi-supervised learning model which we name InfoGraph*.
 The core idea is to optimize the feature-wise transformation layers so that the model can work well on the unseen domains after training the model using the seen domains.
 The primary concept of sample-based versus distribution-based regularizations are visualized in Figure 1.
 This result shows that we can preserve the demographic parity gap for free while simultaneously achieving equalized odds.
 Given strong variation of DoS in a warehouse, it is very unlikely that all environment-product combinations would exist in data for the historical average to be valid for future DoS.
 This leaves us with the following natural questions.
 However, we show that by using amortized variational inference (Kingma & Welling, 2013), a principled probabilistic technique, a natural unsupervised objective falls out of our modeling approach that has many connections with past work, yet is different from all past work in specific ways.
 For example, hiders learn to create shelter from the seekers by barricading doors or constructing multi-object forts, and as a counter strategy seekers learn to use ramps to jump into hiders’ shelter.
 The key idea is to use easily accessible node-level information and encourage GNNs to capture domain-specific knowledge about nodes and edges, in addition to graph-level knowledge.
Our focus in this paper is developing algorithms for training models under such coupled ruleexemplar supervision.
 Unfortunately, all of these bounds guarantee the generalization error of only the compressed network, not the original network.
 Using this approach, the main question we try to tackle is:How do learning rate, delay and momentum interact and affect the minima selection process?ContributionsWe start by modelling A-SGD as a dynamical system with delay.
 For instance, due to the localized nature of convolutional filters in classical CNNs, a single convolutional layer is similarly limited in its representational ability.
 Let N be the total number of user devices and K (≤ N ) be the maximal number of devices that participate in every round’s communication.
 Experimental results show that the proposed method makes effectively use of a more detailed prior in the data and improves the performance of typical language generation tasks, including supervised and unsupervised machine translation, text summarization, storytelling, and image captioning.
 However, given the complex nature of the search space, it is unlikely that any hand-designed heuristic is able to fully exploit the structure of the problem and the data distribution encountered in practice.
 Intuitively, as learning a deep RL policy is often noisy with high variance, if the task possesses a low-rank property, this scheme will give a clear guidance on the learning space during training, after which a better policy can be anticipated.
 To be more concrete, in the RNA case, F is difficult to design for the following reasons:(i) RNA secondary structure needs to obey certain hard constraints (see details in Section 3), which means certain kinds of pairings cannot occur at all (Steeg, 1993).
 In both cases we show that Reformer matches the results obtained with full Transformer but runs much faster, especially on the text task, and with orders of magnitude better memory efficiency.
 IMGEPs self-define goals in a goal space that represents important features of the outcomes of actions, such as the position reached by an arm.
We name our method IBA which stands for Information Bottleneck Attribution.
 Thus, despite some manner of hierarchical learning - as seen in their layers capturing simpler to more complex features as a function of depth - CNNs do not form the ideal representational model we seek.
 In this task, DRNets solve a previously unsolved chemical system, which subsequently led to the discovery of a new material that is importantfor solar fuels technology.
 As for tropical adversarial attack, we show that one can construct input adversaries that can change network predictions by perturbing the decision boundaries polytope.
Emphasis spread.
Our specific contributions are the following:
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed detection scheme, we combine the recent progress of feature pyramid networks and our detection head to form the framework of FoveaBox.
 For a complete DAG with n nodes, the number of available paths from input to output is (n − 1)!.
 Our training procedure becomes updating the parameters of two neural networks, which is very similar to generative adversarial network (GAN, Goodfellow et al., (2014a)).
The contributions of this work can be summarized into three folds:
 The agent receives high intrinsic rewards from the discriminator when there is high mutual information.
 In fact, in the majority of the experiments, the improvement is better than training on the same dataset, augmented with 3 to 21 times Gaussian noisy data.
In this paper, we are interested in improving the tightness of output interval bounds (referred to as bounds from now on).
 Similarly, based on their precision metric, Zhou et al., (2015) claim that the object detectors learned in CNNs play an important role in identifying specific objects, whereas Morcos et al., (2018) challenge this conclusion based on their finding that units with high CCMAS measures were not especially important in the performance of their CNNs and concluded: “...
 (Neil & Liu, 2016) proposed a deep CNN to pre-process spiking data from DVS, which is used in various deep network architecture and is also used to achieve an accuracy of 97.40% on N-MNIST datasets, in spite of its complicated pre-processing approach.
 This leads to two convergence regimes in WeightNorm training and explains the utility of WeightNorm from the perspective of the NTK.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
 FALCON can be easily integrated into other architectures, and we propose FALCON-branch which combines FALCON with a branch architecture for a better performance.
 Meanwhile, the IWAE-STL gradient performed consistently well despite lacking a firm theoretical footing.
 According to each type of the channel importance, we further design different DRL agents (i.g,, a runtime agent and a static agent) to learn a sparsity ratio in a layer-wise manner.
 Applying this innovation to an inequality-constraint based transformation ensures the convexity of all subproblems, and hence easily ensures global minima, the inequality-constraint prevents the output of a nonlinear function from changing much and reduces sensitivity to the input.
 We have also evaluated PUGAN in terms of both quantitative computational performance and qualitative metrics including the human perceptual evaluation.
The rest of the paper is divided as follows: in Section 2, we discuss related work on SISR and MFSR; Section 3 outlines HighRes-net and section 4 presents ShiftNet, a differentiable registration component that drives our registered loss mechanism during end-to-end training.
 We thus validate the explanation by testing its implication on real-world datasets.
 By dynamically adjusting the strength of the supervision, we can theoretically prove that the proposed self-distillation algorithm can recover the correct labels, and empirically the algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art results on Fashion MNIST and CIFAR10.
 First, the inference at a data point considers a few of its nearest neighbors but not all of them; therefore, it may lose some important correlations.
 To our best knowledge, this is the first work to consider skewness for normalization.
 This is particularly important for training large-scale models on large-scale datasets.
 In contrast, our proposed method, invariance induction by discriminator matching (IIDM), explicitly considers the divergence minimization requirements by minimizing the proxy of the divergence between the marginals, which push the representations with different attributes are recognized similarly by the discriminator (as shown in Figure 1-(b)).
 As a result, we can create arbitrary amounts of training data with gradual changes and a known ground truth order.
 We achieve around 18% relative improvements in terms of bridging the gap between the unsupervised baseline and supervised methods on Flickr30k Entites and around 34% on ActivityNet-Entities.
 Wilson & Finkel (2009) implemented a neural network based Kalman Filter (KF) but did not provide theoretical analysis on the approximation error.
 Firstly, changes in the input images styles would have no influence on the encoder-decoder model, and YOLOv3 has good generalization ability(Redmon et al., 2015; Redmon & Farhadi, 2018), so the two-stage method would have better generalization ability than the end-to-end method(Deng et al., 2016b).
 To allow for instance-aware inference control in the branch level, we integrate L lightweight hypernetworks SelectionNets, one for each cell to determine the importance weight of each branch.
 Specially, on the Split CUB dataset, MEGA achieves an average accuracy of 80.58±1.94%, which surpasses the multi-task baseline which is previously believed as an upper bound performance of lifelong learning algorithms (Chaudhry et al., 2018b).
 On Split CIFAR, while FGSM and PGD cannot hurt the performance of A-GEM, the proposed GREV degrades the accuracy of A-GEM by as much as 20%.
 Thus, in this work we apply MaskConvNet to one of most popular structured pruning methods, filter-wise pruning.
 Finally, the combined short-term and long-term representations are fed into the final prediction layer to complete the architecture.
 We later show that the cross-entropy loss used to train InfoCNF corresponds to the mutual information between the generated image and codes in InfoGAN, which encourages the model to learn disentangled representations.
 First, the discriminator is more sensitive than the generator to the number of quantized bits.
 The highlights and main contributions of this article are summarized as follows:
Traditionally interpretability came at a cost of reduced accuracy.
 Some related works (Amplayo et al., (2018); Xue & Li (2018)) have been done in order to solve this problem, but most of works used multi-input models in some special subdomains such as user sentiment analysis.
 In Section 2, some related work are reviewed.
 Their algorithm was demonstrated on the American option freeboundary equation.
 Compare to Schönherr et al., (2018) which requires the domain-specific knowledge of psychoacoustic hiding, our approach is also more generic and easier to implement in practice.
 We first look at how local perturbations in the current learning rate impact the training loss.
 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first constant time approximation algorithm for GNNs with a theoretical guarantee in terms of approximation error.
 Compare to TS-GLM, TS-PP avoids deriving complex and slow posterior sampling in GLM, while still effectively leveraging the m-way dimension interactions and achieving even better performance by reducing arm space with efficient search strategies.
This heuristic of scaling the head size inversely with the number of heads was proposed initially in Vaswani et al., (2017) and has become the standard way of using multi-head attention (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018).
 This recovers the clear interpolation between training-time teacher-forcing and test-time decoding described in Bengio et al., (2015).
 New work from generates adjacency matrices which are, by construction, invariant to rotation Hoffmann & Noé (2019).
 Both the two stages are essential to improve the performance and generalization capability of TinyBERT.
 This may be of interest beyond Bayesian neural architecture search.
Our goal is to learn a generative model pθ(x|c, z) that fulfills two criteria:1. ∫ z pθ(x|c, z)p(c)p(z)dz matches the joint distribution ∫ z p(x|c, z)p(c)p(z)dz: If wewere learning models of images, we would like the generated images to look realistic and match the true conditional distribution p(x|c).2. The posterior is factorized p(c, z|x; θ) = p(c|x; θ)p(z|x; θ): We would like the control variate to be disentangled from the noise.
 To guarantee naturalness at long-range scale, we then propose to use goal conditioned bi-directional interpolation for modeling the long-range nature needed in the task.
 Unlike the common feature extraction network (with ResNet-50 as the backbone), in this paper, the backbone of the feature extraction network only has 3 convolution layers, and the image is only downsampled once in the first convolution layer to compress the size of the image.
Moreover, we introduce a unified non-domain-specific evaluation metric for generation tasks of node/edge-labeled graphs.
 Selective prediction is a set of techniques based on abstaining from deciding according to some metric threshold.
 Experiment results show that partial weight sharing makes the rank of child models more stable and becomes closer to ground truth.
 In fact, the proposed MMES can be considered as a new kind of auto-encoder (AE) in which convolution operations have been replaced by Hankelization in pre-processing and post-processing.
 As a result, the structural sparsity parameter Γ may enable us to rapidly find “winning tickets” in early training epochs for the “lottery” of identifying successful subnetworks that bear comparable test accuracy to the dense ones.
 It shows that our GT-Net Alg can achieve comparable or even better performance than the competitors, with much less computational cost, and smaller size of found network.
 We use it in a One-versus-All strategy : each network is trained to make a prediction of a class and the most confident one on a sample is used to identify the class of the sample.
 By constructing a memory module containing industrial positron image features, we can generate image generation in a specific domain, and finally conduct an industrial lossless positron image generation model.
In this paper we propose a new graph flow, called graph residual flow (GRF): a novel combination of a generic GCN and recently proposed residual flows (Behrmann et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019).
 We observe that the dependencies of the metric on validation accuracy seem to be correlated between those during training and those applying quantization after training.
 We evaluate the applicability of this simple alteration on a large number of UCI datasets, and demonstrate the advantage for CR based networks over their standard counterparts.
 Pragmatic (i.g, discourse-based) tasks focus on the actual use of language, so a discourse-centric evaluation could by construction be a better fit to evaluate how NLU models perform in practical use cases, or at least should be used as a complement to semantics-focused evaluations benchmarks.
To be more specific, they reward an item more greatly for winning (or being more preferred) in a disadvantageous comparison where its group is weaker than the counterpart.
 We denote by xS either the sub-vector in CS consisting of the entries indexed by S or the vector in CN that is formed by starting with x and setting the entries indexed by S to zero.
 In other words, the direct alignment method only tries to minimize the distance between the two feature map points (one for each network), hence it ignores the distributional difference between the two feature maps (fig.  1(a)).
 To this end, we propose a prototype-based method to align the conditional feature distributions of the two domains.
 It is worth to note that our framework also generalizes to the setting where there is no access to ground truth samples, where we can only rely on reported samples.
 However, the noise to guarantee privacy naturally affects the optimization procedure, but previous approach does not exploit the interaction between privacy noise and optimization of gradient perturbation.
 We elaborate on this property of the evaluation method described in (Kuleshov et al., 2018) in Section 2 and show empirical evidence in Section 4.
 As our discriminator will be taking as input a set of random dosage-outcome pairs, we need to condition its behaviour to be like that of a function on a set.
 Novel training methods were utilized to reproduce better results.
In fig.  1 (b), we illustrate the discriminative capability of our model on the MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998) testing set.
 The algorithms are computationally and memory efficient, and achieve state-of-the-art results on Cifar-10 and ImageNet when compared with competing methods.
 This highlights that relevant information is lost once the softmax function is applied, and raises questions about its role in the lack of robustness observed in NN.
 It can be regarded as an extension of existing linear bandit algorithms (Li et al., 2010; Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011), from linear reward functions to any bounded reward functions.
 DeepReduce can significantly reduce the amount of testing data for testing a DL model but can still achieve comparable performance as the whole testing data achieves.
 This includes diverse outputs by default, compared to sparse support or mode collapse in cGANs, easier explainability and interpretability of the learned latent representation, as well as simple and intuitive manipulation and interpolation of generated or existing images.
 The two parts are trained separately, and their sampling and coding representations are different thus they can’t be translated or interpreted within both spaces; the latter has used the Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE) Makhzani et al., (2015) for 3D generation, having the distribution of latent space of autoencoder trained on point cloud data close to the prior distribution, such as standard gaussian distribution.
In this paper, we present TED, an unsupervised abstractive summarization model with theme modeling and denoising that uses a transformer-based encoder-decoder structure and the pretraining leverages large scale unlabeled corpora.
 Specifically, our contributions are:
 In these experiments, HAL achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy by 5% and reducing forgetting by 20%.
 This relaxation of reconstruction reduces the trade-off between disentanglement and reconstruction of VAE.
 Thus, to use this method, we must show for each problem that the specific cutting plane selection method results in a feasible algorithm (see Chandrasekaran et al., (2012) for an example).
 Flatness of the loss surface, however, is a local property and we require a more local version of robustness to derive a connection between flatness and robustness.
 Since this is not an issue for most of our analyses, we make use of Independent Q-learning, see Tampuu et al., (2017).
While Meta RL algorithms can explicitly optimize for this objective thanks to the ability to interact with the environment, we must rely on the inherent generalizability of the trained networks.
 In contrast to the traditional supervised learning task, where the goal is to predict a value or class for each sample, in MIL, given a set of samples, the goal is to assign a value to the whole set.
 Intuitively, doing so makes the representation agnostic to non-robust features in the input, thus allowing the model’s predictions to be invariant under a shift of the distribution of such features during test time.
 Our contributions are summarized as follows.
 Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed ER-Classifier outperforms other methods by a large margin.
 See results in Table 1 and Table 2.
We note that other recent works (e.g, Moosavi Dezfooli et al., (2019); Qin et al., (2019)) empirically show that using an estimate of curvature at inputs as a regularizer leads to empirical robustness on par with the adversarial training.
 A naive brute search over different partitioning strategies is prohibitively expensive.
 This learning inefficiency of RL has led to significant work in the field of TL (Taylor & Stone, 2009).
 Unlike other instance-wise feature selection methods like (Chen et al., 2018) or (Yoon et al., 2019), TabNet employs a single deep learning architecture with end-to-end learning, to map the raw data to the final decision with soft feature selection.
In recent years, particle-based methods have also been widely applied to many machine learning problems, such as in Bayesian inference.
 Our results verify Zhang et al., (2017)’s finding of deep learning generalization on synthetic noise.
 We show that both HSimplE and HypE are fully expressive.
 The main contributions of this paper are three folds:
To summarize, our paper makes three main contributions:
The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows:
 While we do benefit from exploring a greater number of branches, especially for higher dimensional action spaces (e.g, Humanoid), we observed diminishing returns after only a small number of branches (e.g, 32) across all of the evaluated environments.
 This may become a limiting factor where domain expertise is required to craft such questions (e.g, for biomedical or clinical corpora).
 Concretely, consider a function f that maps sub-architectures to a measure of performance (validation loss).
 We call this type of threat model attack against interpretability (AAI).
 In the experiment section, we will use empirical results to show that this modification can also be applied to reduce the number of layers in an architecture and thus reduce the complexity of the network.
 Then, the adversarial examples generated by D are utilized to fool the T like substitute attacks.
 Furthermore, the method, applying multi-channel LSTM on hidden states from transformers, also can be used in other Transformer based pretrained models, e.g, XLNet and RoBERTa.
Note that the image pairs with fixed down-scaled kernel have been successfully learnt by SR models, such as SRGAN (Ledig et al., 2017), EDSR (Lim et al., 2017), and RDN (Zhang et al., 2018c).
 Specifically, we merge the Transformer architecture with a discrete mixture over reactions.
 The agent observes the experts’ recommendation, belief over the latent MDPs, and state.
 We instead propose a framework to incorporate a richer p(Gi|z) into the generator.
 The methodology and implementation details of our MCTS are very different from the MCTS method developed in (Shimomura & Takashima, 2016).
To support this work, we developed an interactive online platform that allows humans to chat with deep neural network dialog models running on a GPU; the BRL models trained for this study are available live at https://neural.
 However, although their results are promising for certain tasks, it is worth to mention that there is no guarantee the prior human knowledge is always perfect.
 What becomes filtered is not arbitrary, but is directly influenced by one’s objective.
In summary, our contributions are:
 We want to ensure that there is no overlap between pre-training and finetuning datasets, and that all of the tasks are defined on Python code.
 In Section 5, we discuss the related work and conclude in Section 6.
 It works in two key phases, 1) incremental label introduction and 2) adaptive compensation.
 The synthesized model serves as the generator in the WGAN framework and there is a critic that discriminates the two transition data.
 We evaluate the effectiveness of R-Transformer with a various of sequence learning tasks from different domains and the empirical results demonstrate that R-Transformer achieves much stronger performance than both TCN and standard Transformer as well as other state-of-the-art sequence models.
 Our work suggest that PIE could be useful for tasks where it is important to choose not to classify certain examples when the model is uncertain (Bartlett & Wegkamp, 2008; Cortes et al., 2016b;a; Cortes et al., 2017), to aid interpretability as a case based reasoning tool to explain model behavior (Kim et al., 2016; Gurumoorthy et al., 2017; Caruana, 2000; Hooker et al., 2018) or to surface atypical examples for further human inspection (Leibig et al., 2017).
 In addition, it would not sacrifice performance with the small action space.
 We design several loss functions to optimize the model.
 In particular, we restrict adversarial perturbations not to cross the Bayes decision boundary besides the -ball constraint, so that the perturbation ball is adaptively modified for every single data point.
 We proposed two machine learning aided algorithms to mimic the procedure of reporting the peer prediction information, which we jointly name as Machine Truth Serum (MTS).
 Ye et al., (2019) propose letting Σ be the inverse of a diagonal matrix in a way that the update rule of each diagonal element is in the fashion of updating the second moment quantity in “Adam” optimization algorithm of Kingma & Ba (2015).
 Also, a significant fraction of the keys should fall in this high threshold regime to ensure that the backup filter is small.
We perform empirical studies to accompany our theoretical results.
 We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed DDL on several classical yet challenging tasks.
 GLAS can process an image much faster than conventional methods.
 Our second contribution is a new form of posterior regularization, which prevents the aforementioned problem and results in a significantly improved segmentation.
 This leads to an additional layer of complexity for optimizing the model for different NLP problems.
 With the consistency loss, messages in the children subgraphs can be passed to their parent, and thus the relationship between subgraphs is leveraged via the hierarchy of the tree.
 In detail, Yogi (Zaheer et al., 2018) studied the effect of adaptive denominator constant and minibatch size in the convergence of adaptive gradient methods.
 Then we show the gradient bounds do not change much after perturbation as long as the perturbation is relatively small.
 However, because the training objective is minimized endto-end, networks need not necessarily optimize the tracking objective by feature matching.
 It combines the merits of both nested and joint optimization approaches above.
 Then, the scores of supporting features becomes more discriminative, which correspond to the small portion of the right tail, and the majority features have low scores and are regarded as unimportant.
 Stacking such layers, we create not only a memory network, but also a generalization of both a CNN and an LSTM.
 To solve the CSC problem, ADMM (Boyd et al., 2011) is commonly employed (Bristow et al., 2013; Wohlberg, 2014; Heide et al., 2015; Wohlberg, 2016; Garcia-Cardona & Wohlberg, 2018a), where the whole training set needs to be loaded in memory.
 Given a new problem, its hyper-parameters are initialized by the most similar problem in meta train set with distance of hand-crafted meta features.
 Moreover, all but the last example would be significantly more difficult using existing tools.
 The true features have sufficient information for the machine learning task.
 Chen et al., (2019b) claims that different scaled images contain different information.
 Based on the human feedback obtained during pre-training, a quality (Q) function is learned over these imperfect demonstrations to provide the supplementary reward to the RL agent.
 See (Ba & Caruana, 2014) for further discussion on the distinctions between TSC and the original supervised learning task.
 We also show that the SDGM can show superior performance than the fully connected layer with a softmax function via an end-to-end learning with an NN on the image recognition task.
 To handle temporal unsmoothness, we propose additivity-preserved multi-view position encoding (MVPE) by characterizing different kinds of temporal relationship including weekly or daily periodicity and temporal closeness (Zhang et al., 2017).
 They allow defining new concepts (factors) implicitly via examples.
 The network is trained to minimize both the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distance between the distribution of the data in the latent space and a multivariate Gaussian distribution, and what we call a prior-weighted L2 distance between the input and the reconstruction of the input.
 Our philosophy is simple: casting the problem of DML into a simple pairwise classification problem and focusing on addressing the most critical issue, i.g,, the sheer imbalance between positive pairs and negative pairs.
 Conv-TT-LSTM outperforms the state-of-the-art PredRNN++ (Wang et al., 2018a) in LPIPS (Zhang et al., 2018) by 0.050 on the Moving-MNIST-2 and 0.071 on the KTH action dataset, with 5.6 times fewer parameters.
 To do this, we fix the sparse weight masks for the remainder of the training.
 While permutation ambiguity in the weights has been acknowledged, ostensibly ambiguity due to scaling in the weights has received more attention in research.
 Thirdly, we develop a scale-sensitive covering number to control a volume of invariant functions with neural networks (Proposition 5).
 While the distribution of the samples is difficult to quantify, we show that it is not limited to factorized, uni-modal forms, and that the procedure is guaranteed to improve the resulting ELBO without posing a significant computational overhead.
 Our major contribution are:
 We find that, while there exist general patterns in how memorization occurs with the training process (see fig. 1(a)-(b)), it is hard to quantize to which extend such effect can happen (see fig. 1(b)-(f)).
Empirical results show the proposed model consistently outperforms the baseline.
 This is similar in spirit to Goyal et al., (2019); Polani et al., (2006), with the key difference that we use latent options Ω instead of external goals.
 Furthermore, we also investigate combining SOP with PER, and show SOP+ERE also out-performs the more complicated SOP+PER scheme.
 But it requires the dimension dx of the data space to be identical to the dimension dz of the latent space, thus posing computational issues due to high complexity of learning deep flows and computing the Jacobian matrices.
 Moreover, ASBCDHT also has the hard thresholding complexity, O(κs̃ log( 1 )).
 (3) Fast Convergence – reach a high quality model in small number of training rounds.
 Suppose that a given data distribution is separable by a neural tangent model with a sufficient margin under L∞-constraint.
 Second, we consider the training dynamics of the game formulation assuming linear discriminators.
 In this paper, we try to solve these problems via investigating GAN in both pre-training and the adversarial learning process.
 During testing, the samples in the test set are mapped into the visual feature space and matched with the nearest neighbor semantic embeddings of predicates (like chew).
 This precision, which is complementary to hard precision and effective, as shown in our experiment, is lacking in current approaches (Wang et al., 2018).
 In these experiments, Skew-Fit reaches substantially better final performance than prior methods, and learns much more quickly.
 We evaluate the effect of RST on standard and robust accuracy with different adversarial training losses and perturbations on CIFAR-10 in Section 6.3.
 In particular, we suggest looking at the gap between the performance of Prototypical Networks and Centroid Networks, which we call the class semantics consistency criterion (CSCC).
 For example, to learn tasks such as riding bicycles and riding a motorcycle, the two primitive action execution mechanism are entirely different but the two learning process still share similar high-level structures.
 In particular, we find CNN-GP with LAP achieves 81% on CIFAR-10 dataset, outperforming the best previous kernel predictor by 3%.
 Therefore, the known method (Brys et al., 2017) is not suitable for solving this task.
 Besides, the model size can be preserved by encoding SLW with one remaining state of 2 bits for TW.
 In contrast, membership attack accuracy for neural network-based associational models increase as test distributions are changed.
 In practice, at least 4 bits should be adopted for representation in most cases to keep original accuracy.
 Our main contribution:
In this work, we verify that small or moderately large batch sizes substantially outperform very large batches on the test set in some cases, even when compared under a constant step budget.
 The specific value of {Ci}i=1,2,... can be different line by line.
 Such uncertainty can be a more realistic model of contests, but the Nash equilibrium behavior is unknown, highlighting the advantage of using our simulation based approach.
 Accurate segmentation labels for training are usually not easy to obtain, however, with our approach we demonstrate that exact labels for the whole training set are not needed for good segmentation learning performance.
 However, in most applications, predicting such rare tail labels accurately is much more rewarding than predicting common and obvious head labels.
 If for some reason, this process was moved to 4PM, the forecasting system is expected to detect this change and adjust the forecast values accordingly.
 Specifically, Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) (van den Oord et al., 2018) which learns to contrastively predict the future given the past by sampling negatives across and between sequences has been shown to be a universally powerful representation learning approach for multiple modalities (audio, images, text, control).
 (4) Once a deep model is learned, the inference or encoding step is very efficient, thanks to the highly parallel computing architectures and techniques.
 Due to the reweighting, our network has higher expressivity than existing RNN models leading to better data representations, especially when depth increases.
 Once we have determined related attributes, we could make similar analyses based on our proposed measures.
 Therefore, we call for a method which does not require expert knowledge.
Motivated by this, we propose computationally less expensive Adaptive GAN (AdaGAN), a new style transfer framework, and a new architectural training procedure that we apply to the GAN-based framework.

 In an unrestricted model, anything in the past could potentially influence anything in the future, making estimation extremely difficult.
Despite their theoretical guarantees based on quantizing after L2 normalization, Alistarh et al., opt to present empirical results using L∞ normalization.
 A template representation is thus a vector containing the average distance estimates between the sample distribution of a particular class and those of the available environments.

 This suggests a universality of the expected growth in length for iid centered distributions determined only by the variance and sparsity (Figure 3).
 The recognition loss is computed using a fixed recognition model that is pretrained on natural images, and can be done in an unsupervised manner, e.g, without semantic labels of the image.
 The method is then applicable to a large variety of video signals.
 The shared component keeps the model computationally and memory efficient while diversity is captured through the heads matching the individual ensemble members.
 In particular:

 Robot states at each time step within a demonstration are denoted by xt.
 Consequently, a two-layer convolutional reweighting block (RW-LISTA-conv) is then proposed to capture such dependencies, namely the connection of neighboring coefficients.
 Thus, the CoBRF can be seen as an example of adversarial learning, as it considers the domain information gain in an adversarial manner compared to the conventional objective function of the random forest.
 If this is true, the output of the network is correct for all inputs that the attacker can create.
 This model is nonparametric and applied to trained BNN without significant modifications.

 We also show that our path connection is resilient to the considered adaptive attacks that are aware of our defense.
 In particular, we formalize on a variant we call task-global DP, showing and arguing that it adds a useful option to commonly studied settings in terms of trading privacy and accuracy.
In the inference stage, retrieving relevant documents then becomes finding the nearest neighbors of a query in the embedding space.
 Furthermore, on most datasets our algorithm can find an adversarial example with smaller distortion compared with previous approaches.

 Analogously, the training of meta-architecture is also associated with meta-weights.
 DFSNet represents the location of filters in each FS as learnable and differentiable parameters, so that the location of filters can be learned and adjusted accordingly.
 In this spirit, this work seeks to shed light on some intriguing aspects of neural networks.
 It starts from a mostly task independent notion due to random initialization and is bootstrapped in the course of training to be task dependent.
 Critically, these values are normally hand tuned by the experimenter; instead, here we are interested in adapting the amount of compute time to the complexity of the task.
 Most of existing DST models assume independence among slots in dialogue states without explicitly considering potential signals across the slots (Wu et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019; Goel et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2019).
 So encoding marginal changes as states leads to “identity” gradient.
 Based on this condition, one can design a variety of input and output transformations for training deep linear ResNets.
 In fact, it can be shown that our model is a generalization of a state-of-the-art VAE-based collaborative filtering model (Liang et al., 2018).
We want to emphasize that, while the theoretical contributions are novel, our most significant contribution is that of the extensive experimental analysis we have performed to analyze the robustness performance of our agent.
 Intuitively, the more uncertain a parameter is, the more learnable it can be and therefore, larger gradient steps can be taken for it to learn the current task.
Although the 0-1 loss has many robust properties, its non-differentiability and zero gradients make it difficult to optimize.
 Section 5 further provides diversity analysis as a tool to understand why BatchEnsemble works well in practice.
 Finally, we show that our algorithm, which we call monotone Direct Feedback Alignment, can deliver its theoretical promises in practice, by surpassing the learning performance of existing feedback alignment algorithms in binary classification task, i.g,, when the error signal is scalar, and provide decent performance even when the error signal is not scalar.
Our contributions are:
 In particular, if this function θ 7→ J(µθ) satisfies the smoothness assumption, then the GAN training should be stable in that it should approach stationarity under the assumption of an optimal discriminator.
 Finally, we present several experimental results to show the effectiveness of our method.
5 The orthogonal group O(n;R) and the unit sphere Sn−1 can be viewed as two special cases of the Stiefel manifold St(n, k;R), with k = n and k = 1, respectively.
 We also cannot use the two modalities to learn a joint representation of the event in a shared space.
 In particular, using randomized networks, the sample complexity bound for learning polynomials (and their linear combination) on (relatively) uniform base distributions is O(d) lower than using NTK.
 As a result, obtaining a suitable training dataset can be easier as we do not require the hard to obtain ground-truth programs, for which currently no large real-world datasets exist (Shin et al., 2019b).
 Specifically, as opposed to the common practice of rarely tuning the momentum value beyond 0.9, we find that zero momentum sometimes work better for fine-tuning on tasks that are similar with the source domain, while nonzero momentum works better for target domains that are different from the source domain.
 In this paper, we demonstrate the PPLM approach using a GPT-2 345M model (Radford et al., 2019) as the general-purpose LM p(x), but the method applies in any representation space from any transformer-based text generator and allows combination with any attribute model p(a|x).
 We further show that meta-dropout can be understood as meta-learning the variational inference framework for the graphical model in Figure 3.
 Motivated by these limitations, we propose to use Rényi correlation to impose several known group fairness measures.
 The intuition is to optimize over a parametrized family of transport costs, to identify the cost under which the annotated subsets are naturally mapped to each other via optimal transport.
 The key findings that arise from our large scale study are summarized below:
 Combined with the forward process, the complexity of the backward process is reduced by O(n) for input length n, while the computed bounds remain comparably tight.
 On the other hand every polynomial map P satisfying Equation 1 is equivariant.
Main Results.
 We show that under certain assumptions on the probability spaces X,Y the kernel has symmetries which allow for multiple possible solutions in Proposition 2.1.
 There is no explicit supervision available, so we use the objective value as a reward signal in a contextual bandit approach with REINFORCE (Williams, 1992).
 While Habitat is already visually realistic (it uses real world scans from Chang et al., (2017) and Xia et al., (2018) as environments), we improve its physical realism by using actuation and odometry sensor noise models, that we collected by conducting physical experiments on a real mobile robot.
 We evaluate the performance of B-BERT on two very different downstream tasks: crosslingual Named Entity Recognition – a sequence prediction task that requires only local context – and cross-lingual Textual Entailment Dagan et al., (2013) that requires more global representation of the text.
The framework is implemented on a set of second order mass-spring-damper systems and a vehicle platooning model, where it is demonstrated that the infinite horizon cost can be learned and the hard constraints can be guaranteed using a short finite prediction horizon.
 In addition, ablation study on the effect of planning length in our proposed technique suggests that our method can still be effective even when the learned dynamics model is not very accurate.
 By including environments of substantially different difficulty and character, we can evaluate candidate programs first on relatively simple and short-horizon domains: if they don\\u2019t perform well in those domains, they are pruned early, which saves a significant amount of computation time.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach we introduce a suite of tasks (which we call the Hard-Eight suite) that exhibit our three targeted properties.
 In summary, our main contributions are the following:
 We show the superiority of this technique over adversarial constraints and the KLdivergence.
 In all cases, our method can accurately infer the latent subtask graph structure, and adapt more efficiently to unseen tasks than the baselines.
 We propose a dynamic network shrinkage technique which removes those atomic blocks on the fly and greatly reduces the run time of AtomNAS.
 Nonetheless, its estimation saturates at log of the batch size and suffers from high bias.
The contribution of this paper has four aspects:
 Furthermore, as detailed in Section 5.5, there is no kernel function for which the associated RKHS norm is the same as (2); i.g,, training bounded norm neural networks is fundamentally different from kernel learning.
 We combine the prior for next state learned from VAE and the Wasserstein distance-based global constraint from IRL in a unified framework, by imposing a Kullback-Leibler divergence based regularizer to the policy update in the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm.
 Rather than just showing the attacks break these defenses (better defenses will come up), we aim to show that cAdv and tAdv are able to produce new types of adversarial examples.
 In our experiments, we demonstrate that SCALOR can model videos with nearly one hundred moving objects along with a dynamic background on synthetic datasets.
 Furthermore, our approach can achieve the same level of mitigation as baseline defenses, but by introducing significantly lesser perturbation.
Identifying the co-occurrence envelope.
The contributions of this paper are:
Faced with a novel input point, we obtain an uncertainty (Figure 1, bottom plot) by measuring the error of the predictor network against this pattern.
 We apply our technique to two exemplar DL systems: the MalConv data pre-processing pipeline and a novel neural architecture produced by ProxylessNAS.
During transfer learning, instead of fine-tuning with L2-SP regularization which explores the proximity of the pre-trained weights, we argue that a better alternative is to mimic the feature maps, i.g,the output response of each convolutional layer in the source model when images from the target dataset are shown, with L2-distances.
Our contributions are as follows:
 We employ a student-teacher framework similar to Mean-Teacher method Tarvainen & Valpola (2017).
 We make the source code and datasets public available to simulate future research in this field.
 Similar to the MAS framework, our proposed method denoted as Sliced Cramér Preservation (SCP) is also able to preserve a task representation in any layer of a neural network, hence, enabling its application to various unsupervised or self-supervised learning settings.
 Furthermore, new SKUs are created relatively frequently, and the predictive algorithm needs to be robust against that as well.
 First, what is the largest fragment of FOC2 classifiers that can be captured by AC-GNNs? Second, is there an extension of AC-GNNs that allows to express all FOC2 classifiers? In this paper we provide answers to these two questions.
 This indicates that the strategies used by the human visual system on difficult segmentation tasks are best matched by a highly-recurrent model with bottom-up, horizontal, and top-down connections.
 Moreover, we observe signs of dynamic and growing complexity resulting from multi-agent competition and standard reinforcement learning algorithms; we find that agents go through as many as six distinct adaptations of strategy and counter-strategy, which are depicted in Figure 1.
 This helps the GNN to learn useful representations at both global and local levels (Figure 1 (a.iii)), and is crucial to be able to generate graph-level representations (which are obtained by pooling node representations) that are robust and transferable to diverse downstream tasks (Figure 1).
 Our main challenge is that the labels induced by the rules are more noisy than instance-level supervised labels because humans tend to over generalize (Tessler & Goodman, 2019) as we saw in the illustrations above.
 Hence, it does not give precise explanations about why large network can avoid overfitting.
 By analyzing the stability properties of that system, we find:
 We extract 22 meaningful variables from EMNIST, encoding both global and local features.
 CNNs typically use multiple layers connected in a hierarchical manner to learn complex and global representations.
 Let T be the total number of every device’s SGDs, E be the number of local iterations performed in a device between two communications, and thus TE is the number of communications.
 As mentioned earlier, for large size NN verification problems, a slight reduction in the quality of the branching strategy could lead to substantial increase in the total number of branches required to solve the problem.
 We confirm that SV-RL indeed can improve the performance of various value-based methods on “low-rank” Atari games: SV-RL consistently achieves higher scores on those games.

 (3.2) On Multi-MNIST-Sudoku instances, without direct supervision, DRNets perfectly recovered the digits in the mixed Sudokus with 100% digit accuracy, outperforming the supervised state-of-the-art MNIST de-mixing models, including CapsuleNet (Sabour et al., 2017) and ResNet (He et al., 2016).
 However, there are two potential situations that could be encountered in the estimation process that can impede convergence.
 We conduct extensive experiments on MNIST (LeCun, 1998).
 We term the weighting variance of training examples emphasis spread.
 As a side contribution, we show that the gradient estimator employed with DARN (Gregor et al., 2013), originally proposed for autoregressive models, is a strong baseline for gradient estimation in large and complex models with many stochastic layers.
 The mathematical proofs of our algorithm is detailed in supplementary materials.
 Without bells and whistles, FoveaBox gets state-of-the-art single-model results on the COCO object detection task.
 As a result, most layers are directly connected to the input and output, resulting in direct access to the gradients and the original input.
 The proposed L2L is a generic framework and can be extended to other minimax optimization problems, e.g, generative adversarial imitation learning, which is studied in Section 4.
 Our hypothesis is that if the agent learns to control the object, then the mutual information of the agent states and the object states should be relatively high.
 Interestingly, the results suggest an excellent trade-off between accuracy and robustness.
 We do so by closely examining the bounds for a block of layers composed of an affine layer, followed by a ReLU nonlinearity, followed by another affine layer under -`∞ bounded input.
it implies that methods for understanding neural networks based on analyzing highly selective single units, or finding optimal inputs for single units, such as activation maximization (Erhan et al., 2009) may be misleading".
 In terms of SNNs, (Indiveri et al., 2015) proposed a SNN architecture, named Feedforward SNN, which is based on spike-based learning and temporary learning, and it achieves 87.41% accuracy on MNIST-DVS datasets.
 In the settings considered, WeightNorm significantly reduces the amount of over-parameterization needed for provable convergence, as compared with un-normalized settings.
 Yet, IWAE suffers from the above-mentioned φ-gradient breakdown and exhibited inferior empirical performance to RWS (Le et al., 2019).
 The sparsity ratio learned by the runtime agent together with the estimated runtime importance of channels are used to generate runtime pruning structures, while the sparsity ratio learned by the static agent together with the estimated static importance of channels are used to generate static (permanent) pruning structures.
 The operation of matrix inversion is avoided by the quadratic approximation technique and a backtracking algorithm.
Overall, our contributions include the following:
 We present our results in section 5, and in Section 6 we discuss some opportunities for and limitations and risks of super-resolution.
 Hence we show a model-agnostic way to artificially increase performance on several widely used data sets.
 The implication that additional patterns learned in later stages of lrDecay are more complex and thus less transferable across different datasets, is also justified empirically.
 The benefit brought by our theoretical study is twofold.
 Second, it depends on a data ordering.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
 We discuss the relationship among our proxy, the divergence between the marginals, and non-saturating heuristics used in different but related community (Goodfellow et al., 2014).
 With this data, we can learn a metric that is not only able to directly extract and use features, but additionally knows the fundamental interactions between them.
 We further find that our method can even outperform the supervised method on infrequent words, owing to its self-supervised nature.
 Rigorous experiments conducted on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets (Lecun et al., 1998; Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009) show that our mechanism notably enhances the robustness of DP deep neural networks, compared with existing mechanisms.
 Parlos et al., (2001) proposed an algorithmic approach to do nonlinear filtering using recurrent neural network architecture but did not provide theoretical gurantee.
 Secondly, the feature vectors composed by position and classification information are much more concise than the feature vectors extracted directly by the convolutional layers(Deng et al., 2016b), which are easier to learn and get higher recognition rate.
 AutoGrow is very robust.
 Gumbel-softmax (Jang et al., 2016; Maddison et al., 2016) is further introduced to recalibrate these weights, which enables efficient gradient-based optimization during training, and more importantly, leads to sparse branch selection during inference for efficiency.
 It’s worth noting that MaskConvNet, as a general pruning framework, can be easily extended to other structured pruning categories as well as weight pruning, by re-formatting the mask variables only.
 Our contributions are summarized as follow:
 Second, a converged quantized discriminator is conductive to the convergence of the entire quantized GAN model.
 In contrast, our evaluation shows that on three datasets, in the beer and hotel domain, our model outperforms strong baselines and generates masks that are: strong feature predictors, meaningful, and interpretable compared to attention-based methods and a single-aspect masker.
 Those are not the general methods for text classification.
 Section 3 gives the new metric named duality gap that can be seen as an upper bound of traditional metrics.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
 Raissi et al., (2017) focused on continuous time models and solved the Burgers and Schrödinger equations, and Xu & Darve (2019) introduced a novel direct method for the inverse problem and demonstrated their algorithm on various PDEs.
 Since we only look at local perturbations, we can model the loss as a function of these perturbations via a Taylor series expansion.
Contributions: The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
This paper is organized as follows: We first introduce the problem setting and notation; then we explain our approach in details, and further discuss the differences among several variations; we also examine the algorithm performance in simulated study and concludes at the end.
 When applied to restricted-form invertible blocks, the model achieves constant memory usage.
 In order to avoid hurting the performance, the existing Transformer models allow for multiple heads by increasing the embedding size, which in turn increases the head size.
 In either case, for the automatic generation of viable complex 3-D structures of inorganic compounds one needs to accurately generate the locations of many atoms in 3-D space.
 A detailed comparison between the proposed method and other existing methods is summarized in Table 1.
In our Bayesian optimization NAS algorithm, we train an ensemble of neural networks to predict the mean and variance of candidate neural architectures, from which we compute the upper confidence bound (UCB) acquisition function (Srinivas et al., 2009).
 For example, changing the orientation of the object should not change the identity under our model.
 This step is regarded as global motion composition, which covers the whole temporal scale (often more than 100 steps).
 This structure retains more details of the spatial structure and pays more attention to primary features such as the edges and corners of objects, while abandoning more abstract semantic information.
 Because such a method does not currently exist, prior works relied on domain-specific metrics or visual inspection, which made unified and objective evaluations difficult.
 As previously commented, uncertainty is a good candidate for a rejection metric.
 It implies that with proper degree or control of weight sharing, better child models can be more stably found.
 Compared with ConvNet, the forward and backward embedding operations can be implemented by convolution and transposed convolution with one-hot-filters (see fig.  12 in Appendix for details).
 This point is empirically validated in our experiments.
 This indicates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.
 In contrast to most other methods, the training phase of each class can be independently executed from one another.
We train the whole network jointly, through the discriminant network of the antagonistic generation network, the front-end network was back-propagated, the input parameters were updated, and the model was optimized.
 The GRF does not require partitioning of a latent vector and can update all the node attributes in each layer.
 From this observation, we point out some possibilities for which we could expect robustness of a model for quantization from information obtained during training, we could determine an optimal policy for quantization of that model, and we could develop a novel optimization or regularization scheme.
 Ultimately, many use cases of NLP models are related to conversation with end users or analysis of structured documents.
 Likewise, they penalize it more greatly for losing (or being less preferred) in an advantageous one.
 For example, if x = 4, 5,−9, 1T and S = {1, 3}, then xS is either 4,−9T or 4, 0,−9, 0T .
To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel online distillation method that transfers the knowledge of feature maps adversarially as well as a cyclic learning framework for training more than two networks simultaneously.
 The source prototypes are computed by learning a similarity-based classifier and the target prototypes are estimated by a minimax entropy algorithm (Saito et al., 2019b).
 There we show that our estimation results admit an approximate Bayesian Nash Equilibrium for agents to report truthfully.
In this paper, we utilize the fact the privacy noise affects the optimization procedure and establish new and much tighter utility guarantees for gradient perturbation approaches.
We propose a new simple definition for calibration for regression, which is closer to the standard one for classification.
 In particular, we draw on ideas from Zaheer et al., (2017) to ensure that the discriminator acts as a function on sets and its output does not depend on the order in which the elements of the set are given as input.
 Most model personalization approaches satisfy these constraints when trained using Federated Averaging (McMahan et al., 2016), the most popular FL algorithm.
 As shown in fig.  1 (c), the HR image generated by our method can handle the noise better than ESRGAN as illustrated by the blue patch.
 The visualization is achieved by projecting the high-dimensional data or feature to a two-dimension space, using the t-SNE (Maaten & Hinton, 2008) technique.
 Furthermore, MANAS allows search directly on large datasets (e.g, ImageNet).
The ouline of the paper is as follows.
 We formulate the input reduction problem in this work as a multi-objective optimization problem: 1) minimize the amount of testing data selected from the whole testing data; 2) maximize the testing adequacy achieved by the selected testing data; and 3) maximize the similarity of output distributions achieved by the selected and the whole testing data.
Our work makes the following contributions:
The manifold hypothesis indicates that the real-world data in a high-dimensional observation space always tends to live in the vicinity of an intrinsic low dimensional manifoldRifai et al., (2011).
 Our main contributions are two-fold as follows.
 We show that these results hold for various sizes of episodic memories (between 1 and 5 examples per class per task).
In this paper, we provide an algorithm, PROJECT AND FORGET, that uses Bregman projections with cutting planes, to solve metric constrained problems with many (possibly exponentially) inequality constraints.
 We also perform many large-scale experiments on various datasets to show the efficacy of TriMap in terms of DR performance measures and runtime.
 Then, indeed, feature-robustness is upper bounded by the proposed flatness measure.
 However, for some of our more advanced analyses, convergence does become an issue and applying more advanced DMARL methods provides a promising avenue of future research.
To mitigate these issues, we propose tiMe, which learns from existing data to distill multiple value functions and MDP embeddings.
 A set of items is called a bag, whereas each individual item in the bag is called an instance.
Contributions.
 To sum up, this paper makes the following three main contributions:
 We prove that high gradient confusion may lead to slower convergence, while convergence is accelerated (and could be faster than predicted by existing theory) if confusion is low indicating a regime where constant learning rates work well in practice (sections 2 and 3).
 In this work, however, we use a provable global upper bound on the curvature (and not an estimate) as a regularizer and show that it results in high certified robustness.
 We leverage our knowledge of the search space to explore it more effectively.
 A significant body of literature on transfer in RL is focused on initialized RL in the target domain using learned source policy; known as jump-start/warm-start methods (Taylor et al., 2005; Ammar et al., 2012; 2015).
 The key aspects and contributions of TabNet are:
 One such recent example is the Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) method (Liu & Wang, 2016; Liu, 2017) that approximates a target distribution with a group of interacting particles using iterative gradient updates.
 However, we observe a considerably smaller generalization gap on real-world noise.
 To evaluate our models, we introduce two new datasets from subsets of FREEBASE, and develop baselines by extending existing models on knowledge graphs to work with hypergraphs.
 These bounds use the gradient of the loss, and an estimate of the error of the linear approximation of the loss, called the modulus of continuity.
 Furthermore, performance quickly plateaued as we increased the number of simulations past 32.
 Additionally, one has to create a question template for each entity and relation type of interest.
 We assume that f can be written as a sparse, low-degree polynomial in the (discrete) Fourier basis .
 The existing work had no agreement on the relationship between robustness in interpretation and robustness in classification.
 In this paper, we focus primarily on fully connected neural networks(FCNN) with ReLU activation function in the hidden layers.
 We call this new attack mechanism as adversarial imitation attack.
In summary, contributions of this paper are shown as follow.
 In this study, we deliberately build a more complicated dataset by adding JPG format LR images to the training data.
 The role of the latent variable is to encode distinct modes that can be related to underlying reaction classes.
 It returns a correction over the expert proposal, including uncertainty-reducing sensing actions that experts never need to take.
 This framework is entirely differentiable, allowing us to optimize the NP network along with the generators during training.
chat/rl/.
 The low-level layer policy which focuses only on achieving the sub-goal proposed by the high-level layer policy without keeping the final goal in mind, may drift away from being ultimately successful.
 This filtering can be observed when an individual is tasked with counting the number of basketball passes in a video, yet fails to register a large gorilla that appears in center frame (Chabris & Simons, 2011).
 We therefore create new datasets for the five tasks after carefully separating the pre-training and finetuning corpora.
 Throughout the paper we redirect details to supplementary materials.
In the first phase, we incrementally introduce groups of labels in the training process.
 We update the generator and the critic alternatively until the synthesized data cannot be distinguished from the real one, which we will show later that it gives T → T ′ theoretically.
 As a result, we do not require handicraft rules to feed the gaps between sub-actions since they are provided by conditional queries.
 Given the optimized model and all possible attribute-object pairs, the recognition is realized using a voting inference method.
 Our main contributions are:
 We firstly propose Heuristic Machine Truth Serum (HMTS).
 Nevertheless, these sampling methods have not really been shown to lead to the convergence to a global minimum even when the underlying function f(·) is convex, albeit some motivating toy examples or some analysis (but not related to the convergence) are provided.
 Archetypal analysis represents each subject as a convex combination of “archetypes”, which are optimized to be diverse yet still be close to the convex hull of the subjects’ feature vectors.
 However, when the score s(x) is less than τ , the information in the score s(x) is never used.
 Comprehensive experiments show the advantage of our method on both recognition accuracy and computation efficiency.
To summarize, the contributions of this paper are as follows:
We apply our method, as well as various existing methods, to two previously proposed lowdimensional time series segmentation problems, namely a 1d bouncing ball, and a 2d moving arm.
 This result is encouraging as it is able to remove the long-standing requirement of learning error rates of noises (or estimating transition matrices as used in many relevant papers) before many of the existing methods can be applied.
 Additionally, Chen et al., (2018) requires an additional optimization step for grouping words, and lacks end-to-end training through back-propagation.
 Therefore, Chordal-GCN exploits the sparsity pattern as well as the clustering structure of the graph without any approximation or random sampling, while requires similar memory space to Cluster-GCN.
 AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) proposed to fix the weight decay regularization in Adam by decoupling the weight decay from the gradient update and this improves the generalization performance of Adam.
 Finally by properly choosing the step size, gradient descent update indeed produces small enough perturbation.
 The architecture search is both efficient and flexible.
 For illustration, an example of a right-skewed distribution is shown in fig. 1(b), and the masks predicted based on the distributions controllers with the right-skewed to the left-skewed are displayed in fig. 1(c).
 Our memory networks are standard networks with additional capabilities.
 As a consequence, it is not applicable to improve the performance by enlarging the training set.
 However, it is challenging to define meta features artificially.
JAX MD has so far implemented simple pairwise potentials (Lennard-Jones, soft-sphere, Morse) and the embedded atom method (EAM) (Daw & Baskes, 1984).
As a base model for analysis, we build a proof of concept model named gfNN (Figure 2).
 Sun et al., (2019) fuses multi-scale features with a multi-branch framework to learn robust representations.
 We present results from real ErrP experiments to evaluate the acceleration in learning, and sample efficiency, in both frameworks.
Since the improvement realized by GAN-TSC depends on the synthetic data quality, we further propose to use GAN-TSC to evaluate the quality of synthetic datasets and their generators.
 In summary, our major contributions are summarized as follows:
 This is similar to learning to generate images in a few-shot setting (Reed et al., 2017), with the distinction that instead of learning to generate holistic images from few examples, we learn properties from examples in a way that can then be flexibly combined with other previously learned concepts.
 This prior-weighted distance weights each input datapoint point by the corresponding value of the multivariate Gaussian PDF evaluated at that point’s latent representation.
 In Schmidt et al., (2018), the authors proved that in this case, the labeled sample complexity for robust generalization is significantly larger than that for standard generalization.
 To this end, we employ simple pairwise loss functions (e.g, margin loss, binomial deviance loss) and propose a flexible distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework for defining a robust loss over pairs within a mini-batch.
 Thus, we obtain best of both worlds: better long-term prediction and model compression.
 Numerous regularization approaches based on weight scaling such as in (Cho & Lee, 2017) have been proposed to improve the performance of learned models.
 Based on the techniques, we can connect a generalization analysis to the invariance of deep neural networks.
Summary of contributions:
 Especially, memorization can be affected by many factors, e.g, data sets, network architectures, and the choice of the optimizers.
 In addition to improving predictive performance with a relatively small training set, our model is fast to train since it uses a pre-trained model for the siamese sub-network.
 The proposed RL framework is independent of how adversarial examples are generated, and thus could be combined with white-box or black-box attacks.
 Interestingly, we prove that∑ t I(Ω, At|St) is an upper bound on empowerment, which we minimize, in addition to maximizing the VIC lower bound JV IC .
The contributions of this paper are thus threefold.
Inspired by recent success of GANs (Karras et al., 2018a;b) and normalizing flows (Kingma et al., 2016; Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018), we develop a new model called Latently Invertible Autoencoder (LIA).
 However, the hard thresholding complexity of ASBCDHT still scales linearly with κs̃, which is usually expensive for real-world sparse learning problems.
Typically, the MAML algorithms only focus on objective (1); that was the original motivation in Finn et al., (2017).
 If for any > 0, the hyperparameters satisfy one of the following(i) β ∈ 0, 1), m = Ω( −1 1−β ), T = Θ( −2), η = Θ(m2β−1), n = Ω̃( −4),(ii) β = 0, m = Θ̃( −3/2), T = Θ̃( −1), η = Θ(m−1), n = Ω̃( −2).then with high probability over the random initialization and choice of samples of size n, the gradient descent with a learning rate η achieves an expected -classification error within T -iterations.
 Our contributions are summarized as follows.
 Theoretically analysing the signal from D, we obtain two metric functions to measure the distributional difference.
 Furthermore, to tackle the long-tail distribution, an unbalanced sampled-softmax is developed to adjust the gradient penalty of the infrequent predicates.
Satisfying the precision requirement alone is not sufficient, since the classification objective is still directly associated with the learner, and thus the hallucinator continues to rely on the back-propagated signal to update its parameters.
 In particular, the agent iteratively acts on every undetermined vertex for either (a) determining the membership of the vertex in the solution or (b) deferring the determination to be made in later steps (see Figure 1 for illustration).
 With `∞ perturbations, we find that RST improves standard accuracy by 4−6% while maintaining or even improving the robustness achieved by the vanilla adversarial training counterpart.
In the experiments on image-classification tasks of the CIFAR-10/100 (Krizhevsky, 2009) datasets using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method exhibits better performance for up to approximately 75% compressed models than slimmable networks and US-Nets.
Our contributions:
 Through meta goal-generation learning, we expect our method can still accelerate the acquisition of such tasks.
 The problem which only obtains some Pareto optimal policies in MORL is called preference MORL.
 The loss considers the decision boundaries of pre-trained classifiers and minimizes the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD, Gretton et al., 2012) between the original dataset and the generated dataset.
 The attack accuracy reaches nearly 80% when the target associational model is trained on 60K training samples and used to predict test data that belong to a different distribution than the training data.
 In these cases, the communication cost is reduced by 7 fold.
 However the batch size at which the test accuracy begins to degrade can be larger than previously thought.
 We write an = O(bn) if an ≤ Cbn for some constant C > 0 and an = Õ(bn) if an = O(bn) up to some logarithmic terms of bn.
 We show that designs with multiple prizes outperform awarding a single first prize in terms of principal utility.
We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on two applications, namely for the segmentation of SEM images of food microstructure and stained histology images of glandular tissues.
 This motivates DeepXML to have specialized architectures for head and tail labels which lead to accuracy gains not only in standard metrics which assign equal weights to all labels but also in propensity scored metrics (Jain et al., 2016) designed specifically for long-tail extreme classification.
 Some information about the location of the peak in each period has to be taken into account in order to detect this kind of change.
 (Hénaff et al., 2019) and (Bachman et al., 2019) achieve impressive linear classifier probe metrics for their representations that were trained contrastively to maximize mutual information across views and space.
In some applications, if the domain of anomalous and normal samples is well defined, anomaly detection can be reduced to binary classification problems.
 This is in line with recent studies (He et al., 2016; Cortes et al.,; Huang et al., 2017), which have shown that better performance can be achieved by highly overparameterized networks, i.g,, networks with far more parameters than the number of training samples.
Carefully handcrafted heuristics, embedded with problem-specific knowledge, are usually efficient for large search space (Dufourd et al., 1996).
 In AdaGAN, the generator encapsulates Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) for style transfer, and the discriminator is responsible for adversarial training.
 We let eT represent the embedding (i.g,, output of f ) associated with some example containing classes T .
 We call this proposed approach as MCMAE with the Domain discriminator (MCMAE-D).
 In particular, the functional maps framework and its variants (Ovsjanikov et al., 2012; 2016).

 On the dataset augmentation task, quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the ability of Hydra to generate new sentences while preserving labels.
 Structural zeroes and parameter tying, if chosen carefully, should help us avoid overfitting to coincidental patterns in the data.
 We call this variation QSGDinf.
 This approach, illustrated in figure 1, addresses the limitation of Euclidean point based representations where no distinction is made between generic class representations and specific instance representations.
 OTCOARSENING consists of two ingredients: a parameterized graph coarsening strategy in the algebraic multigrid (AMG) style; and an optimal transport that minimizes the structural transportation between two consecutive graphs in the hierarchy.
 It can be optimized either directly by the original image processing network, or through an intermediate transforming network.
Our main contributions are the following:
 1.For uncertainty modeling, we assume the point of view Osband et al., (2018), which uses ensembles to approximate posterior distribution.
 Meanwhile, they also suffer their intrinsic drawbacks.
We validate the performance of FICM in a variety of benchmark environments, including Atari 2600 (Bellemare et al., 2013), Super Mario Bros.
 Such contextual information encourages the learning of temporally-aware multimodal representations.

 Through exhaustive numerical experiments, the resulted network RW-LISTA is proven on the superiority over existing methods in solving CSS recovery.
 In addition, the iterative method dynamically stops when the learned graph structure approaches close enough to the optimal graph based on our proposed stopping criterion.
We summarize the main contributions as three-fold.
Related work on RNN certification The work of (Ko et al., 2019) proposes the POPQORN verifier for recurrent neural networks (RNN).
Often, there are several topic-word associations in different domains, e.g, in topics Z1-Z3.
 Finally, we study which part of the policy optimization system should be regularized, and conclude that generally only regularizing the policy network suffices, as imposing regularization on value networks usually does not help.
 See fig.  1 for a visualization that uses initialized scribbles as input.
 A primitive system may be given easy puzzles, while an advanced system may be given hard puzzles (or puzzles targeting a specific discovered weakness).
 Experimental results demonstrate that the proximal pruned BERT model keeps high accuracy on a wide range of downstream tasks, including SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; 2018) and GLUE (Wang et al., 2018).
 Lastly, it is trained end-to-end.
 Meanwhile DTS achieves scalability of 0.72 without compromising the accuracy.
 Similarly, players aiming to minimize an averaged loss might play differently from players that greedily minimize the loss after every move.
 It means that every layer of the network can express the target distribution progressively.
 This framework empirically performs much better than previous approaches quantitatively, with very inspiring examples.
 Our work and that of Gadelha et al., (2017) are special cases of AmbientGAN for 3D shape learning.

Our main contributions are as follows:
 However, we argue that the continuous Sinkhorn procedure (in training stage) is yet an unnatural approximation to Hungarian sampling (in testing stage) for discretization.
 We conclude the paper by summarizing our findings (section 5).
 Moreover, it is able to control the estimation bias varying from positive to negative which helps improve learning efficiency as we will show in next sections.
 It has the same range and minima structure as the `0 norm.
 Therefore the convergence analysis for constrained problems is much more involved than unconstrained problems.
 The edges of an infinite grid graph have zero curvature.
 Gillenwater et al., (2014) proposed an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to update marginal kernel DPP K = L(L + I)−1, together with a baseline K-Ascent derived from projected gradient ascent (Levitin & Polyak, 1966).
 However, in Zhou et al., (2016); Zhang et al., (2018a), they use asymmetric or non-linear quantization, causing barriers to BN fusion.
Our weakly supervised clustering framework is illustrated in Figure 1.
The contribution of this paper is threefold:
 The ensemble method is shown to produce superior results than individual policies with an equivalent amount of computation.
Contributions:
 In real-world settings, the type of attack is not known beforehand.
 APoT quantization enjoys an approximate 2× multiplication speed-up compared with uniform quantization on both generic and specific hardware.
Furthermore, to enable a solid research on knowledge consistency, we consider the following issues.
 In Section 2, we give a formal definition of MAML, and discuss related works.
 Bengio (2017) brought the notion of attentive awareness from cognitive science into deep learning in his consciousness prior proposal.
In experiments, we evaluate MI on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009) under the oblivious attacks (Carlini & Wagner, 2017) and the adaptive attacks (Athalye et al., 2018).
 Specifically, in the MMC loss, we first preset untrainable class centers with optimal inter-class dispersion in the feature space according to Pang et al., (2018), then we encourage the features to gather around the centers by minimizing the squared distance similar with the center loss.
 While there exist prior work on detecting the arrow of time in videos (Pickup et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2018) and time-series data (Peters et al., 2009; Bauer et al., 2016), we believe our work to be the first towards measuring it in the context of reinforcement learning.
Without loss of generality, we assume that the random variable X follows a(n unknown) joint probability distribution Pr(X |Γ,∆,Υ ), treatment T follows Pr(T |Γ,∆ ), and outcome Y T follows PrT (Y T |∆,Υ ), where Γ, ∆, and Υ represent the three underlying factors1 that generate an obser1 Examples for: (Γ) rich patients receiving the expensive treatment while poor patients receiving the cheap one – although outcomes of the possible treatments are not particularly dependent on patients’ wealth status; (∆) younger patients receiving surgery while older patients receiving medication; and (Υ) genetic information that determines the efficacy of a medication, however, such relationship is unknown to the attending physician.
 Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can not only cover all of the modes, but also avoid generating spurious samples (mode mixture).
 The divided data is then used to train the other network.
 Using these two subsets, we explore different ways to re-train the same network, and evaluate its robustness against white-box PGD20 (step size /10) attacks on the test dataset.
We further analyze the dependence of the convergence rate e−s(m)t and optimal hyper-parameters on the mini-batch size m.
 The full proof, including proofs of intermediate results, is included in the Appendix.
 Empirically, when the model capacity increases, the RNN does not forget much even if the entire network is fine-tuned.
 We therefore experiment with different policy network distillation schemes for fast control without MPC.
Our model consists of two components.
 (2)As we will show, the recursive dynamics of SGD with heavy ball momentum helps in amplifying the escape signal γ, which allows it to escape saddle points faster.
 This suggests repeated fine-tuning might provide protection against a range of adversaries.
 However, it only trained the autoencoder to reconstruct the input, and it did not take advantage of the information of a pretrained network.
 The authors provide a novel strategy of argument when proving the upper bound for the sample complexity of exploration, namely identifying a sufficient condition for optimality, and then bound the number of times that this condition is violated.
Our empirical results on LeNet-300-100 for MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998) and VGG-16 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) for CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky, 2009) demonstrate that our framework based on coresets of neurons outperforms sampling-based coresets by improving compression without sacrificing the accuracy.
 Therefore, the local minima with respect to the variable Ŵ are also the global minima in the cell; and then (2) we prove that the local optimality is maintained under the constructed mapping.
 Instead of relying on expert experience, we try to learn a better synchronization policy using a reinforcement learning (RL) approach with training data being obtained by observing the execution process of PS-based distributed SGD.
 We can leverage the action semantics information to improve an agent’s policy/Q network design toward more efficient multiagent learning.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:• Theory.
 This allows OPIQ to maintain optimism when selecting actions and bootstrapping, since the Q+-values can be optimistic even when the Q-values are not.
 While the loss on the text-only corpus is of the standard MLM loss in BERT, improving the generalization on long and complex sentences.
 The Gap is based on the difference between the parameters used to calculate the gradient and the parameters on which the gradient is applied.
 Finally, Section 5 concludes this work.
 Furthermore, we transfer our CR-ResNet and CR-MobileNetV2 into the another ERF-sensitive task, instance segmentation, by using the Mask RCNN (He et al., 2017) framework.
 Rather, it is intended to be an attempt to set up a standardized and uniform evaluation framework for GNNs, such that future contributions can be compared fairly and objectively with existing architectures.
 Perhaps the more relevant bound has the flavor of “relative error”; it is especially strong when the training loss is small, as is often the case in modern practice.
 We use gt to denote the gradient of ft(·) at xt.
 As shown in (1), GAIL aims to find a policy, which attains an average reward similar to that of the expert policy with respect to any reward belonging to the function classR.
 In this paper, we show that if we craft an image that produces an activation vector such that one neuron is large and others are almost zero (the right side of Figure 1), it triggers the class for which the weight associated to that neuron is higher in the linear combination.
 By replacing filter generators with basis generators, the proposed method becomes highly efficient and practical.
 Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:
 b) The above methods employ random sampling in constructing queries to the model while our construction is adaptive.
 Decreasing the learning rate empirically results in a decrease in the full gradient magnitude.
 In Section 3 we analyze the expected number of FLOPs, for which we derive an exact expression.
 The techniques of (Wei and Ma, 2019) could not remove this dependency because they relied on smooth activations.
 Since the embeddings of all candidate documents can be precomputed and indexed, the inference can be done efficiently with approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms in the embedding space (Shrivastava & Li, 2014; Guo et al., 2016).
 In Appendix A, we survey different approaches for training Bayesian neural networks including sampling-free assumed density filtering (Minka, 2001; Soudry et al., 2014; Hernández-Lobato & Adams, 2015; Ghosh et al., 2016), sampling-based variational inference (Graves, 2011; Blundell et al., 2015; Shridhar et al., 2019), as well as sampling-free variational inference (Wu et al., 2018), probabilistic neural networks (Wang et al., 2016; Shekhovtsov & Flach, 2018; Gast & Roth, 2018), quantized neural network (Han et al., 2015; Courbariaux et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2016; Kim & Smaragdis, 2016; Zhou et al., 2016; Rastegari et al., 2016; Hubara et al., 2017; Esser et al., 2015; Peters & Welling, 2018; Shayer et al., 2017), and tensor networks and tensorial neural networks (Grasedyck et al., 2013; Orús, 2014; Cichocki et al., 2016; 2017; Su et al., 2018; Newman et al., 2018; Robeva & Seigal, 2017).
 Mishkin et al., (2019) benchmarked classical (mapping + planning) and learning-based methods for agents with RGB-D and GPS+Compass sensors on PointGoal Navigation (Anderson et al., 2018a) (PointGoalNav), see fig.  1, and showed that classical methods outperform learning-based.
 This is in stark contrast to prior dynamic DNN optimization methods that focus only on reducing the inference cost.
 Therefore, the meta-architecture and meta-weights need to be optimized jointly across different tasks, which is a typical bilevel optimization problem (Liu et al., 2018b).
 Intuitively, the locality part of this property suggests that the neural networks can efficiently fit the label of an input without significantly affecting most examples that have been well fitted.
 We say mostly because even with random initialization, examples that are syntactically close are treated similarly (e.g, two images differing in the intensities of some pixels as opposed to two images where one is a translated version of the other).
 To do so we drawn inspiration from a model of human associative memory called REMERGE (Kumaran & McClelland, 2012).
 However, we hypothesize that it is not true in many cases.
Incremental RNN (iRNN) achieves Identity Gradient.
 We substitute batch statistics involved in BP and FP with different type of moving average statistics respectively, and theoretical analysis is given to prove the benefits.
 Our model nonparametrically fits the underlying intensity function.
 As a hard version of this regularization technique, we also show that pruning, i.g,, preventing the most important model parameters from any change and learning new tasks with the remaining parameters, can be also integrated into UCB.
 One possible way to alleviate this problem is to seek an upper bound of the 0-1 loss that is still efficient to optimize but tighter than conventional (convex) losses.
We make the following key contributions:
In the remainder of this paper, we investigate whether the smoothness assumption is satisfied for various GAN losses.
Notation.
 This viewpoint makes explicit the connection between our methods and early stopping.
 In some specific tasks such as dictionary learning and blind deconvolution, optimization over the unit sphere has been widely practiced, such as in Sun et al., (2015); Bai et al., (2018); Zhang et al., (2018); Kuo et al., (2019).
 This is because location and energy are unrelated most of the time and become related only when the event of interest occurs.
 In the experiment, we conducted a set of ablation studies related to each novelty.
 In fact, it is possible to train the oracle using unsupervised learning only, with a dataset consisting of correct input-output examples DU .
 We demonstrate controlled generation with a number of attribute controllers, assembled and combined during generation, each with a different strength, acting as a set of “control knobs” that tune generation towards the desired attribute (see examples in Table 1).
 Finally, we validate our work on multiple benchmark datasets for few-shot classification.
 Rényi correlation captures nonlinear dependence between random variables.
 OT-SI efficiently leverages even a small amount of side information and it generalizes well to new, unannotated data.
 Our contributions are summarized below:
This theorem, which extends Proposition 2.27 in Golubitsky & Stewart (2002) to sets of vectors using multivariate polynomials, lends itself to expressing arbitrary equivariant polynomials as a composition of entry-wise continuous functions and a single linear transmission, which in turn facilitates the proof of Theorem 1.
 Key aspects of the empirical performance of local SGD compared to mini-batch baselines are illustrated in Figure 1.
 We provide detailed evaluations in the experiments.
 Our approach, “Reinforced Genetic Algorithm Learning” (REGAL), uses the network’s ability to generalize to new graphs to significantly improve the solution quality of the genetic algorithm for the same objective evaluation budget.
 Our experiments and ablations in this realistic simulation reveal the effectiveness of our proposed approach for the task of exploration.
Ours is not the first study of M-BERT.
 In addition, we predict the performance of an algorithm from its structure and operations, thus trying the most promising algorithms early in our search.
 The tasks are set in a procedurallygenerated 3D world, and require complex behavior (e.g, tool use, long-horizon memory) from the agent to succeed.
 Latent optimization is very effective at learning disentangled representations at training time, however, it is not useful for obtaining class and content codes of unseen test images.
The contribution of this work can be summarized as follows:
In our experiment, our method achieves 75.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet dataset around 360M FLOPs, which is 0.9% higher than state-of-the-art model (Stamoulis et al., 2019a).
 Despite their modeling power, none of the estimators are capable of providing accurate estimation of MI with low variance when the MI is large and the batch size is small (Poole et al., 2019).
 In particular, using our characterization we show the following
To empirically justify our ideas, we conduct experiments in two different settings.
 Experiments also show that our proposed attacks are more transferable given their large and structured perturbations (Papernot et al., 2016).
 Furthermore, we showcase the ability of SCALOR to operate on natural-scene videos containing tens of objects with a dynamic background.
Contributions.
 Consider a rotation equivariant network receiving two copies of the same face (fig. 2a).
 The model is based on a probabilistic version of a decision tree.
 Intuitively, these errors will be small close to the training points, but large far from them.
Contributions.
 The parameter update is triggered by the occurrence of spike and the gradient is computed based on the time difference between the current time step and the most recent time step the neuron generated an output spike.
 This way the fine-tuned model can still learn the behavior of the source model.
 We maximize the mutual information between intermediate representations of the two models so that the student model learns from the teacher model.
We make the following three contributions in this work:
Our specific contributions in this paper are:
 On an imbalanced dataset, our algorithm is the only method that achieves accuracy parity; however it does so at the cost of decreased utility.
To solve such difficulties, we reformulate the DoS as a distribution and develop a new framework based on nonparametric estimation.
 The following are our main contributions.
 We further present evidence that multi-agent co-adaptation may scale better with environment complexity and qualitatively centers around more human-interpretable behavior than intrinsically motivated agents.
 Our strategy is in contrast to naïve strategies that either leverage only at graph-level properties (Figure 1 (a.ii)) or node-level properties (Figure 1 (a.i)).
 Learning with noisy labels with or without additional clean data has been a problem of long-standing interest in ML (Khetan et al., 2018; Zhang & Sabuncu, 2018; Ren et al., 2018b; Veit et al., 2017; Shen & Sanghavi, 2019).
In this paper, we derive a unified framework to obtain a compression based bound for a noncompressed network.
 However, unlike CNNs, it is difficult for multi-layer MPNNs to learn good representations for disassortative graphs because of two reasons.
Contributions.
 A computationally cheap but high quality branching strategy is thus much needed.
 Interestingly, for complex, “high-rank” games, SV-RL performs comparably.
(ii) The number of RNA data points is limited, so we cannot expect that a naive fully connected network can learn the predictive information and constraints directly from data.
 It was recently shown how deep neuronal auto-encoders enabled unsupervised learning of goal representations in IMGEPs from raw pixel perception of a robot’s visual scene (Laversanne-Finot et al., 2018).
 Our work improves model interpretablility and increases trust in attribution results.
This much said, research in capsule networks is still in its infancy, and several issues have to be overcome before capsule networks can become universally applicable like CNNs.
 First, the expectation of the gradient is no longer an unbiased estimation; and, second, the gradient of f(x̃s) at the snapshot is formed by two random subsets, which are used for the functions Fi and Gj respectively.
 The key concept is that we should not treat all examples equally, neither should we let only a few be emphasised and contribute to the training.
 Compared with the anchor-based RetinaNet, FoveaBox gets 2.2 AP gains, which also surpasses most of previously published anchor based single-model results.
 So we make a hypothesis that dense wirings in topology benefit the optimization process.
Different from the hand-designed methods that compute the adversarial perturbation for each individual sample using gradients from backpropagation, our methods generate the perturbations for all samples through the shared attacker g.
 Interestingly, this automated RL scheme bears similarities to the self-supervised learning of feature representations in computer vision tasks, where a neural network is trained to predict a part of the image given another part of the same image (Doersch et al., 2015).
 Moreover, we show that networks that are trained to be robust against Gaussian attacks using our proposed regularizer enjoy orders of magnitude boost in robustness against a family of other types of attacks.
 In fact, we propose new expected bounds for this block of layers, which we prove to be not only supersets to the true bounds of this block in expectation but also very tight to the true bounds.
 This makes a direct comparison between selectivity measures all the more important.
 (Stromatias et al., 2015) proposed a composite system, including convolutional SNNs, non-spiking fully connected classifier, and spiking output layer with its performance of 97.95% of accuracy.
 The decomposition of the NTK also connects to observations of 12 that discuss “lazy training” which refers to a training regime where the weights of the network stay close to their initialization (see Section 6).
 • Experiments.
 Thus, it is not clear whether the multi-sample objective approach of IWAE or the adaptive importance-sampling approach of RWS is preferable.
 By considering both the pruning structures, our framework is able to provide a trade-off between storage efficiency and dynamic flexibility for runtime channel pruning.
 Moreover, while existing methods require typically strict and complex conditions, such as Kurdyka-ojasiewicz (KL) properties (Lau et al., (2018)) to prove convergence, our proposed method requires simple and mild conditions to guarantee convergence and covers most of the commonly-used loss functions and activation functions, and the choice of hyperparameters has no effect on the convergence of our DLAM algorithm theoretically.
 A comparison between the proposed explanation and the common beliefs is summarized in Table 1.
 A bad ordering often deteriorates the performance, but it is hard to guard against such a bad situation.
The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.
 The central contributions of our work are:

The contributions of ISBNet can be summarized as follows:
 We would like to leave it for future work.
 A method for accelerating Euclidean distance computation has also been proposed to solve the bottleneck of k-means.
 ODE solvers can guarantee that the estimated solution is within a given error tolerance of the true solution.
 Third, quantizing both the discriminator and generator is more stable than only quantizing generator networks.
 We show that it can be a benefit to 1) guide the model to focus on different parts of the input text, and 2) further improve the sentiment prediction for all aspects.
In order to solve these problems, we propose a novel deep multi-input model for text classification.
 In Section 4, we establish a generalization error bound under the new metric and show that the empirical duality gap can be viewed as the loss function for GANs.
 In Section 2 we state the problem and review existing methods.
 This learning rule is mathematically equivalent to a version of error backpropagation in a reinforcement learning setting that trains one output unit at a time selected by an -greedy mechanism.
In this work we address the forward and inverse PDE problems via a direct unsupervised method.
 We then make a quadratic approximation, and solve for the optimal perturbation in the learning rate which will minimize the loss.
 However, larger embedding size, in addition to increasing the number of parameters, makes it expensive to use the model and the learned embeddings in downstream tasks, as the downstream model sizes scale with the embedding size of the tokens.
In this work, we focus specifically on proposing an effective 3-D representation for this class of molecules that can not be represented in the same ways as many smaller molecules.
 The Transformer distillation and two-stage learning framework are two key ideas of the proposed method.
 Finally, we use a mutation algorithm to optimize the acquisition function.
This problem setup can occur under many situations such as learning approximate models of simulators, 3D reconstructions, speaker recognition (from speech), and even real-world data processing in the human brain as in the hunter-gatherer example above.
 On two human motion datasets, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing parametric and non-parametric baselines.
 To solve the problem that the size of the receptive field of the shallow structure is limited, this paper introduces the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module (Chen et al., 2018).
 Thus, we construct a unified evaluation metric that dispenses with domain-specific knowledge and considers not only the topology but also node/edge labels by combining a graph kernel and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) (Gretton et al., 2012).
 In literature, we find examples of different rejection functions (Geifman & El-Yaniv, 2019) (De Stefano et al., 2000) and some of them use uncertainty measures (Geifman & El-Yaniv, 2017) for rejection.
To summarize, our main contributions are as follows:
 Note that the encoder-decoder part can be implemented by multiple convolution layers with kernel size (1,1) and non-linear activations.
Historically, the Linearized Bregman Iteration (LBI) was firstly proposed in applied mathematics as iterative regularization paths for image reconstruction and compressed sensing (Osher et al., 2005; Yin et al., 2008), later applied to logistic regression (Shi et al., 2013).
 Up to our knowledge, this is the first time that a BoN type algorithm of all the three aspects above is addressed in literature.
The contributions of our work are :
 Finally, the convergence was achieved and The Turing test was passed successfully.
 Thus, a 100 layer-stacked flow model can apply the (non-linear) mappings 100 times for each attribute of the latent vector of the 100-node graph.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
 In such cases, discourse analysis (i.g, the ability to parse high-level textual structures that take into account the global context) is a prerequisite for human level performance.
 In addition, the magnitudes of rewards and penalties are proportional to the contribution of the individual item to its group.
 It will always be clear from context which meaning is intended.
 Unlike the direct aligning method, our adversarial distillation method enables a network to learn the overall feature map distribution of the co-trained network (fig.  1(b)).
 Second, we align the label distributions in the context of SFD by estimating the target label distribution.
 Furthermore, in our estimation framework, we use a generative adversarial approach to reconstruct the distribution from the elicited samples.
 Our contribution can be summarized as follows.
 Calibration for classification can be viewed as expecting the output for every single data point to correctly predict its error, in terms of misclassification probability.
In addition, we model the generator as a multi-task deep network capable of taking dosages as an input; this gives us the flexibility to learn heterogeneous dose-response curves for the different treatments.
 Moreover, better details can be reproduced as shown in the red patch.
 Compared to the raw data distribution, the embedding space of the conventional denoising autoencoder shows a better clustering ability while with some background noise.
 This is done by quantifying how much the estimates differ from accurately computed ground truth values between subsets of commonly used datasets.
 In Section 2, we present a brief summary of state-of-the-art methods for 3 related problems: adversarial example detection, out-of-distribution example detection and uncertainty estimation.
 These objectives take into account the efficiency, completeness, and effectiveness of testing in order to make the performance estimation more reliable.
 In this paper we propose a dual generation model, which can fully make use of the characteristics of data in low-dimensional latent space to help the network better learn and generate point cloud data.
 Inspired by EVT based open set recognition (Bendale & Boult, 2016) for Softmax prediction layers, this model architecture gives rise to a natural way of open set recognition with statistical outlier rejection on the basis of the approximate posterior in Bayesian inference.
 Finally, we perform an ablation study to show that learning anchors in hindsight is a critical factor to achieve state-of-the-art performance.
 In fact, the algorithm is a general purpose one that can solve large constrained convex optimization problems, not only those arising from metric constraints.
 To finally connect the two local properties of robustness and flatness to generalization, we necessarily need a notion describing how representative the given samples are for the true distribution.
Contribution
tiMe is a flexible and scalable pipeline with inductive biases to encourage accurate MDP identity inference and rich supervision to maximize generalization.
 In other words, a bag of instances is considered to be one data point (Foulds & Frank, 2010).
 We note that most of the baseline methods failed to the extent of achieving performance close to random chance.
 We use this gradient confusion condition as the main proxy, to study the effect of various architecture choices on convergence.
State-of-the-art results for both vision and language tasks are reported in Table 3 and 4.
 Moreover, previous works have tried to certify robustness by bounding the Lipschitz constant of the neural network (Szegedy et al., 2014; Peck et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018c; Anil et al., 2018; Hein & Andriushchenko, 2017).
 We propose a parameterization of partitioning strategies to reduce the size of the search space by eliminating unnecessary redundancies and more compactly expressing the key features that distinguish different architectures.
 Some examples of these transfer architectures include transfer between similar tasks (Banerjee & Stone, 2007), transfer from human demonstrations (Peters & Schaal, 2006) and transfer from simulation to real (Peng et al., 2017a; Ross et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2017).
 It has been shown that, in the large particle number limit, the empirical distribution of the parameters can be modeled by a nonlinear PDE, which can be viewed as a gradient flow of a convex loss function under a Wasserstein-type but non-local metric (Liu, 2017; Lu et al., 2019).
 This does not mean that real-world noise is easier to tackle.
 We evaluate the proposed methods on standard binary and non-binary datasets.
 These theoretical bounds show that small loss gradient and a small modulus of continuity are sufficient conditions for adversarial robustness.
 This property did not hold when we initialized tree search withan untrained policy.
In this study, we propose an end-to-end model for joint NER and RE which addresses all of these issues.
 If the sparsity assumption is satisfied, then we claim the function f can be reconstructed using a very small number of sub-network evaluations, thus reducing overall compute time.
 Spurred by that, we attempt to explore this relationship from both attack and defense perspectives.
 Our main contributions are as follows:
 Compared with current substitute attacks, our adversarial imitation attack requires less training data.
 To be specific, we have three kinds of training inputs: C-JPG LR, LR, and HR images.
 Even though the training data only presents one reaction for each target molecule, our model learns to associate each reaction with a latent class, and in the process covers multiple reaction classes across the training set.
Our key contribution is the following:
We note that with this strategy, we significantly increase the expressivity of each generator over the previous disconnected manifold models.
 Experimental results (detailed in Section 4) show that, on both data sets our MCTS algorithm obtains (within reasonable time) statistically much better results with respect to all the existing learning based algorithms.
 Through this platform we collected human responses to a set of over 40 different dialog models over the course of several months.
 This is equivalent to the scenario that without the long-term goal to provide human beings a clear direction and focus down the road, our short-term achievements are not likely to add up to something substantial.
 Even outside the moment to moment, changes in an individual’s behavior is guided by the structure of their values, self-selected or otherwise.
 To evaluate CuBERT’s effectiveness on a more complex task, we create a task for joint classification, localization and repair of variable misuse bugs (Vasic et al., 2019), which involves predicting two pointers.
We make the following contributions:
 Data, corresponding to labels not yet introduced to the model, use a single fake label selected from within the dataset.
 Our contributions are summarized below:
Specifically, the packing problem requires three mutual conditioned sub-actions: box selecting, rotating and positioning.
 In the experiments, we compare our model with several state-of-the-art models on two challenging public datasets.
 In HMTS, we pair each baseline classifier (an agent) with a regressor model, which is trained to predict the peer prediction information using a processed training dataset.
 Applied to topic modeling, the archetypes are the topics, with each archetype specifying a particular topic’s word distribution.
 Thus, there is a clear waste of information.
 Leading to the possibility of ticket generation and selection on any public dataset, resulting in lower privacy cost.
 We achieve state-of-the-art results without modifying the base networks.
 For example, CE can be integrated into ResNet and MobileNet V2, forming a series of CE-Networks by replacing the ordinary ‘BN-ReLU’ block by ‘BN-CE-ReLU’ block, which merely introduces subtle extra computational complexity.
 In the 1d case, the dynamics are piecewise linear, and all methods perform perfectly.
 We also provide preliminary results on how peer loss generalizes to multi-class classification problems.
 Shi & Yu (2018) also requires an additional step for performing k-means clustering for generating the quantization matrix.
Our contribution is summarized as follows:
 AdaBound (Luo et al., 2019) applies dynamic bound of learning rate on Adam and make them smoothly converge to a constant final step size as in SGD.
 Besides the forward/backward stability, the key step to show our global convergence is a new gradient upper bound which is tighter than previous works by exploiting the scaling factor τ .
The first issue is still problematic.
 Furthermore, we introduce classification losses to optimize mask predictors, which removes all constraints and avoid non-trivial hyper-parameter tuning.
 Though not our primary experimental focus, Section 4 shows they can learn tasks which require performing classification alongside storage and recall.
Multi-Scale Issue.
 Kim et al., (2017) learned meta features of problems by deep metric learning.
 It can also work with the Atomic Simulation Environment (Larsen et al., 2017) and other first-principles calculations that can be accessed from Python (e.g, Quantum Espresso (Giannozzi et al., 2009)).
 This model adopts the two steps simplification from SGC with two major differences: 1.
Inspired by the observations above, we propose a unified framework to mutually learn from input resolution and network width.
 In summary, the novel contributions of our work are
 In essence, we declare a synthetic dataset to be of higher quality if a compressed model trained on that data achieves higher test accuracy.
 This allows new concepts to be added on demand in a continual manner by simply learning a new energy function from examples, and which again can be combined with all past concepts.
 The prior-weighted L2 distance encourages points with a high reconstruction error, as we assume outliers have, to be placed in low-probability regions in the latent space.
 Our proposed method has gained a MOS score higher than previous methods, and get a VQA performance improvement of about 1.
 As an extension of this work, we prove that in this case, the labeled sample complexity for robust generalization can be the same as that for standard generalization if we have enough unlabeled data.
 The idea of DRO is to assign different weights to different pairs that are optimized by maximizing the weighted loss over an uncertainty set for the distributional variable.
 Recently, Brea et al., (2019) studied the existence of permutation plateaus in which the neurons in the layer of a network can all be permuted at the same cost.
We summarize the contributions of this paper as follow:
 It is exactly such complex dependency make the design of proper sample-selection rules a hard problem, which motivates us to solve the problem by AutoML techniques.
 Furthermore, it does not require another NN to smooth out its predictions as is the case with post-classification approaches, while achieving comparable performance gain.
 This shines a connection to VIC– while they optimize a lower bound, our work optimizes a sandwich bound on the empowerment1.
 The resulting classifier trained with those samples improves the OOD detection results.
 The consistent superior performance of our method demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in estimating Bayesian uncertainty in the dynamic model for efficient exploration.

 For large-scale and high-dimensional data, Li et al., (2016a) also proposed the asynchronous parallel variant of SVRG-HT (called ASVRG-HT) by utilizing multicore architectures.
 Existing FL works usually focus on objectives (2) and (3), and take the personalized performance as secondary.
 With these two functions, we first measure the difference between the real text and the generated text by a MLE-trained language model (pretrain).
The main contributions include:
 This leads to a potential undesirable effect of imbalanced training between the hallucinator and the learner: the learner tends to be stronger and makes allowances for errors in the hallucination, whereas the hallucinator becomes “lazy” and does not make its best effort to capture the data distributions, which is empirically observed in our experiments (See Figure 3).
 Inspired by the celebrated survey propagation (Braunstein et al., 2005) for solving the SAT problem, AutoDP could be interpreted as prioritizing the “easier” decisions to be made first, which in turn simplifies the harder ones by eliminating the source of uncertainties.
 With random and adversarial rotations, RST improves standard accuracy by∼1% and robust accuracy by 1−3%.
 In the following, we first describe the details of our method (Section 2) and briefly review related works (Section 3).
 We leave these for future work to explore.
 The core idea underlying preference MORL is to modify the Pareto dominance relationship, so as to enhance the selection pressure of the algorithms and guide the algorithm to converge quickly to the preference region.
 In addition, we show that optimizing the BC-loss would not change the optimal solution of the original GAN, but it reduces the feasible set to ensure the model compatibility.
 In CQ, we can sparsify almost large weights toward ternary weights.
 Our results show that causal learning approaches are a promising direction for training models on sensitive data.
The other category is based on sparsified gradient, which is called sparse communication.
 In this model, inputs are thus structured and labels depend on their lower-dimensional latent representation.
 We find that the test accuracy of a 16-4 Wide-ResNet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) trained on CIFAR-10 for 9725 updates falls from 94.7% at a batch size of 4096 to 92.8% at a batch size of 16384.
 As the variance of the random noise grows, we find that the optimal designs award larger second prizes, acting to protect bidders against the effect of the noise.
In summary, our contributions are as follows.
DeepXML: DeepXML improved both accuracy and scalability over existing deep extreme classifiers by partitioning all L labels into a small set of head labels, with cardinality less than 0.
The regular algorithms presented in this section would fail to detect such kind of change points.
 (Hénaff et al., 2019) also show that these representations could be used for downstream tasks such as semi-supervised image classification in the low-data regime going on to record impressive results in the 1% and 10% ImageNet classification.
 However, in many situations, either the domain of anomalous samples cannot be fully understood or modelled, or the domain of the normal samples is too complicated to be modelled in one class.
 While the most recent studies (related over-parameterized DNNs) consider fully-connected networks applied on classification problems (Neyshabur et al., 2019), our approach focuses on deep-unfolding architectures and opts to understand how the networks learn a low-complexity representation for sequential signal reconstruction, which is a regression problem across time.
 However, the factors considered in the expansion of metro line vary with different cities and stages.
 Recently, StarGAN-VC (proposed by Kameoka et al., (2018)) is a state-of-the-art method among all the GAN-based frameworks for non-parallel many-to-many VC.

 Most notably the work of (Litany et al., 2017) who combined functional maps with joint diagonalization to solve partial shape matching problems, and the product manifold filter (PMF) (Vestner et al., 2017b;a) and zoomout (Melzi et al., 2019) – two greedy algorithms for correspondence refinement by gradual introduction of high frequencies.
 In particular, this paper makes the following contributions:
 Each possible displacement is represented by a matrix that acts on the vector.
Analogous architectures have been proposed in the world of graphical models and causal models.
 While the empirical performance of QSGDinf is strong, their theoretical guarantees on the number of bits transmitted no longer apply.
 With the use of such templates, class membership of individual samples can then easily be determined by computing the similarity between the representation of an individual sample and all template representations.
 The “OT” part of the name comes from Optimal Transport.
 We conduct extensive experiments, on multiple image enhancement/restoration (super-resolution, denoising, and JPEG-deblocking) and recognition (classification and detection) tasks, and demonstrate that our approaches can substantially boost the recognition accuracy on the downstream systems, with minimal or no loss in the image processing quality measured by conventional metrics.

 Our results also show that neural network training techniques such as regularization, can be as important as high-level reinforcement learning algorithms in terms of boosting performance.
We also prototype our algorithms for the task of interactive annotation.
 Automatic problem generation has been applied to train program synthesis systems (Balog et al., 2016; Christakopoulou & Kalai, 2018) and in numerous related domains such as mathematical problems (Saxton et al., 2019) and IQ tests (Barrett et al., 2018).
We summarize our contributions as follows.
 In Section 4, we provide more discussion on the related works.
 In conclusion, our contributions are listed below:
 Even for the same loss function, different such assumptions lead to different dynamics in GANs.
To summarize our contributions:
 However this task in general does not satisfy all assumptions in Bora et al., (2018), which results in ambiguities in the training.
 However, we are not aware of a technical discussion in the literature of the obvious existential question: Is the architecture of the brain susceptible to evolution through natural selection? Can brain circuits evolve? Our mathematical and empirical results in this paper on NNE strongly suggest that, indeed, effective brain circuits specializing in classification tasks could have evolved.
Our contributions are highlighted as follows:
 Under noisy labels, the analysis suggests SGD only outperforms SVRG under a mild total computational cost.
 The proposed latent model is learned only from multi-step reward prediction.
 The same principle is also harnessed to reformulate VAE.
 We highlight the benefits of using these methods for large batch settings.
 The network’s prediction is likely to be consistent on clean samples and inconsistent or oscillates strongly on wrongly labeled samples over different training iterations.
 If the network is equipped with a continuous loss function (e.g, cross-entropy), we argue that the training process will make a great “meaningless effort” to enforce some network output digits of the final matching matrix into binary and neglect the resting digits which might have notable impact on accuracy.
 Compared with state-of-the-art methods, it leads to significant improvements of 14.4%, 18.2%, 13.4%, 16.4% mAP on Market-to-Duke, Duke-to-Market, Market-to-MSMT, Duke-to-MSMT re-ID tasks.

 Compared with expanding RNN hidden states, the newly added memory slots cause less contamination of the existing knowledge in RNN states, as will be shown by a theorem.
 To sum up, the contribution of this paper is three-fold:
 The first is an attention generator, which translates distributional signatures into attention scores that reflect word importance for classification.
Our paper makes three contributions.
 In novelty detection, combining both the DSGAN and variational auto-encoder (VAE, Kingma & Welling (2014b)) methods achieve the state-of-the-art results.
 We establish a convergence rate in the order of O(1/ ), which is faster than that achieved by simply applying the result in (Rafique et al., 2018) to the considered problem under the PL condition, i.g,, O(1/ 3) and O(n/ ) with n being the size of training set.
 This makes our algorithm more practical in real scenarios.
 Although it also produces structural perturbations, these perturbations are usually not suitable for attacking regular networks and sometimes its performance is even worse than directly applying NES to the images (Cheng et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2019).
However, the results of Delayed Q-learning still leave a quadratic gap in 1/ from the best-known lower bound.
 Section 2 briefly reviews multiscale scattering transforms.
 Finally, our construction is very fast; it took about 56 sec. to compress each dense layer in the VGG-16 network using the platform specified in the experimental section.
 Specifically, the local minima of the empirical risk R̂ with respect to the parameter W are also the local minima with respect to the variable Ŵ .
To this end, we propose a novel network architecture, named Action Semantics Network (ASN) to characterize such action semantics for more efficient multiagent coordination.
In the tabular domain, we base OPIQ on UCB-H (Jin et al., 2018), a simple online Q-learning algorithm that uses count-based intrinsic rewards and optimistic initialisation.

 For large and high-dimensional imitation learning problems, we often encounter infinitely many states.
 In other words, instead of finding all features that should be activated by feature extractor, we assign very large value to only one neuron to compensate for other neurons that we do not activate.
 Our main contribution here is within the network level.
We conduct experiments on three canonical and publicly available datasets: coloured Multi-dSprites (Burgess et al., 2019), the GQN dataset (Eslami et al., 2018), and ShapeStacks (Groth et al., 2018).
 Theoretical arguments are provided on how perturbations introduced by sampling basis elements can propagate to the appearance of generated images.
1 Another approach involves learning adversarial examples for one model (with access to its gradient information) to transfer them against another (Liu et al., 2016; Papernot et al., 2017).
 Eventually, as the former goes to zero, the latter vanishes as well, suggesting that the optimization has reached a critical point, if not a local minimum1.
 In Section 4 we derive a continuous relaxation that can be used as a regularizer, and optimized using gradient descent.
 We extend our tools to give generalization bounds for adversarially robust classification error which are analogous to our bounds in the standard setting.
 Further, we show a straightforward extension for obtaining a group DP version of our setting to protect multiple samples simultaneously.
In this paper, we refer to the above embedding-based model as the two-tower retrieval model, because the query and document embeddings are coming from two separate “towers” of neural networks.
 However, they trained for ‘only’ 5 million steps of experience.
 In order to solve the costly bilevel optimization in T-NAS, we propose an efficient first-order approximation algorithm to update meta-architecture and meta-weights together.
 This property is akin to the nearest neighbors algorithm (see, e.g, Papernot & McDaniel (2018)).
The relationship between strong gradients and generalization can also be understood through the lens of algorithmic stability (Bousquet & Elisseeff, 2002): strong gradient directions are more stable since the presence or absence of a single example does not impact them as much, as opposed to weak gradient directions which may altogether disappear if a specific example is missing from the training set.
 In this model, the content retrieved from memory is recirculated back as the new query, then the difference between the content retrieved at different time steps in the re-circulation process is used to calculate if the network has settled into a fixed point, and if so this process terminates.
 For example, a good DST model should detect the relation that train departure should not have the same value as train destination (example in Table 1).
 We propose to discretize Eq. 3 to realize iRNN (see Sec.3).
 However, we observed directly using moving average statistics as substitutes for batch statistics can’t make training converge in practice.
 Compared with previous convergence results for training deep linear networks from Du & Hu (2019), our condition on the neural network width is independent of the neural network depth L, and is strictly better by a factor of OpLκq.
 Compared with the multinomial distribution used in Liang et al., (2018), this leads to not only a smoother intensity over space but also better predictions in terms of ranking-based losses.
 We refer to this method as UCB-P.
 Such a tighter upper bound of the 0-1 loss can reduce the influence of the noisy outliers compared with conventional (convex) losses.
 Our analysis answers two questions:Q1.
 In the following, we use ∆(X ) to denote the set of distributions over a setX .
The effectiveness of these two regularization methods is verified empirically – on MNIST and CIFAR-10, they are able to achieve highly nontrivial test accuracy, on a par with or even better than early stopping.
 The more general setting of maximizing a convex function over any compact set also has been studied by Journée et al., (2010) in the context of sparse PCA, which has provided convergence guarantees for this class of programs.
 Furthermore, there are typically multiple residents in the home, making it hard to tell which of them interacted with the appliance.
 These models also have expressive power similar as the linear NTK, and potentially even better generalization and sample complexity (Section 6 & Appendix D).
 The experiments showed DNCRF converged to comparable results produced by its tabular counterpart while performing much better than NFSP.
 For example, in layout synthesis an autoencoder can be trained over a large number of views and their positions extracted from running real-world applications.

 In scenario 1), comparing local SGD with H 4 (A4) with mini-batch SGD of same effective batch size B 4Bloc (A3) reveals a stark difference, both in terms of train and test error (local SGD achieves lower training loss and higher test accuracy).
 Next, we expand our analysis to the case of approximate solutions for the extended CycleGAN loss by proving perturbation bounds in Proposition 2.3 and Corollary 2.1.
We follow the static compiler approach of constructing a coarse static cost model to evaluate execution decisions and optimizing them with respect to it, as done in (Addanki et al., 2018; Jia et al., 2018).
 A straight-forward modification of our method also tackles point-goal navigation tasks, and won the AI Habitat challenge at CVPR2019 across all tracks.
 Wu & Dredze (2019) and Pires et al., (2019) identified the cross-lingual success of the model and tried to understand it.
 The tasks are designed to be difficult challenges in our targeted setting, and several state of the art methods (themselves ablations of our approach) fail to solve them.
 To perform amortized variational inference, we propose a parameterization for the variational posterior based on synthetic gradient descent, which incoporates the contextual information from all the inputs of the query set.
 Optimizing over the latent codes at test time (without class supervision which exists at training time), leads to overfitting which results in entangled representations.
 By further incorporating additional modules, our method achieves 77.6% top-1 accuracy.
 As supported by the theoretical findings in McAllester & Statos (2018), any distribution-free high-confidence lower bound on entropy requires a sample size exponential in the size of the bound.
 We first show that our approach can achieve similar or better results on the standard imitation learning setting, which assumes the same dynamics between the expert and the imitator.
 Our semantic adversarial attacks provide further insights about the vulnerabilities of ML models and therefore encourage new solutions to improve their robustness.
The contributions of this work are:
 A conventional rotation equivariant network is required to perform inference and learning on the set of all possible orientations of the visual patterns constituting a face regardless of the input orientation (fig. 2b).
 The other parametrizations have the problem of yielding gradients with an unbounded gradient norm and coupled components.
 It can be efficiently pre-trained and included into our approach, and requires only minimal tuning.
 The patterns themselves are drawn from randomly initialized (and therefore untrained) neural networks.
 This is motivated from the Hebb’s principle which states that the plasticity of a synapse is dependent on the spiking activity of the neurons connected to the synapse.
 Additionally, without the restriction of searching only the proximity of the initial position, the weights in the target model can be optimized freely and thus increasing their generalization capacity.
 The student model is trained on the labeled data using a supervised objective function while the teacher model is trained on unlabeled data with InfoGraph.
 Then we combine it with a parallel architecture of Residual Deep Convolutional Networks (He et al., (2015)) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks (Cho et al., (2014)) to provide strong estimation results.
However, as environments increase in scale and multi-agent autocurricula become more open-ended, evaluating progress by qualitative observation will become intractable.
Empirically, our pre-training strategy used together with the most expressive GNN architecture, GIN (Xu et al., 2019), yields state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets and avoids negative transfer across downstream tasks we tested.
 However, we seek to design algorithms that better capture rule-specific noise with the help of exemplars around which we have supervision that the rule fired correctly.
 Unlike the existing researches, our bound is valid to evaluate the original network before compression, and thus gives a direct explanation about why deep learning generalizes despite its large network size.
 On one hand, relevant messages from distant nodes are mixed indistinguishably with a large number of irrelevant messages from proximal nodes in multi-layer MPNNs, which implies that the relevant information will be “washed out” and cannot be extracted effectively.
In order to exploit the inherent structure of the problem and the data, we propose a novel machine learning framework for designing a branching strategy.
 ME naturally seeks solutions that balance low rank and a small reconstruction error (cf. Section 3.1).
 Thus, inductive biases need to be encoded into the network architecture.
 We propose to use a similar mechanism for automated discovery of patterns by unsupervised learning of a low-dimensional representation of features of self-organized patterns.
To summarize our contributions:
 We focus on two of these that we consider as fundamental to building better capsule network models.
 Moreover, the biased gradient bring more difficulty in proving the convergence, which are greatly different from those encountered in (Lei & Jordan, 2017; Lian et al., 2017; Lei et al., 2017).
 Therefore, when emphasis focus changes, the emphasis spread should be adjusted accordingly.
To verify the hypothesis and explore the effects of differently wired topologies, toy experiments on CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) are conducted.
 This enables the attacker g to learn potential common structures of the perturbations.
 During the process, the neural network captures the mutual information among different parts of the image.
 Lastly, we show how to extend such a result to deeper networks through blockwise bound propagation leading to several orders of magnitude tighter bounds as compared to IBP.
In order to directly compare and have a better understanding of the different selectivity measures we assessed (1) localist, (2) precision, and (3) CCMAS selectivity of the conv5, fc6, and fc7 of AlexNet trained on ImageNet, and in addition, we employed a range of signal detection methods on these units, namely, (4) recall with 100% and 95% precision, (5) maximum informedness, (6) specificity at maximum informedness , and (7) recall (also called sensitivity) at maximum informedness, and false alarm rates at maximum informedness (described in Sec.2).
Together with improving the performance and enhancing the convergence rate of SNNs, the goal that whether a method that can absorb both advantages of ANNs and SNNs can be achieved.
 Further, we present a more careful analysis that leads to improved over-parameterization bounds as compared with 15.
 In this work, we show that directly optimising the proposal distribution, e.g, as done by RWS, is preferable to optimising the IWAE multi-sample objective because (a) the multi-sample objective typically relies on reparametrisations and, even if these are available, leads to the φ-gradient breakdown, (b) modifications of the IWAE φ-gradient which avoid this breakdown (i.g, IWAE-STL and IWAE-DREG) can be justified in a more principled manner by taking an RWS-type adaptive importance-sampling view.
In summary, our contributions are 2-fold.
 Our contributions include:
 We give a set of recommendations regarding applying new models that work with graph structured data.
 Our explanation is supported by carefully-designed experiments and provides a new perspective on analyzing learning rate decay.
 However, our analysis shows that our algorithm can sustain long training without overfitting the noise which makes the proposed algorithm more user-friendly.
 There are no easy fixes of the two issues, because all these designs in AIGP serve the purpose of decomposition.
 However, they only consider the deterministic system dynamics and do not analyze the filtering relationship between two stochastic processes.
 Moreover, AutoGrow can also discover shallower DNNs when the dataset is a subset.
 Increasing this tolerance enhances the precision of the solution but results in more iterations by the solver, which leads to higher NFEs and longer training time.
 By applying `p,q weight normalization, we obtain a tighter bound.
 Therefore, interpretabilty does not come at a cost anymore.
 Our model uses words, characters, and labels as inputs.
 Section 5 and 6 provide the new algorithm and some experimental results.
 Next, in Section 3 we describe the model and the algorithm.
 Our key contributions are four fold:
 This is similar to Newton’s method, but applied only in the descent direction (section 2).
 For example, the inference time and memory required in retrieval tasks increases linearly with the embedding size.
 In dialog response generation task, Parallel Scheduled Sampling achieves 1.6 BLEU score (11.5%) improvement over teacher-forcing while in image generation it achieves 20% and 13.8% improvement in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) respectively.
 We hope to promote work in this still nascent field which has yet to see the same level of success as the generation of smaller molecules.
The main contributions of this work are as follows:
 We compare our NAS algorithm against a host of black-box optimization NAS algorithms including regularized evolution, reinforcement learning, Bayesian optimization with a GP model, AlphaX (Wang et al., 2018), ASHA (Li & Talwalkar, 2019), DARTS (Liu et al., 2018b), and TPE (Bergstra et al., 2011).
We argue that a naive implementation of a graphical model as shown in Figure 2 (left), e.g, by a conditional GAN (Mirza & Osindero, 2014), does not satisfy Criterion 2.
 We also demonstrate the generated sequences are useful as subgoals for actual physical execution in the animated world.
 The ASPP module uses the dilated convolution to increase the receptive field size without increasing the number of parameters.
 Although a similar statistical test based on MMD via a graph kernel was used for schema matching of protein graphs in Kriegel et al., (2006), to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to use as an evaluation metric for graph generation tasks.
In the proposed scenario, where we are trying to characterize the uncertainty of a black-box nonmutable model, many of the state-of-the-art techniques are not applicable.
 In our model, we do not use convolution explicitly but just do linear transform and non-linear activation for “filter-domain” (i.g,, horizontal axis of tensors in fig. 1).
 The convergence analysis was given for convex problems (Yin et al., 2008; Cai et al., 2009), yet remaining open for non-convex problems met in deep learning.
Contributions.
 We derive a theoretical guarantee of the invertibility of the GRF and introduce constraints on the GRF parameters, based on rigorous mathematical calculations.
 Moreover, standard benchmarks often strongly influence the evolution of NLU models, which means they should be as exhaustive as possible, and closely related to the models’ end use cases.
This structural similarity across the state-of-the-art algorithms has attracted our attention.
 Note that, under the second meaning, xS = x − xS .
 Since the discriminator is trained to distinguish the difference between the networks’ feature map distributions (containing the history of feature maps for different input images) at every training iteration, by fooling the discriminator, the network learns the co-trained network’s changing feature map distribution.
 We incorporate feature distribution and label distribution alignment into an end-to-end deep learning framework, as illustrated in Figure 1.
We want to emphasize that the deep learning based estimators considered above are able to handle complex data.
 In a similar fashion, we define calibration for regression by simply replacing the misclassification probability with the mean square error.
 We also develop a hierarchical discriminator which breaks down the job of the discriminator into determining the factual treatment and determining the factual dosage using separate networks.
 The improvements are 8% and 51% on two real-world datasets.
 To sum up, the proposed SR method can effectively deal with the real distortions and restore fine details.
Experiments are provided on various datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, Penn Treebank (PTB), and networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Residual architecture (ResNet) (He et al., 2016), Wide Residual architecture (Wide ResNet) (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016), Non-Residual architecture (VGG-16) (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory architecture (LSTM) (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997), Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2015), and the recent Noise Conditional Score Network (NCSN) (Song & Ermon, 2019).
 When compared to the embedding of the proposed Laplacian denoising autoencoder (LapDAE), we can observe that different categories (digits) are well discriminated from each other and with much less noise.
 Section 3 provides some qualitative insights about the difference in distribution between logit and softmax values on MNIST.
 Inspired by the usage of structural coverage in conventional software testing, we use neuron coverage of a DL model to measure its testing adequacy in this work.
 It generates diverse images with high realism on par with existing approaces, while adding some noteworthy and useful properties.
 Our contributions are mainly from the following aspects:
 The lead bias is introduced by the journalistic convention of writing using an inverted pyramid structure, placing the most important information in the beginning of an article.
 The latter requires no upfront knowledge of open set data or corresponding modifications to loss or training procedure and can successfully prevent nonsensical predictions for unseen unknown data, a robustness feature that is currently not present in closed world continual learning systems.
We now begin our exposition by reviewing the continual learning setup.
 We also develop a stochastic version of our algorithm.
 We define a suitable notion, leading to an upper bound for the generalization error given by feature robustness together with representativeness.
The pipeline consists of two phases.
 More formally, a bag is a function B : X → N where X is the space of instances.
 The effectiveness of UDA across different training data sizes are highlighted in Figure 4 and 5.
 Our approach, however, is based on bounding the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of deep neural networks.
In addition, the main source of overhead in NAS is evaluation of sampled architectures.
 Efforts have also been made in exploring accelerated learning directly on real robots, through Guided Policy Search (GPS) (Levine et al., 2015) and parallelizing the training across multiple agents using meta-learning (Levine et al., 2016; Nagabandi et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2018).
Organization.
 On the contrary, we find that real-world noise is more difficult for robust DNNs to improve.
 While both HSimplE and HypE outperform our baselines and the state-of-the-art, HypE is more effective with fewer parameters.
 This is a critical advantage of our method as it would otherwise be computationally infeasible to generate high quality trajectories using tree search.
 Similar to past work, our model can be viewed as a mixture of a NER module and a RE module (Figure 1).
 A key challenge lies in defining a suitable search space; we propose one that is considerably larger than the one used in DARTS or ENAS, allowing us to (putatively) search over a more diverse set of candidate architectures.
The most relevant work to ours is (Chen et al., 2019), which robustified network interpretation with the aid of integrated gradient (IG), an axiomatic attribution map.
 Score-based and decision-based attacks need a lot of queries to generate each adversarial attack.
 The whole training process includes two separate functional components: missing detail recuperative part (JPG recovering stage) and SR mapping learning part (SR generating stage).
 At test time, a diverse collection of reactions is then obtained by collecting together predictions resulting from conditioning on each latent class.
 By dividing up the space into four slices si and sending s1, s3 to the first generator and s2, s4 to the second generator, we can generate four disconnected manifolds with just two generators.
 These results clearly indicate the potential of our new method for solving the TSP.
 Using our Way Off-Policy algorithm, we are able to effectively learn from this batch of data, in spite of the fact that it was generated with a vastly different set of model architectures, which were trained on different datasets.
Taking the advantages from these two ways, we put forward a system with a higher level of generalization capability upon previous work (especially, Bacon et al., (2017) and Kulkarni et al., (2016)) and present a novel framework dubbed as ROS-HPL: Robotic Object Search with Hierarchical Policy Learning and Intrinsic-Extrinsic Modeling, to mitigate the aforementioned challenges (see fig.  1 left).
 An individual’s value structure imposes a framework for determining significance of events (Peterson, 1999).
We finetune CuBERT on each of the classification tasks and compare the results with multi-layered bidirectional LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) models.
 Once a network has been trained for a fixed number of epochs with this setup, an additional set of ground-truth labels is introduced to the network and the training process continues.
 To fill the gap between sub-actions, we adopt the CQL model as follows.
 Experiment results demonstrate that our model outperforms the stateof-the-art models by large margins.
 With the predictions from the regressors, we will be able to apply the idea of BTS to decide on whether to adopt the minority as the answer via comparing the prior (computed using the regressor) and the posterior for each label.
 Archetypal analysis does not assume a parametric model and can learn a wide class of topic models.
 For instance, consider two elements x1 and x2 with τ > s(x1) s(x2).
We highlight our contributions as follows:
 As a result, the CE-ResNet50 and CE-MobileNet V2 outperform their counterparts by 1.7% and 2.1% top-1 accuracy with nearly the same FLOPs.
 In the 2d case, the dynamics are piecewise nonlinear, and we show that our method infers much better segmentation than previous approaches for comparable computational cost.
 Thus, most of the current state-of-the-art systems are much more complicated to fine-tune for different NLP problems and data-sets.
 Our algorithm is very different from Yogi, AdamW and AdaBound.
 This new upper bound enables the weak depth-dependent argument of learning ResNet.
 On the basis of these insights, we introduce an auxiliary instance driven detection objective Ammirato et al., (2018) that improves tracking performance over our baseline.
 Existing one-shot approaches (Brock et al., 2017; Bender et al., 2018) still have coupled weights in the supernet.
 We show that such a simplifications will not sacrifice the explainability too much with an ablation study.
 A further advantage to this unification is that it opens a wide design space for connecting our memory networks to each other, as well as standard neural network architectures.
 Training a single model for multiple scales is difficult for the previous CSC based image SR method (Gu et al., 2015).
 Wistuba et al., (2016); Feurer et al., (2018) proposed to transfer surrogate model by linear combination of surrogate models of problems in meta train set with coefficients determined by ranking of function values or meta features.
 Due to its efficient spatial partitioning strategy, it can simulate millions of particles on a single GPU.
 We use a two-layers MLP as the classifier; and 2.
 Our framework is able to achieve the optimal width-resolution balance under certain resource constraint.
 Synthetic data evaluation is a notoriously difficult problem marked by the lack of universally agreed-upon quality measures (Theis et al., 2015).
 Additionally, finely controllable image generation can be enabled by specifying the desired image via a collection of logical clauses, with applications to neural scene rendering (Eslami et al., 2018).
 This corresponds to the important observation that outlier will be mapped far from the mean of the data.
• Inspired by our theoretical findings, we provide an adversarial robust training algorithm using both labeled and unlabeled data.
 The model is updated by stochastic gradient descent with stochastic gradients computed based on the sampled pairs according to the found optimal distributional variable.
 These dimensions are inside convolution window R ×S and across input/output feature matrix (C K ).
A second line of work studies network similarity.
 In summary,our contributions include the following.
 To summarize our contributions,
 This forms the second key contribution of our paper.
 We summarize its key advantages as follows:
 Although it makes each processor to evaluate a stochastic gradient update on a global parameter stored in a shared memory in an asynchronous and lock-free mode, ASVRG-HT attains the similar gradient and hard thresholding complexities as its general version (i.g,, SVRG-HT).
 This is largely due to the fact that it was not obvious that getting a solid initial model is feasible or practical if devices are available occasionally and with limited resources.
 Each strict local minima corresponds to a modecollapse situation.
 Second, we try some methods to update generator with feedback signal from D, then, we use these metric functions to evaluate the updated generator.
 To address this issue, our key insight is to enforce direct and early supervision for the hallucinator, and make its contribution to the overall classification transparent, as shown in Figure 1b.
 Compared to the greedy strategy (Khalil et al., 2017) which determines the membership of a single vertex at each step, our framework brings significant speedup by allowing determinations on as many vertices as possible to happen at once.
 Then, we give some experimental results (Section 4) and conclude the paper (Section 5).
 Consequently, we propose a new measurement to estimate the agent’s performance, which is called Trajectory Preference Domination.
 The low entropy of the centralized distribution improves the compression rate of encoding.
 Section 2 describes the properties of causal models.
 In sparse communication, after calculating the update vector gt,k at each iteration, each worker only sends a subset of coordinates in gt,k, denoted as S(gt,k), to the server or other workers.
 We experimentally demonstrate that training networks on data sets drawn from this model reproduces both behaviours observed when training on MNIST.
 When performing language modelling with an LSTM on the Penn TreeBank dataset for 16560 updates (Zaremba et al., 2014), the test perplexity rises from 81.7 to 92.2 when the batch size rises from 64 to 256.
1L, containing the most frequently occuring labels and a large set of tail labels containing everything else.
 Indeed: (a) Existing parametric models for CPD compare the distribution between two windows by looking at some statistics.
While such impressive results have been shown using the contrastive methods, methods of such quality for generative approaches are ye to be shown on images.
 DGMs are more suitable than supervised methods in such cases.
 Furthermore, while there have been efforts to build deep RNNs (Pascanu et al., 2014; Li et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2017; Wisdom et al., 2017), examining the generalization property of such deep RNN models on unseen sequential data still remains elusive.
 Once the objectives of metro expansion change, heuristic methods need to be revised.
 AdaGAN is also GAN-based framework.
It is worth noting that although we consider convolutional neural networks for image classification, this method could be applied for any neural network model architectures and applications.
 This last method lent its name to the loss we define in Section 3.
 When the image changes according to the displacements, the vector at each pixel is multiplied by the matrix that represents the local displacement, in other words, the vector at each pixel is rotated by the matrix representation of the displacement of this pixel.
 Indeed, to write down such a model is to explicitly allow specific direct interactions and forbid the rest.
 Indeed, in our own empirical evaluation of QSGD, we find the variance induced by quantization is substantial, and the performance is far from that of SGD and QSGDinf.
Together these results provide a complete, analytically tractable, and dataset-independent theory for learning in very deep and wide networks.
 We will show that, for the same neural network, this method performs well on multi-label classification tasks for images, where any image can be assigned several classes (for example, ‘baseball’ and ‘bat’).
 We show that this unsupervised approach produces meaningful coarse graphs that are structure preserving; and that the learned representations perform competitively with supervised approaches in graph classification and regression.
 Compared with vanilla Transformer, Explicit Sparse Transformer demonstrates better performances in the above three tasks.
 Also, the accuracy improvement transfers favorably among different recognition model architectures, object categories, and recognition tasks, which renders our simple solution effective even when we do not have access to the downstream recognition models.
Novelty and significance.
3. For the planner, we base on AlphaZero Monte-Carlo Tree Search (see Silver et al., (2017)), which we enhance with the possibility of exploiting the graph structure of environments and the properties of the optimal solutions.
 However, how to seamlessly unify these two independent models together to capture both the feature interaction and sample interaction is challenging.
 We demonstrate that FICM is preferable to the previous prediction-based exploration methods in terms of exploration efficiency of the agent in several tasks and environments, especially for those featuring sophisticated moving patterns.
 The SCAN model leverages image region-by-word interactions to learn better representations for image-text matching.
 Linear SVM with binary pseudo labeling is used to find the discriminative hyperplane and the even split ensures the decision tree to be balanced.
 Even though POPQORN cannot directly verify audio classifiers, their approximations for LSTM non-linearities can be integrated in DAC.
 Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:
 Based on initial scribbles and a baseline DCNN’s probability map, our algorithms acheive 90.9% mIoU on VOC validation set, with just 3 rounds (1 scribbles per image each round) of correction scribbles.
 However, these problems were generated non-adaptively, often via random sampling.
The main contributions are:
 Rather than trying to define a suitable solution concept based on, for instance, the spectrum of the Hessian, it might be more fruitful to directly model the behavior of the two players.
 We resolve these issues in our paper by using suitable priors.
 The network is computationally efficient architecture and is constructed by selecting the optimal number of filters in each layer of the network.
We also propose a second biologically plausible ANN-like mechanism, based on dopaminergic plasticity.
 However, SGD always exhibits a faster convergence compared to SVRG when there is no label noise.
 Here, the neighboring area is defined by the states which share the same cluster with the current state.
 We conducted an extensive set of experiments to verify the effectiveness of BSL.
 Optimizing exclusively for reward prediction allows us to circumvent the inefficiency stemming from learning irrelevant parts of the state space, while maintaining the model-based sample efficiency.
 The spherical normalization is simply put on latent variables instead of variational inference while preserving randomness of latent variables by centerization.
 Based on this observation, we record the outputs of a single network made on different training epochs and treat them as an ensemble of predictions obtained from different individual networks.
 To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the Graph2Seq architecture for QG.
This paper strikes an endeavor on the above two gaps and makes the following main contributions:
 We empirically verify our claims on several benchmarks.
 It turns out momentum plays a central role in the convergence analysis.
 Intuitively, the graph curvature measures how well two neighborhoods are connected and/or overlap with each other.
 A key problem of such line of works is that the computation is not differentiable, making it difficult to be used in deep learning frameworks.
 One is “BN folded training”(Krishnamoorthi, 2018), which adopts BN fusion before weights quantization in every training step; the other is to use symmetric linear quantization.
 The UCC model accepts any bag of instances as input and uses ucc labels for supervised training.
 In recent years, there have been many studies using deep learning and RL to solve combinatorial optimization problems (Smith, 1999; Mao et al., 2016; Lodi & Zarpellon, 2017; Veličković et al., 2017; Lombardi & Milano, 2018; Bengio et al., 2018).
 Hence, it is an advantage that our defense method is attack-agnostic.
 We also introduce weight normalization for neural network quantization.
 The level of fuzziness in knowledge consistency measures the difficulty of transforming features of a DNN to features of another DNN.
 In Section 4, we present numerical experiments, highlighting the topics of exploration (Section 4.1), the utility of compact architectures (Section 4.2), the stability of deterministic policies (Section 4.3), and comparisons against existing MAML algorithms in the few-shot regime (Section 4.4).
 He proposed to use two recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to encode two types of state: unconscious state represented by a high-dimensional vector before attention and conscious state by a derived low-dimensional vector after attention.
 Note that Shimada et al., (2019) also propose to mixup the input points in the test phase, but they do not consider their method from the aspect of adversarial robustness.
 Behind the simple formula, the MMC loss elegantly combines the favorable merits of the previous methods, which leads to a considerable improvement on the adversarial robustness.
 The respective graphical model is illustrated in Figure 3.
 Compared with standard adversarial training (dashed blue line), the final robustness drops drastically, if examples in subset S− are not perturbed (solid green line) during adversarial training (other examples are still perturbed by PGD10).
 The convergence speed per iteration s(m), as well as the optimal hyper-parameters, increase linearly as m in the linear scaling regime, sub-linearly in the diminishing returns regime, and can only increase by a small constant factor in the saturation regime.
 Informed by the attention generator’s output, our second component, a ridge regressor, quickly learns to make predictions after seeing only a few training examples.
 Alternatively, one can obtain an ( , √ ) second order stationary point in T = O((1 − β) log(1/(1 − β) ) −5) iterations.
 TREMBA, on the other hand, tries to learn an embedding space that can efficiently generate adversarial perturbations for a pretrained source network.
 This is partly because the updates in Q-value are made in an over-conservative way.
 Section 3 introduces homotopy dictionary learning for classification, with a proof of exponential convergence under appropriate assumptions.
Our Contributions:
 We thereby prove this property by combining the convexity and the correspondence of the minima.
 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:
 Instead of optimistically initialising the Q-values, we pessimistically initialise them and use Q+-values during action selection and bootstrapping.
 No new hyperparameters are introduced using the GA method.
To summarize, the contributions of our paper are three-fold:

 The latter two are simulated 3D environments which serve as testing grounds for navigation and object manipulation tasks, respectively.
The proposed BasisGAN introduces a generalizable concept to promote diverse modes in the conditional image generation.
 Alternately, Xiao et al., (2018) use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate adversarial examples which are based on small norm-bounded perturbations.
 We call this phenomenon budgeted convergence and we find it generalizes across budgets.
 We also provide some analytical justifications for our relaxation.
 In Section 4, we provide a natural extension of our all-layer margin to adversarially robust classification.
 In the literature, it is also known as the Siamese network (Das et al., 2016; Triantafillou et al., 2017) or dual-encoder model (Cer et al., 2018; Mazaré et al., 2018).
 It learned near-perfect driving through dynamic and static CARLA environments from expert observations alone.
 Savva et al., (2019) then scaled this training to 75 million steps and found that this trend reverses – learningbased outperforms classical, even in unseen environments! However, even with an order of magnitude more experience (75M vs 5M), they found that learning had not yet saturated.
 After the whole model is optimized, given a new task, we can get the network architecture structure suitable for the specific task with a few gradient steps from meta-architecture and meta-weights.
 Meanwhile, the elasticity part implies that the prediction surface islikely to remain smooth in the training process, in effect regularizing the complexity of the nets in a certain sense.
 With this observation, we can reason inductively about the stability of GD: since the initial values of the parameters do not depend on the training data, the initial function mapping examples to their gradients is stable.
To implement this principle in a neural network, we were inspired by techniques such as adaptive computation time (Graves, 2016).
 Other cases include time-related pairs such as (taxi arriveBy, taxi leaveAt) and cross-domain pairs such as (hotel area, attraction area).
 At time m, it takes the previous state hm−1 ∈ RD and input xm ∈ Rd and outputs hm ∈ RD after simulating the CTRNN evolution in discrete-time, for a suitable number of discrete steps.
 We think the failure takes place due to the occasional large gradients during training, which has been mentioned in Ioffe (2017).
 Compared to a univariate model, such as the trans-Gaussian Cox processes (Williams & Rasmussen, 2006), our multivariate model enhances the predictive ability on missing or unobserved areas, which is consistent with the results of heterogeneous multi-output Gaussian processes (Moreno-Muñoz et al., 2018).

1Complete dictionary learning requires the learned dictionary D in equation 1 to be square and invertible.
Our model is based on cross-modal prediction.
 In addition, we tested DNCFR on extremely large game, heads-up no-limit Texas Hold’em (HUNL).
 However, instead of training such an unsupervised model, in our work we useDU to automatically construct a supervised datasetDS by labelling the samples inDU as positive and generating a set of negative samples by adding suitable noise to the samples in DU .
 Our observation of momentum can be explained as small momentum actually decreases the effective learning rate, which is more suitable for fine-tuning on similar tasks.
Using Rényi correlation coefficient as a regularization term, we propose a min-max optimization framework for fair statistical inference.
 In particular, the generalization bound based on the product of spectral norms of the layers (similar to that of Bartlett et al., (2017)) has very strong negative correlation with generalization.
 On the other hand every polynomial map P satisfying Equation 1 is equivariant.
 This motivates the use of local SGD as an alternative to large-batch training—a hypothesis that we confirm in our experiments.
 We discuss the existence problem of automorphism in Proposition 2.4 and Proposition 2.6.
 This is in contrast to evaluating the cost by executing the computation graph on hardware (Mirhoseiniet al., 2017; 2018).
1Here, the term precision refers to the numerical precision of the models, or the number of bits used to represent their weights and activations.
 The former by considering M-BERT layer-wise, relating cross-lingual performance with the amount of shared word-pieces and the latter by considering the model’s ability to transfer between languages as a function of word order similarity in languages.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach empirically, finding curiosity strategies that perform on par or better than those in published literature.
 We overcome this challenge by introducing a second stage in which we use the class and content codes learned by our model in the first stage for training feed-forward class and content encoders.
 It outperforms MixNet by 0.6% using 363M FLOPs, which is a new state-of-the-art under the mobile scenario.
 More discussions about the bounds of MI and their relationship can be referred to Poole et al., (2019).
 In particular, all functions in the Sobolev space W d+1,1(Rd), i.g,, when all derivatives up to order d + 1 are L1-bounded, have finite representational cost, and this cost can be bounded using the Sobolev norm.
 We then evaluate our approach in the more challenging setting that the dynamics of the expert and the imitator are different.
In summary, our contributions are:
 However, by virtue of its rotation equivariance, it is able to recognize rotated faces even if it is trained on upright faces only.
 While this way of estimating uncertainties was known before (Osband et al., 2019), it did not have a theoretical justification beyond Bayesian linear regression, which is too limiting for modern applications.
 As a result, each term in the decomposition can be treated independently and easily when estimating the Rademacher complexity.
 Therefore, we present attentive feature distillation (AFD) to learn which relevant features to transfer.
Notations: In this paper, unless otherwise clarified, vectors and matrices are denoted by lowercase and uppercase characters, respectively.
 Using InfoGraph*, we achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods on molecular property prediction.
 Our feature-wise transformation layers are method-agnostic and can be applied to various metric-based few-shot classification approaches for improving their generalization to unseen domains.
 As far as the authors know, this is the first documented attempt to predict DoS in warehousing systems.
 This fragment corresponds to graded modal logic (de Rijke, 2000), or, equivalently, to the description logicALCQ, which has received considerable attention in the knowledge representation community (Baader et al., 2003; Baader & Lutz, 2007).
 We therefore propose a suite of targeted intelligence tests to measure capabilities in our environment that we believe our agents may eventually learn, e.g, object permanence (Baillargeon & Carey, 2012), navigation, and construction.
 It significantly improves generalization performanceacross downstream tasks, yielding up to 9.4% higher average ROC-AUC than non-pre-trained GNNs, and up to 5.2% higher average ROC-AUC compared to GNNs with the extensive graph-level multitask supervised pre-training.
 We associate a latent random variable on whether a rule correctly ’covers’ an instance, and jointly learn the distribution among the label and all cover variables.
 The difficulty to apply the compression bound to the original network lies in evaluation of the population L2-bound between the compression network and the original network.
 On the other hand, the representations of different nodes would become very similar in multi-layer MPNNs, and every node’s representation actually carries the information about the entire graph (Xu et al., 2018).
 Our framework is both computationally efficient and effective, giving branching decisions that are of a similar quality to that of strong branching.
 Such a balance on reconstruction error helps to maintain or only slightly degrade the performance for “high-rank” situation.
(iii) One may take a two-step approach, where a post-processing step can be carried out to enforce the constraints whenF\\u03b8 predicts an invalid structure.
 This removes the need for human expert knowledge to define such representations.
 First, most capsule-network models, in their current form, do not scale well to deep architectures.
We integrate emphasis focus and spread into a unified example weighting framework.
 Further, we study their adaptability to learning from fewer examples (Section 5.2) and to changes in the architecture (Section 5.3).
The practical outcome is a simple gradient estimate algorithm that can be plugged in complex stochastic neural networks with multiple layers of Boolean random variables.
 To ensure universality, three types of layer are selected respectively, including 3 × 3 conv, 3 × 3 inverted bottleneck (Sandler et al., 2018) and 3 × 3 separable depthwise conv (Howard et al., 2017).
 Therefore, our method is capable of yielding strong perturbations and accelerating the training process.
 Similarly, in our work, we want to capture the mutual information among different sets of states.
Contributions.
 We also assessed the selectivity of a few units in VGG-16 and GoogLeNet models trained on the ImageNet and Places-365 dataset that were highly selective according to the Network Dissection method (Zhou et al., 2018a).
 To this end, we propose RLIF with both low computational complexity and biological plausibility, to explore its usage in real-world tasks.
In this work we rigorously analyze the dynamics of weight normalization training and its convergence from the perspective of the neural tangent kernel.
 This conclusion was already reached by Le et al., (2019) based on numerical experiments.
The contribution of this paper is two-fold:
In this work, we propose a new GP inference method, Localized and Amortized Inference based on Nearest neighbors (LAIN).
 Around the same time our work was under review, a similar paper was also uploaded in arXiv by Lim et al., (2019), The results in the arXiv paper are similar to the June, 2018 graduation thesis of the first author of the current paper in the use of sufficient statistics, and emphasize on the design and implementation of the algorithm.
 However, when training a neural network, it might not be necessary to achieve high-precision activation, i.g,the solution of the corresponding ODE, at each layer.
 Our experiments demonstrate that GAN models with 2-bit or even 1-bit weights quantized by QGAN can generate samples of comparable quality.
The contributions of this work can be summarized as follow:
 These are proved to be beneficial for text classification in previous works.
 Finally, we give our conclusions and future work.
 Theoretic properties of the algorithm are derived in Section 4.
 Consider the following situation: a subset of the coordinates of the state space can be arbitrarily difficult to express by neural networks, but the reward function can only depend on the rest of the coordinates and remain simple.the test time.
 We do extensive validation that the quadratic is a good approximation here.
Based on these observations, we propose a new way to set the projection size in the attention heads, in which each head has a fixed head size that is independent of both the number of heads and the embedding size of the model.
 In the Appendix, we have provided a clear comparison with 1-D and 2-D representations.
 On the NASBench dataset, our method sees significant improvements compared to all other algorithms we tried across 200 trials.
 In this model, when we condition on x, due to d-separation, c and z could become dependent, unless additional constraints are posed on the model.
Our paper makes three contributions.
 In addition, the convolution layers with different dilation rate can obtain feature maps with multiscale receptive fields.
Our experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs demonstrated that our models can scale up to handle large graphs and datasets that previous methods had difficulty with; our models demonstrated superior results to those of baseline methods.
 For example, some rejectors have to be trained together with the classifier and need access to the internals of the model.
The contributions in this study can be summarized as follow:
 Osher et al., (2016) established statistical model selection consistency for high dimensional linear regression under the same irrepresentable condition as Lasso, later extended to generalized linear models (Huang & Yao, 2018).
 We summarize the contributions:
 Through experiments with most popular graph generation datasets, we observe that a generative model based on the proposed GRF can achieve a generation performance comparable to the GraphNVP Madhawa et al., (2019), but with much fewer trainable parameters.
In this work, we compile a list of 11 discourse-focused tasks that are meant to complement existing benchmarks.
 Through some manipulation, we find that they all employ the same basic rule for estimating individual utilities (see (6) in Section 4 for details).
 The support of x, denoted by supp(x), is the set of indices of the non-zero entries of x, i.g,, supp(x) = {i ∈ {1, . , N} : xi 6= 0}.
 Exchanging the knowledge of feature map distribution facilitates the networks to converge to a better feature map manifold that generalizes better and yields more accurate results.
 Comprehensive experiments on standard crossdomain recognition benchmarks demonstrate that COAL achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on the task of GDA.
 And with our deep learning solution, we are further able to provide estimates for the divergence functions used for our scoring mechanisms with provable finite sample complexity.
 Based on this definition, we propose a new calibration evaluation metric similar to the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) (Naeini et al., 2015), which groups examples into interval bins with similar uncertainty, and then measures the discrepancy between each bin’s parameters and the parameters of the empirical distribution within the bin.
 We show in the experiments section that this approach significantly improves performance and is more stable than using a single network discriminator.
 This includes the PGD-based methods considered in this work, but potentially encompasses a larger class of annealed or adaptive adversarial training algorithms.
The contributions of our work can be summarized into three categories.
 For example, the digit 5 and 3 are better discriminated compared to those from the raw data and from DAE.
 This results in a surprising observation; the method best approximating the Wasserstein distance does not produce the best looking images in the generative setting.
 In Section 4, we show quantitatively the detrimental impact of the softmax on OOD and adversarial detectors performances.
 We use the outputs of the neurons in the last hidden layer of a DL model to represent the output distribution.
 The rest of the manuscript then presents our new algorithm HAL (Section 3), showcases its empirical performance (Section 4), surveys the related literature (Section 5), and offers some concluding remarks (Section 6).
 This version is a similar adaptation of the Bregman method, as Nedić (2011); Polyak (2001); Wang & Bertsekas (2013); Wang et al., (2015) are adaptations of the projected gradient method.
In summary, our contributions are as follows:
In the first phase, Batch RL algorithm is used to extract MDPspecific networks from MDP-specific data.
 Given an instance x ∈ X , B(x) counts the number of occurrences of x in the bag B.
 This indicates that deeper networks are more difficult to train and wider networks improves trainability of neural nets.
 We discuss existing works in more details in Appendix A.
 It is common to define a surrogate operation that can be used in place of training a full model to convergence.
 Sim-to-Real transfers have been widely adopted in the recent works and can be viewed as a subset of same domain transfer problems.
 We design this feature selection to be instance-wise such that the model can decide which features to focus on separately for each input – e.g, for income classification capital gain may be a more important feature to focus on for a middle-aged individual.
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

It is worth stressing how uncompromising that comparison is – in a new environment, an agent navigating without a map traverses a path nearly matching the shortest path on the map.
 Specifically, we split the experiments into two parts: few-shot learning setting and supervised learning setting.
 Since stability (suitably formalized) is equivalent to generalization (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2010), this allows us to see how generalization may degrade as training progresses.
 Like ACT, the network outputs a probability of halting, but unlike ACT, the binary halting random variable is trained using REINFORCE (Williams, 1992).
Our contributions in this work include:
Contributions.
 Moreover, when the global minimum of the training loss is 0, we prove that SGD can further achieve linear rate of global convergence, and the condition on the neural network width does not depend on the target error .
 When the noise rate becomes large, the systematic error (due to label corruption) grows up and becomes not negligible.
 Our conditions relate to the smoothness of GAN loss used as well as the parameterization of the generator.
3We abuse the notation a bit, by denoting ‖·‖44 as the sum of element-wise 4 th power of all entries of a vector and matrix, that is, ∀a ∈ Rn, ‖a‖44 = ∑n i=1 a 4 i and ∀A ∈ Rn×m, ‖A‖44 = ∑ i,j a 4 i,j .
 In contrast, background energy events (e.g, power cycling of the fridge) do not lead to predictable locations.
Our contributions
 Simple weight decay can result in as good performance as the referencebased regularization methods for fine-tuning with better search space.
 All evaluations point toward the ability of PPLMs to generate attribute controlled, fluent text (Section 4).
 We summarize our contributions next:
 The generalization gap can thus not be explained as an optimization issue alone.
 In appendix A, we briefly explain the measure-theoretic language we use heavily in the paper for those readers who are more used to working with distributions, and also remind the reader of some basic notions from differential geometry which we use as well.
 Our cost model corresponds to classical NP-hard scheduling problems, so optimizing it is difficult.
We also note that some of the architectural conclusions have been observed earlier, if not investigated, in other contexts.
 We also quantitatively evaluate the quality of disentanglement of learned features by classifying class labels from content codes and vice versa.
 However, these approximate functions can lead to unstable training and poor performance in optimization due to gradients discrepancy between approximate estimation and true MI.
 Finally, we show that even for imitation across agents of completely different actuators, it is still possible for the state-alignment based method to work.
 Resultantly, the network would risk becoming unable to detect faces in any other orientation than those it is trained on.
 Rarely activated channel neurons can further be removed from the network, reducing the model’s memory footprint.
 While for vectors introduced with subscripts already, e.g, xs, we use (xs)i to denote its i-th element.
 We illustrate how initial results from the ground show appreciable labor savings.
 In summary our contributions in this paper are as follows:Our contributions
 Then, the bound is applied to some typical situations where the network is well compressed.
 In the latent space, complicated topology patterns in graphs can be preserved and presented as intuitive geometry, such as subgraph (Narayanan et al., 2016), community (Ni et al., 2019), and hierarchy (Nickel & Kiela, 2017; 2018).
 (1)Here, G, Γ, pk, and σk are problem-related constants defined in Section 3.1.
 The embedding vectors of the GNN are updated by a novel schedule, which is both computationally cheap and memory efficient.
 The first part of the architecture is a transformer-based deep model called Deep Score Network which represents sequence information useful for structure prediction.
In summary, we provide in this paper the following contributions:
 We argue that this design is not only expensive, but also inefficient.
 The logit vector is the output of the last fully connected (FC) layer of a network.
 It demonstrates an obvious topology-induced impact on optimization.
 Instead of simply computing the high order information with finite difference approximation or multiple gradients, by parameterizing the algorithm as a neural network, our proposed methods can capture this information in a much smarter way (Finn et al., 2017).
 We prove that these bounds are in expectation, under a distribution of network parameters, supersets to the true bounds of this block.
In addition to these quantitative measures and jitterplots we assessed selectivity with a common qualitative measure, namely, human interpretation of images generated by a state-of-the-art activation maximization (AM) method (Nguyen et al., 2017).
 To this end, we slightly generalise the RWS algorithm to obtain a generic adaptive importance-sampling framework for variational inference which we term adaptive importance sampling for learning (AISLE) for ease of reference.
 Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
 A quadratic approximation technique and abacktracking algorithm are utilized to avoid matrix inversion.
The explanation also suggests that complex patterns are only learnable after learning rate decay.
 The decomposition focuses on the correlations between every data point and its K nearest neighbors 1.
Compared to the existing work, we make the following specific contributions:
Our experiments show that ISBNet is extremely efficient during inference and successfully selects only vital branches on a per-input basis.
 However, the process of manually tuning the tolerances is time-consuming and requires a large amount of computational budget.
 Moreover, we employ a new attention mechanism, which allows capturing of dependencies without regard to their distance in inputs, to replace the global pooling.
We demonstrate the efficacy of the explore-exploit approach by evaluating AutoLR across a wide range of models and datasets, ranging from NLP (SQuAD on BERT-base, Transformer on IWSLT) to CNNs (e.g, ImageNet on ResNet-50, Cifar-10 on ResNet18), and across multiple optimizers: SGD, Momentum and Adam.
 Another advantage of the fixed head size Transformer is, unlike the standard Transformer, which requires the number of heads to be a factor of the embedding size, we are free to set arbitrary number of heads as required for the task.
 Designing more efficient materials for photo-voltaic panels and more environmentally friendly materials for batteries are both very exciting research directions for using machine learning as a tool towards mitigating climate change (Niu et al., 2015; Tabor et al., 2018; Gebauer et al., 2019; Rolnick et al., 2019).
 On the search space from DARTS, when given a budget of 100 neural architecture queries for 50 epochs each, our algorithm achieves a best of 2.
 First, we generate a crude approximation y of the data which only takes c into account.
 We assign different weights to feature maps with different dilation rates in the channel dimensions.
 Then we use decreased degree of weight sharing, which shows lower variance and better performance, to support the reasoning.
Contributions.
The novelty of our design is salient in an ablation study where we compare it with a simple design.
 We use xh(k) to denote a k-sparse vector in CN consisting of the k largest (in absolute value) entries of x with all other entries zero.
 Our newly proposed feature map-based loss is to distill the feature map indirectly via discriminators.
In DP-ERM literature, there is a gap between the utility guarantee of non-strongly convex objectives and that of strongly convex objectives.
 We show good calibration results on a real-world dataset using a simple parametric model which scales the uncertainty by a constant factor.
 The experiment results show that DeepReduce can reduce the amount of testing data required for a reliable testing from 10,000 to 455 on average, which means that over 95.5% testing cost can be saved by DeepReduce.
 The loss function is designed in the light of the function of each part in the network, and we managed to find the best strategy of each part’s iteration renewal through experiments.
 (i) What determines the effectiveness of the attacker in reducing the accuracy of information aggregation? (ii) How well can agents learn adapt to the presence of an attacker? (iii) When attacker and agents learn simultaneously, how do policies evolve over time? Our results suggest three potential interventions to curb the effectiveness of fake news on social networks.
 In the context of metagenomic classification, we consider the instances to be DNA reads.
 Let z(L)i denotes the i th logit of an L layer fully-connected neural network with differentiable activation functions.
In this work we provide:
 Through learning over an adversarial loss, the agents are trained to achieve robust policies across various environments (Wulfmeier et al., 2017).
 Finally, Section 4 discusses some future directions.
 Third, we find that when networks are fine-tuned, ImageNet architectures generalize well on noisy data, with a correlation of r = 0.87 and 0.89 for synthetic and real-world noise, respectively.
 This unique integration of tree search into policy optimization yields a superior performance compared to baseline policy optimization techniques for continuous action spaces.
 We summarize our main contributions as follows:
 Based on these improved LR images, the latter sub-model continues to learn the mapping between (LR(C−JPG)) andHR.
 We focus our evaluation on top-10 accuracy, because there are many equally valuable reaction transformations for each input target, though only one is presented in the data.
 Our approach is more generalized, addressing any misspecification between noise distribution and the target distribution.
 A typical neural network model will update every parameter based on all of the inputs to minimize an objective function.
 In addition, we also show that CuBERT can be finetuned effectively using only 33% of the task-specific labeled data and with only 2 epochs, and that it attains results competitive to the baseline models trained with the full datasets and much larger number of epochs.
 Thus, we avoid adjusting labels across the entire dataset, like previous methods, while elevating the stability and average performance of the model.
 Finally, we adopt the actor-critic algorithm to update the model parameters.
 Furthermore, the algorithm is not sensitive to the model capacity.
 DMTS will only need to train one additional classifier and both the training and the running time are almost the same as the basic majority voting algorithm.
 This shows the effectiveness of the proposed method, as one would not know which perturbation scheme is the best beforehand.
 For example, LDA and some variants of it can already be approximated using variational autoencoders (Srivastava & Sutton, 2017; Card et al., 2018).
 First and foremost, the data distribution is likely to change in an online streaming environment where Bloom filters are deployed.
Lastly, embedding compression models not based on linear SVD (Khrulkov et al., (2019); Shu & Nakayama (2017); Shi & Yu (2018)) require the reconstruction of the entire embedding matrix or additional computations, when used at the output-layer.
 Based on the observation that the accuracy of an architecture using inherited weights should be predictive for the accuracy using optimized weights, we propose that the supernet training should be stochastic.
 We provide two practical implementations of controllers to enforce scores towards the desired right-skewed distributions, where the involved hyper-parameters can be easily set.
 Mapping and localization, an inherently spatial task with relevance to robotics, is one focus.
 In the rest of this paper, we first introduce CISTA, which can be naturally implemented using CNN architectures for solving the CSC problem.
 Besides, gfNN maintains an expected behavior in the aforementioned cases when other GNN models do not work.
 To address these shortcomings, we develop a TSC Score that quantifies the true test accuracy of compressed models trained using synthetic data; this offers a robust, goal-driven metric for synthetic data quality that accounts for both diversity and class affinity.
 We can compensate by scheduling an extra learning rate drop and training for an extra 10 epochs.
Contributions We summarize the main contributions of this work as follows:
 We provide our theoretical results in Section 4 and the result of our numerical comparisons in Section 5.
 The designed algorithm can effectively address above problems and is significantly faster than other popular search algorithms.
 We highlight several theoretical advantages of the proposed algorithms over the state-of-the-art methods as follows:
 From the second perspective, we prove that with linear discriminators, the training dynamics of CP-GAN can escape from mode-collapse; in addition, it has a global Lyapunov function that permits to prove global convergence.
 Specifically, we create a “coupling” of MDPs to generate two solutions for the given MIS problem and reward the agents for a large deviation between the solutions.
 In this way, the learned reward function is better shaped.
 This is intuitively necessary because a subset of coordinates in the stochastic gradient can not reflect the real descent direction and can make errors with higher probability than the original stochastic gradient.
 While we will focus on the ability of neural network to generalise from examples, two recent papers studied a network\\u2019s ability to store inputs with lower-dimensional structure and random labels: Chung et al., (2018) studied the linear separability of general, finite-dimensional manifolds, while Rotondo et al., (2019) extended Cover\\u2019s argument (Cover, 1965) to count the number of learnable dichotomies when inputs are grouped in tuples of k inputs with the same label.
 Meanwhile the training loss falls monotonically as the epoch budget increases, consistent with classical optimization theory.
 Touching objects are effectively disconnected as a side product.
 This head architecture could be efficiently learnt on a single GPU with a fully connected final output layer due to the small number of labels involved.
In this paper, we introduce a CPD variation for seasonal time series.
 Such a result is promising in the sense that we now know that self-attentive architectures are not a limiting factor for downstream classification performance.
 (1) It helps better understand our data, providing a path towards explainable AI.
 This formulation efficiently characterize the expansion of the metro line, without heavy constraints like existing studies (Wei et al., 2019).
 Recently proposed AutoVC (by Qian et al., (2019)) is the only framework for zero-shot VC.
 The change from the complex number ck to cke−i〈ωk,dx〉 corresponds to rotating a 2D vector by a 2× 2 matrix.
 The state si can be represented using m node blocks, each of which is a 1-hot vector that encodes the value of a different tuple element.
 We call the resulting algorithm nonuniformly quantized stochastic gradient descent (NUQSGD).
 Another advantage is that we can alter or combine representations in order to modify the information content.
 It is simple to implement, does not make the strong parametric assumptions, requires few modifications to the distilled ensemble model and works well in practice, thereby making it attractive to apply to a wide range of ensemble models and tasks.
 In Section 2 we present and discuss our method in details.
 As far as we know, this is the first work dealing with the feature interaction from the graph view.
The contributions of our paper are summarized below:
 We describe the creation of 3 new datasets in Section 3.
 Excitedly, the learned adjacency matrix in FC layer reveals local dependency for coefficients of CSS signals, which is suitable to be captured by convolution.
Our main contributions are:
 Particularly, we quantify the quality of text representations via generalization (perplexity), interpretability (topic coherence) and text retrieval.
 BN and dropout can only help in off-policy algorithms.
 The network is optimized to balance (a) difficulty of the puzzle w.r.t. the solver runtime, (b) diversity of generated puzzles, and (c) puzzle brevity.
 We also show that DSGC can be plugged into existing models to substantially improve their performance.
 Samples from our model are shown in Figure 1.
 The framework is also able to build on the previously learned knowledge to acquire new knowledge rapidly leading to faster learning.
 That is, links that fired are rewarded if the result was good, and actually also punished if it was not.
 Our result is better than the bound Ωpk´d´1q derived in Bietti and Mairal (2019) when d " k, which is clearly a more practical setting.
The rest of the paper organizes as follows.
 In Section 2, we present related work in modelbased DRL.
 To the best of our knowledge, ours is first adaptive solver that can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for RESNET-50 as adaptive solvers like Adam fail to obtain the accuracy of SGD with momentum for these tasks.
To test the proposed algorithm, we consider two applications.
 Notice that curvature captures how easily information flows between two nodes.
 This fact greatly hinders the tight integration of DPP with deep networks.
 In these cases, it requires additional transformation to have correct arithmetic results after quantizing the value into non-linear distribution.
 The input is a set of images.
 They use an attention model to learn the order of different nodes in a supervised fashion.
 Compared with uniform quantization, our method can decrease 22% computational cost, demonstrating the proposed algorithm is hardware-friendly.
There does not exist a standard method to quantify the fuzziness of knowledge consistency (i.g, the difficulty of feature transformation).
2Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020
 In this way, our model eliminates mode collapse and mode mixture successfully.
 Firstly, we apply different maximization techniques while keeping the minimization loss CE unchanged.
We evaluate our model on five standard text classification datasets (Lang, 1995; Lewis et al., 2004; Lewis, 1997; He & McAuley, 2016; Misra, 2018) and one relation classification dataset (Han et al., 2018).
 We show they create natural observations that are adversarial to the victim and push the activations of the victim’s policy network off-distribution.
 Empirical results demonstrate the validity of our approach and the advantages of our learned RLP policy in terms of training efficiency and generalization ability.
 Typically in stage reallocation, we exploit a reusable model to reduce stage-level searching cost and adapt different computational requirements.
Although GAIL has achieved significant empirical progresses, its theoretical properties are still largely unknown.
 Such a target-agnostic attack has two consequences: I) the crafting time is irrelevant because adversarial images are crafted only once and then they can be used on any model that used the pre-trained model during the transfer learning stage (that is why the attack is called target-agnostic), and II) it does not need to query the target model to craft images.
 We implemented the proposed methods and demonstrated significant performance gains over previous work (Narodytska et al., 2018; Khalil et al., 2019; Baluta et al., 2019).
 We further empirically show that the inherent stochasticity introduced by our method allows training without paired samples, and the one-to-many image-to-image translation is achieved using a stochastic auto-encoder where stochasticity prevents the network from learning a trivial identity mapping.
 In the latter, Bernstein et al., (2018) analyzed signSGD, a sign-based Stochastic Gradient Descent, and showed that it enjoys a faster empirical convergence than SGD in addition to the cost reduction of communicating gradients across multiple workers.
Our main contributions are as follows:1Whether such a solution is exactly a local minimum or not is debatable (see Sec 2).
 As our bound is the first direct analysis of the robust test error, it presents a marked improvement over existing work which analyze loose relaxations of the adversarial error (Khim and Loh, 2018; Yin et al., 2018).
 The token-level masked-LM (MLM) pretraining task is crucial to the success of BERT-style cross-attention models.
 This means there is no scope for mistakes of any kind – no wrong turn at a crossroad, no back-tracking from a dead-end, no exploration or deviation of any kind from the shortest-path.
 For few-shot learning, T-NAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets (Omniglot, Mini-Imagenet, Fewshot-CIFAR100) compared with previous methods and other NAS-based methods.
 Based on this insight, we shall see later how a simple modification to GD to suppress the weak gradient directions can dramatically reduce overfitting.
 Thus we use reinforcement learning to adjust weights based upon the counterfactual problem: what would be the optimal number of steps of computation, given a particular number of steps was taken this time? The use of REINFORCE to perform variable amount of computation has been investigated already (e.g, Shen et al., 2017; Louizos et al., 2017) however our approach differs in that we added an extra term to the REINFORCE loss that, by exploiting the mathematical properties of binary random variables, naturally minimizes the expected number of computation steps.
 To summarize, we list our main contributions:
 All results of experiments show MABN with small batch size (1 or 2) can achieve comparable performance as BN with regular batch size (see Figure 1(b)).
As alluded to above, we analyze networks with d inputs, k outputs, and m ě maxtd, ku nodes in each hidden layer.
 As a result, the model’s generalization performance will degenerate due to this systematic error.
4For any symmetric matrix S ∈ Rn×n and an orthogonal matrix A ∈ O(n;R), the projection of SA onto the orthogonal group is A: PO(n;R) SA = A, one may see Absil & Malick (2012) for details.
 Thus, our model uses this learned predictability along with the associated location and energy representation to cluster the events in the energy stream.
 Our proposed post-local SGD (A5) (defined by starting local SGD from the model obtained by large-batch SGD (A2) at epoch 150) closes this generalization gap with the single-machine baseline (A1) and is also more communication efficient than the mini-batch competitors.
 In this paper we focus fully on learning to optimize this cost model, leaving integration with a compiler for future work.
 Liu et al., (2019) and Yang et al., (2019) argued that the next sentence prediction objective of BERT (the monolingual model) is not very useful; we show that this is the case in the cross-lingual setting.
 Our method is shown to significantly outperform other adversarial and non-adversarial methods.
 Estimating gradients of MI rather than estimating MI may be a better approach for MI optimization.
 It alerts us to rethink the practicality of AutoML in terms of design cost.
 Surprisingly, a point mass and an ant in MuJoCo (Todorov et al., 2012) can imitate each other to navigate in a maze environment.
 A better strategy results from restricting the set of relevant pattern orientations by defining them relative to one another1It is achieved by developing feature mappings that utilize the transformation group in the feature mapping itself (e.g, translating a filter in the course of a feature transformation is used to obtain translation equivariance).(e.g, mouth orientation relative to the eyes) as opposed to absolutely (e.g, upright mouth) (fig. 2d).
From an informal perspective, both AFD and AFS learn to adjust the “valves” that control the flow of information for each channel neuron.
 The operator is used to indicate element-wise multiplication of two vectors.
Specifically, our contributions in this paper include:
 Our analysis stands on the implicit bias hypothesis (Gunasekar et al., 2018; Ji & Telgarsky, 2019) that claims deep learning tends to produce rather simple models.
 Inspired by those two observations, we raise an enlightening question about the aggregation scheme in graph neural network.
 The most interesting insight is that E is a knob controlling the convergence rate: neither setting E over-small (E = 1 makes FedAvg equivalent to SGD) nor setting E over-large is good for the convergence.
 In detail, we mimic the forward and backward passes of the neural network to update the embedding vectors.
 The second part is a multilayer network called Post-Processing Network which gradually enforces the constraints and restrict the output space.
 Given two successive capsule-layers, not all pairs of capsule-types have significant relationships.
 More information can be referred to Section 3.3
 We remark that we do not design the weighting scheme heuristically from scratch.
 First, it shows denser networks (intervals of 1 and 2) can achieve lower training losses in the majority of cases.
 Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods not only outperform existing adversarial training methods, e.g, PGM training, but also enjoy the computational efficiency over CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets (Krizhevsky and Hinton, 2009).
 Moreover, we prove that these bounds are much tighter, in expectation (will be formalized later) than the IBP bounds (Gowal et al., 2019) generated by propagating the input bounds through every layer in the block.
 AM images are generated to strongly activate individual units, and some of them are interpretable by humans (e.g, a generated image that looks like a lighthouse, see fig. 1).
 Furthermore, RLIF can be easily extended into neuromorphic chips since its peculiarity of hardware-friendly.
 We then show that AISLE admits not only RWS but also the IWAE-DREG and IWAE-STL gradients as special cases.
 Every subproblem has a closed-form solution, further boosting efficiency.
 Thus, when the model learns all simple patterns, but the epoch to decay has not reached, immediately decaying the learning rate will not hurt the performance.
 LAIN also eliminates the need for a data ordering.
 It can strengthen feature extraction from several inputs.
Point (1) is essential for full tomography-like solutions as will be explained in the sequel.
 In all cases, AutoLR matches or beats test accuracy of state-of-theart hand-tuned learning rate schedules.
We evaluate this fixed head size Transformer on language modeling (LM1B dataset), natural language inference (MNLI dataset) and question answering tasks (SQuAD dataset).
 Many of the compounds of interest are crystal structuresmade of single small sub-units that repeat in all directions.
57% and average of 2.
 The result is a blurry average of the data points conditioned on c, see Figure 2 (right).
 The weights are acquired through learning, and more weight and attention are given to the feature channels with greater roles.
 As an initial effort, a single-layer neural network has been employed to predict winning probabilities of unseen group matches (Menke & Martinez, 2008).
 For example, if x = 4, 5,−9, 1T then xh(2) = 0, 5,−9, 0T .
 We use the feature map from the last convolution layer since deeper convolution layer generates more meaningful features with a high-level abstraction (Kim et al., 2018).
 Our deep learning aided solution concept makes it practical to solicit complex sample information from human agents.
 However, by using the expected curvature, we show that some of the non-strongly convex objectives can achieve the same order of utility guarantee as the strongly convex objectives, matching the empirical observation.
 As opposed to (Kuleshov et al., 2018), we show that our approach cannot calibrate predicted uncertainty that is uncorrelated with the real uncertainty, as one would expect.
 During training, dual Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is utilized to optimize the parameters.
 Compared with the state-of-the-art approach (Li et al., 2019), DeepReduce is more stable and reliable, and can reduce more testing data.
 The role of the theme modeling module is to make the generated summary semantically close to the article.
 When presented with novel data our model is able to distinguish between unseen data from various datasets and data belonging to known tasks.
 To solve this problem with previous methods, we would need to solve a linear program with over 1015 constraints.
 For neural networks with ReLU activation functions, it is invariant under layer-wise reparameterization, addressing a shortcoming of previous measures of flatness.
 First, “vaccinate” users of social networks by making them aware of the presence of fake news.
 Our goal is to directly predict the distribution over a given set of taxonomic ranks in the read set (the bag).
 We find that our theoretical results consistently hold across all our experiments.
 Then, the curvature of the neural network function is globally bounded as follows:mI ≼ ∇2xz (L) i ≼MI, ∀x ∈ R Dwhere m and M can be computed efficiently using parameters of the network.
 However, these and other reported architectures do not necessarily lead to improved sample efficiency, handle relatively minor changes in the transition model, and are even known to cause negative transfer.
 This finding generalizes Kornblith et al., (2019)’s finding, i.g,ImageNet architectures generalize well across clean datasets, to the noisy data.
2. Policy bootstrapping.
 Therefore, an integrated pipeline for SR representation between C-JPG and HR images is achieved through the jointly two sub-models.
 This means that our approach does not become redundant or unnecessary in the case of single complex manifolds, for example.
 While this is desired for many applications, full input based learning can cause issues for others (Pascanu et al., 2012).
 CuBERT when finetuned on the variable misuse localization and repair task, produces high classification, localization and localization+repair accuracies.
 Further, instead of being pre-computed by an alternative model, these softer distributions are generated on-the-fly from the outputs of the model being trained.
We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the models and the results show that the CQL model greatly outperforms the vanilla model which produces sub-actions in one step forward propagation without query.
 When insufficient model capacity is given, our algorithm does not collapse to a constant function.
 Therefore our proposed methods are very practical to implement and run.
 Furthermore, the proposed algorithm might outperform any of them when the complementariness of different perturbation schemes are exploited.
 In particular, Card et al., (2018) show how to approximate supervised LDA (McAuliffe & Blei, 2008) in a neural net framework that they call SCHOLAR; they specifically consider classification as the supervised task although they mention that their framework could be used to predict other real-valued outputs.
 Data streams are known to have bursty nature with drift in distribution (Kleinberg, 2003).
 State-ofthe-art results can be achieved.
 Thus, the model either uses the same amount of memory as the uncompressed model or requires additional computation cost.
 All architectures have their weights optimized simultaneously.
 However, we want to avoid only experimenting with tasks naturally fit to the architecturally-induced biases of our memory networks.
 Then we develop a framework for CSC based image SR, which can address the Framework Issue.
 We propose to use neural network to model the surrogate model (dubbed as neural surrogate model) to substitute the mean of function values in GP.
 Previous works either ignore it or treat it independently from network structure.
 In summary, we make the following principal contributions:
 This method fails when used for oversampling an under-represented class whereby knowledge of spatial proximity between scene image data points must be preserved, an important requirement under the framework of learning deep features over neighboring scene images introduced in this work.
 On a challenging grid-world navigation task, our method outperforms (a re-implementation of) Goyal et al., (2019).
 Therefore the training is deterministic2, implying that the model will be not affected by the posterior collapse when the decoder is more complex or followed by additional losses such as the adversarial loss and the perceptual loss.
 Furthermore, we show that the fine tuning stage enables better and more stable personalized performance.
 Besides that, a method is put forward to estimate them.
 The resulting reward efficiently stimulates the agent to explore high-dimensional input spaces and to improve the performance at the evaluation.
 The weight vector assigns suitable preference to additional objectives and reduces the return of sub-optimal trajectories, so as to make the objective function of maximizing the cumulative undiscounted return consistent with the optimal policy.
 This memory gradient based sparse communication strategy has been widely adopted by recent communication compression methods and has achieved better performance than quantization methods and other sparse communication methods without memory gradient.
Accessibility and reproducibility The full code of our experiments can be accessed via https: //drive.
 More surprisingly, the learning rate that maximizes the final test accuracy decays very slowly as the epoch budget increases, while the learning rate that minimizes the training loss decays rapidly.
 The word-vector embeddings were then transferred to the tail network where there wasn’t enough data available to train them from scratch.
 The issue of seasonal CPD has also been addressed by Lund et al., (14) where they developed a test for periodic and auto correlated time series.
In this paper, we attempt to inspire from a few key engineering deicisons that have benefitted the various successful approaches discussed above to motivate our design of a generative pre-training method for images.
 (2) It gives a better control on the generation process of novel samples.
 Our reweighted-RNN model employs different soft-thresholding functions that are adaptively learned per hidden unit.
Following this formulation, we propose an actor critic model (Konda & Tsitsiklis, 2000) to generate the next metro line.
 Inspired by this, we propose AdaGAN for zero-shot VC as an independent study, which is the first GAN-based framework to perform zeroshot VC.
 This is achieved by using a novel special neuron activation unit (SAU), a non-spiking activation function, that facilitates integration of the SNN extracted features within the DNN thereby creating a single fully-trainable deep network.
 However, we emphasize that our model does not assume Fourier basis or its localized version such as Gabor filters.
 The key aspect of a factorial HMM is that the stochastic transition matrix (update in Figure 1d) is fully block-diagonal.
 Like QSGD, NUQSGD is a quantized data-parallel SGD algorithm with strong theoretical guarantees that allows the user to trade off communication costs with convergence speed.
 The usefulness of these characteristics becomes apparent in retrieval applications.
 This is followed by a section with experiments and passing to conclusions.
 Moreover, to model the interaction between different samples, we proposed a novel sample interaction component which can capture the high-order sample interaction both linearly and exponentially.
 In Section 4 we introduce our new physics informed DNN for accurate energy estimation, which we evaluate in Section 5.
 Although this work specially focuses on CSS, it gives further insights to other structured problems beyond SR.
 In both cases we observe significant performance improvements.
 The code is provided with the supplementary.
Our proposed algorithms have multiple use cases in annotating datasets for segmentation.
 When the solver is trainable, this generation process results in an adversarial setup, where Troublemaker finds increasingly hard problems as the training progresses.
 The descending range varies in different downstream transfer learning tasks.
 Therefore, a discriminator aware of the competitive nature of the game will try to find a trade-off between achieving a low loss and being robust to the actions of the generator, and vice versa.
 Our experiments show that such DNNs can also learn to classify quite well, comparable to SGD.
 We survey the most relevant work in the rest of the section.
 In Section 3, we provide the requisite background on RL and MPC.
 It resorts to dynamically generating sparse matching mask according to Hungarian sampling during training, rather than approximating Hungarian sampling with a differentiable function.
 The first application is to train a SNN, and we leverage `1-regularization, that is,minimize x1m m∑ i=1 fi(x,yi) + µ||x||1.
 Within a well-connected community, neighborhoods of adjacent nodes have large overlap and many shortcuts.
 Some alternative methods seek to reach diversity under more constrained settings.
 For example, as in Han et al., (2016); Park et al., (2017), it necessitates the operation of table lookup to have correct multiplication between quantized values.
 Each image (bag) has a label of ucc1 (image is fully normal or fully metastases) or ucc2 (image is a mixture of normal and metastases).
 Later Bello et al., (2016) develop an RL algorithm to train the Pointer Network.
 This method is agnostic to the attack method, does not require retraining of the CNN and can be integrated with existing transformation-based methods.
 For simplification, we use non-linear transformations during feature reconstruction to approximate the fuzziness.
 As shown in Figure 1(b), the final robustness is barely affected when we use a weak attack (e.g, Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) (Goodfellow et al., 2015)) to perturb misclassified examples S− (all other training examples are still perturbed by PGD10).
 Additionally, we find policies are easier to attack in high-dimensional environments.
 Our results achieve the state-of-the-art iteration complexity for non-convex concave min-max problems.
 This local minima valley may have several parallel valleys that are in the same equivalence class but do not appear because of the restraints of cell boundaries.
 In our experiments, RLP improves overall training time by 44% and 28% on average in comparison to the best existing policy in simulated and real cluster environments, respectively.
 There are three major difficulties when analyzing GAIL: 1).
 Hence, an attack can craft a set of adversarial images on VGG face model, as an example, and then uses them effectively on any re-trained model based on VGG face.
 We get more than 10x-20x improvements on tested benchmarks for both verification and quantitative queries, e.g, finding the probability that a perturbation yields an adversarial example.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
 Liu et al., (2019) extended signSGD to zeroth-order setup with the ZO-SignSGD algorithm.
 Finally, our analysis of generalization for the clean setting translates directly to the adversarial setting with almost no additional steps.
 For the former, we achieve close to the performance of non-private models and significantly improve upon the performance of models trained with local-DP guarantees, a previously studied notion that also provides protections against the meta-learner.
 Nevertheless, what pre-training tasks are useful for improving two-tower Transformer models in large-scale retrieval, remains a crucial yet unsolved research problem.
 Our hypothesis is that the model learns to exploit the statistical regularities in the floor-plans of indoor environments (apartments, offices) in our datasets.
 As for supervised learning, a 200-shot 50-query 10-way experiment setting is designed on the Mini-Imagenet dataset.
In addition to providing insight into why GD generalizes in practice, we believe that the Coherent Gradients hypothesis can help explain several other empirical observations about deep learning in the literature:(a) Learning is slower with random labels than with real labels (Zhang et al., 2017; Arpit et al., 2017)(b) Robustness to large amounts of label noise (Rolnick et al., 2017) (c) Early stopping leads to better generalization (Caruana et al., 2000) (d) Increasing capacity improves generalization (Caruana et al., 2000; Neyshabur et al., 2018) (e) The existence of adversarial initialization schemes (Liu et al., 2019) (f) GD detects common patterns even when trained with random labels (Chatterjee &Mishchenko, 2019) 1While the mechanism is easiest to see with full or large minibatches, we believe it holds even for smallminibatches (though there one has to consider the bias in updates over time).
 Thus we directly encourage our network to explicitly prefer representations and computation that minimize the amount of required computation.
 Besides, it has same inference consumption as vanilla BN (see Figure 1(a)).
 Linear transformations that are fixed throughout training map the inputs to the first hidden layer, and the last hidden layer to the outputs.
 To reduce the systematic error produced by training with noisy labels, several methods have been proposed.
5For any 1 ≤ k ≤ n, St(n, k;R) .
 In addition, we use a mixture distribution to disentangle irrelevant location information of other residents in the home.
 Our method, without any LM training, is on par and often outperforms the baselines on attribute relevance and fluency (Section 4.2, and Section 4.3).
 Unlike Pearson correlation and HSIC, which only capture linear dependence, Rényi correlation captures any statistical dependence between random variables as zero Rényi correlation implies independence.
 In direct comparison, post-local SGD is more communication-efficient than mini-batch SGD (while less than local SGD).
We structure the neural network’s task as predicting proposal distributions to use in the search over execution decisions, rather than the decisions themselves directly.
 Voita et al., (2019) prunes attention heads for a transformer based machine translation model and argues that most attention heads are not important; in this work, we show that the number of attention heads is not important in the cross-lingual setting.
 Disentangling class and content representations assumes that intra-class variation is significantly lower than inter-class variation.
 To this end, to the best of our knowledge, we firstly propose the Mutual Information Gradient Estimator (MIGE) in representation learning.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
 In such a way, we are able to exploit information about orientation co-occurrences in the data without disrupting equivariance.
 The former adjusts the strength of regularization, thereby tuning the flow of knowledge being transferred from the source model.
 The support of a vector is denoted as supp(x) := {i|xi 6= 0}.
 We also evaluate 10 recent advanced NAS1One parallel concurrent work for the similar purpose is NAS-Bench-1SHOT1 (Zela et al., 2020).
 Actually, Gunasekar et al., (2018); Ji & Telgarsky (2019) showed gradient descent results in (near) low rank parameter matrices in each layer in linear network settings.
 In section 3 we provide experiments on popular classification tasks to support our theoretical analysis.
• Can the aggregation on a graph benefit from a continuous latent space, such as using geometry in the space to build structural neighborhoods and capture long-range dependencies in the graph?To answer the above question, we propose a novel aggregation scheme for graph neural networks, termed the geometric aggregation scheme.
This work also makes algorithmic contributions.
 In addition, the proposed GNN allows a customised schedule to update embedding vectors via shared parameters.
 It is designed based on an unrolled algorithm for solving a constrained optimization.
 This is due to them either representing object-components that are part of different classes, or being just incompatible in compositional structures.
 Instead, it is naturally motivated by the gradient analysis of several loss functions.
 Second, the optimal topology is different for different node types (2 for conv, 1 for depthwise and inverted bottleneck).
The research on L2L has a long history (Schmidhuber, 1987; 1992; 1993; Younger et al., 2001; Hochreiter et al., 2001; Andrychowicz et al., 2016).
 Our bounds get even tighter as the number of hidden nodes in the first affine layer increases.
 For the first time, we systematically evaluated the interpretability of the AM images and compare these ratings with the selectivity measures for corresponding units.
Contributions.
 These nice properties come after several technical innovations.
 This approach employs learnable gating networks such as the convolutional neural networks to compute good error tolerances for the ODE solvers.
 We conduct extensive experiments on several public text classification datasets.
 The extension of the loss function by the L∞-like norm is fundamental.
 For example, on SQuAD v1.1 fine-tuning with BERTBASE, AutoLR is able achieve an EM score of 81.2, compared to 80.8 reported in Devlin et al., (2018) by just auto-tuning the learning rate schedule (all other parameters were unchanged).
 We show that the modified Transformer trained with an embedding size of 512 can match the performance of the BERTLARGE(Devlin et al., 2018), a Transformer with an embedding size of 1024 (see fig. 2).
 This sub-unit is referred to as a “unit cell” and can vary in size and shape as well as internal arrangement and chemical composition.
64% test error, which beats all NAS algorithmswith which we could fairly compare (e.g, same search space used, and same hyperparameters for the final training).
 We then feed this crude approximation into a GAN-based generative model which adds the rest of the details conditioned on z.
 The advantages of a shallow feature extraction network with a large receptive field are twofold.
 MNLI, is not the best performing on DiscEval, which suggests a margin for improvements.
 It has shown a promising result, demonstrating prediction accuracy to be improved on a real-world online game dataset, but also exhibited a scalability issue.
 Note that xh(k) may not be uniquely defined.
 The adversarial training scheme of generative adversarial networks (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) is utilized to transfer the knowledge at feature map-level.
 This is because the expected curvature could be relatively large even for non-strongly convex objectives.
To summarize, our main contributions are:
 The experiment results also shows that DeepReduce can be used in performance estimation in regression scenarios.
 The module uses a semantic classifier trained using a discriminative objective function.
 Furthermore, we demonstrate our algorithms superiority by outperforming the current state of the art in terms of CPU times.
 Second, keep private information on social networks private so that attackers cannot target poorly informed or well connected users.
 So for each taxon, our output is a real number in 0, 1 denoting the portion of the reads in the read set that originated from that particular species.
This result along with the min-max theorem leads to the following curvature robustness certificate:Theorem (informal) 2.
 In contrast, our approach directly adapts the source policies to target with significant transition model difference while interacting with the environment.
Our contribution is twofold.
 Its difficulty relies on how one measures the interpretability discrepancy caused by input perturbations.
In short, there are mainly three contributions in this study:
 When we create a split of the data based on different reaction templates (a task that any template-based model would fail on), we similarly observe a performance increase for our model.
Our contributions can be summarized as:
 We are the first work to learn from implicit signals in conversation offline using batch RL.
 Though the rewards in this paper are designed for object search, the method itself is general and can be applied to other tasks.
 Ke et al., (2018) attempt to solve this issue via selective attentive backtracking, though they focus on remembering long-term dependencies rather than utilizing the full context of the input.
 The contributions of this paper are as follows:
 We apply LILAC to three standard image benchmarks and compare its performance to the strongest known baselines.
 In addition, the CQL model achieves lower bin gap ratio in both 2D and 3D packing compared with extant learning approaches and heuristic algorithms.
 Instead, it trains a model as robust as possible.
Our contributions summarize as follows:
 We specifically combine their approach with that of Katzman et al., (2018) to handle survival supervision.
 As a result, the confidence of the classifier, and hence the threshold, is not completely reliable.
 This makes linear SVD based techniques more desirable for running models on edge-devices.
 When the stochastic gradients are `∞-bounded, (1.1) matches the convergence rate of SGD in terms of the rate of T .
 This gives rise to a uniform sampling strategy.
 It avoids the non-trivial hyper-parameter tuning on ad hoc constraints and also improves the faithfulness of mimicking target black-box classifiers.
 Therefore, we also train them to perform the same kind of algorithmic tasks used in analyzing the capabilities of NTMs and DNCs.
 Subsequently, CRNet-A (CSC and Residual learning based Network) and CRNet-B inspired by this framework are proposed for image SR.
 We further design a ranking loss for fitting surrogate model to sampled points to make surrogate model insensitive to the scale of function values.
 This allows us to use a distance-based outlier detection classifier3.
 It verifies that our method is general and brings a unified perspective regarding pair sampling and complicated loss over all pairs within a batch.
 We prove convergence of this scheme to a local critical point for feed-forward neural networks which are piece-wise analytic functions and continuously differentiable.
 These experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can not only be much more efficient than existing AutoML algorithms, but also can achieve much better performance than the state-of-the-art sample-selection approaches designed by humans.
 Our modification to the loss function has some similarity with the Wasserstein distance (coupling data points), but it turns out it works better than WGAN-GP on all datasets we tested.
We empirically validate the AutoDP method on various types of graphs including the Erdös-Rényi (Erdős & Rényi, 1960) model, the Barabási-Albert (Albert & Barabási, 2002) model, the SATLIB (Hoos & Stützle, 2000) benchmark and real-world graphs (Hamilton et al., 2017; Yanardag & Vishwanathan, 2015; Leskovec & Sosič, 2016).
 Through theoretical analysis, our algorithm effectively overcomes the problems of delayed reward and myopic policy in the objectiveconstrained task.
 In these memory gradient based sparse communication methods, some are for vanilla SGD (Aji & Heafield, 2017; Alistarh et al., 2018; Stich et al., 2018; Karimireddy et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2019).
 We give necessary parameter values to reproduce our figures beneath each plot.
These results provide further evidence that the noise in stochastic gradients can enhance generalization in some cases, and they suggest novel hyper-parameter tuning strategies that may reduce the cost of identifying the optimal learning rate and optimal epoch budget.
 Accuracy gains could potentially be obtained by fine tuning the embeddings but this led to a dramatic increase in the training and prediction costs.
 However, this test is based on predefined statistics and focuses on median (level) change of the metric.
 1.Predicting subscales and low-bit depth for pixels: (Menick & Kalchbrenner, 2018) showed that modeling pixels by sequentially modeling the subscales and low-bit depthversions of the raw image is extremely useful.
 (3) The disentanglement of latent factors may provide an opportunity to distinguish anomalies based on the landscape of latent space, which is our interest in this paper.
 Furthermore, the proposed model is over-parameterized, has high expressivity and can be efficiently stacked.
 The actor is based on the seq2seq model (Sutskever et al., 2014).
 We reported initial results for zero-shot VC using AdaGAN.
 The supervised (SGD-based) training is performed in that deep network after freezing the STDP-learnt weights in the spiking CNN module.
 The model figures it out with generic vector and matrix representations.
 The affect matrix is 0, since the HMM graphical model does not feed the output back into the next state; the depend matrix is unrestricted.
 Unlike QSGD, NUQSGD has strong empirical performance on deep models and large datasets, matching that of QSGDinf.
 We will demonstrate that it allows one to retrieve an image similar to a particular image but with altered information content.
 Extensive experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed method.
 We conclude in Section 6.
 The result also suggests that proper regularization can sometimes ease the hyperparameter tuning process.
Contributions
 However, the proposed RPP approach is able to achieve a consistently high pruning ratio compared to iterative pruning based methods.
 Based on this observation, we propose to mitigate the lack of stability in GAN training by choosing more realistic models of the agents’ behavior.
 Notably, it is differentiable with respect to the 3D vertex coordinates.
 This is less likely to be true for the human experience as the distribution of classes seems to be more skewed towards the current experience over the recent ones.
Our Contributions.
 We show that the error terms from different frequencies are provably controlled by the eigenvalues of the NTK, and the lowerfrequency components can be learned with less training examples and narrower networks with a faster convergence rate.
 Preliminaries are introduced in Section 2.
 In Section 4, we introduce our method.
 As such, the Hungarian attention introduces higher smoothness against traditional loss functions to ease the training.
 (2)The second application is to train a binary neural network (BNN) where the weights (and activations) are either 1 or -1 (see Courbariaux et al., (2015; 2016); Hou et al., (2017); Yin et al., (2018); Bai et al., (2019) for more details).
 The corresponding curvature is positive and passing information between the nodes is easy.
 For example, Zhang et al., (2017) resorted to a global pairwise orthogonality constraint in hyper-sphere and Zadeh et al., (2017) employed statistical moments to measure the diversity.
 However, the linear quantization can make full use of the low-precision arithmetic components in off-the-shelf accelerators.
 Our aim is to segment the pixels (instances) in the image into normal and metastases.
 Their framework learns the optimal policy from problem instances and needs no supervised solutions.
 To this end, we propose a model gk for feature reconstruction.
 The method converges to the unique global optimum with bounded error estimate.
 This suggests that different maximization techniques on misclassified examples S− may have a negligible influence on the final robustness, provided that the inner maximization problem is solved to a moderate precision (Wang et al., 2019).
The paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we introduce notations and preliminary results.
 For instance, our model outperforms prototypical networks by 20.6% on average in one-shot text classification and 17.3% in one-shot relation classification.
As deep RL is increasingly deployed in environments with potential adversaries, we believe it is important that practitioners are aware of this previously unrecognized threat model.
 This strictly improves the previous best known result due to Delayed Q-learning.
 If ignoring such constraints, all the equivalence classes constitute a quotient space.
 Moreover, RLP is able to generalize to multiple unseen circumstances.
 The discovered models show great transferablity over other detection neck/head, e.g, NAS-FPN (Cai & Vasconcelos, 2018), other dataset, e.g, PASCAL VOC (Everingham et al., 2015) and other vision tasks, e.g, instance segmentation (He et al., 2017).
 There exists temporal dependency in the demonstration trajectories/data due to their sequential nature (Howard, 1960; Puterman, 2014; Abounadi et al., 2001); 2).
 ZO-SignSGD (Liu et al., 2019) was shown to outperform NES against a blackbox model on MNIST.
 This is an additional advantage of our all-layer margin definition.
 In this paper, we aim to answer this question by studying different pre-training tasks for the two-tower Transformer models.
 The more challenging task of navigating purely from an RGB camera without GPS+Compass demonstrates progress but remains an open frontier.
 Compared with the searched architectures from scratch for new given tasks, T-NAS achieves comparable performance but with 50x less searching cost.
A direct experimental verification of the Coherent Gradients hypothesis is challenging since the notion of similarity between examples depends on the parameters of the network and thus changes during training.
To sum up, our contributions are:
 The partial gradients of hiddenstate vectors for iRNNs converge to identity, thus solving vanishing/exploding gradient problem!
 We also conducted sufficient ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of MABN further.
 We prove that our bounds hold with high probability when these input and output transformations are randomly generated by Gaussian distributions.
 They can be categorized into three kinds: transition matrix based method (Sukhbaatar et al., 2014; Patrini et al., 2017; Goldberger & Ben-Reuven, 2017), regularization based method (Miyato et al., 2016) and sample selection based method (Jiang et al., 2018; Han et al., 2018b).
 These regularizers recover common GAN stabilization techniques such as gradient penalties and spectral normalization, thereby placing their use on a firmer theoretical foundation.
= {W ∈ Rn×k : W ∗W = Ik}.
 Interestingly, our model not only learns when each appliance is activated but also discovers the location of that appliance in the home, all without any labeled data.
 It achieves better generalization performance than both these algorithms.
 Empirically we have found the direct prediction approach to be too slow at inference time for our application and generalizes poorly.
Our contributions are threefold:
 We discover that this assumption can be relaxed by clustering in-class styles into separate classes.
 In detail, we estimate the score function of an implicit distribution, ∇x log q(x), to achieve a general-purpose MI gradient estimation for representation learning.
 The set of co-occurrent orientations in fig.  2d corresponds to the co-occurrence envelope of the samples in fig.  2a for the transformation group defined by rotations.
 The latter allows salient information to pass on to the subsequent layer and stops the flow of unimportant information.
 We use supxs as the simplified form of supxs∈X (B,s,0), see Assumption 1 for the definition of X (B, s, 0).
algorithms including reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods, evolutionary strategy (ES)-based methods, differentiable-based methods, etc.
 Martin & Mahoney (2018) evaluated the eigenvalue decays of the weight matrix through random matrix theories and several numerical experiments.
 It is interesting to contrast this simple linear relation with the more complicated picture observed for the scaling of the learning rate with the batch size.
 In the scheme, we map a graph to a continuous latent space via node embedding, and then use the geometric relationships defined in the latent space to build structural neighborhoods for aggregation.
 That means, once training is done, the trained GNN model is applicable to various verification properties on different neural network structures.
 These two networks are coupled together and learnedjointly in an end-to-end fashion.
 The consequences of this inefficiency go beyond poor scalability.
Interestingly, GR can be naturally connected to examples weighting, robust losses, explicit regularisation: 1) The gradient magnitude of logit vector can be regarded as weight assignment that is built-in in loss functions (Gopal, 2016; Alain et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018b).
 It is possible due to that not all connections are beneficial, and the aggregation of features should be discretionary.
 The basic idea is that one first models the updating formula of complicated optimization algorithms in a parametric form, and then uses some simple algorithms, e.g, stochastic gradient algorithm to learn the parameters of the optimizer.
 We show that the few hidden units with interpretable AM images are not highly selective.
 Novel material is presented in Section 3, where we introduce the AISLEframework.
 The model assumptions are very mild, ensuring that most deep learning problems will satisfy our assumptions.
Contribution 3: We study methods to improve the large-batch training of InfoCNF including tuning and learning the error tolerances of the ODE solvers, as well as increasing the learning rates.

 We further present experimental results evaluating the effect of different choices of the head size and the embedding size in the Section 4.
In this work, we present a method for encoding and decoding a very important set of 3-D molecules that can not be represented using standard methods used for drug-like molecules.
Our NAS algorithm has several moving parts, including the meta neural network, the path-based feature encoding of neural architectures, the acquisition function, and the acquisition optimization strategy.
 We call this framework CZ-GEM.
 One advantage is that the network can meet the two requirements of the stereo matching task for the feature extraction network.
 We show improvements in transfer problems in natural language processing and computer vision problems.
 It requires one input node per item, making it prohibitive to be extended to realworld applications with a large number of items.
 In contexts where a unique meaning for xh(k) is needed, we can choose xh(k) out of all possible candidates according to a predefined rule (such as the lexicographic order).
The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:
As we mentioned earlier, prior to our work, there is a mismatch between theoretical guarantee and empirical observation of gradient perturbation approach compared with other two perturbation approaches.
 This dataset can support further research on the super resolution domain, and can be utilized either for training or as a fair benchmark.
In summary, we make the following contributions in this work:
 Third, encourage the formation of “balanced” rather than clustered or fragmented social networks, so that information can “flow” effectively across the network.
We hope this work will direct the attention of the meta RL community towards this research direction.
 The motivation for this is that in a realistic set of reads, closely related organisms tend to appear together.
 Consider a network whose curvature values are bounded.
 It enjoys empirically and rigorously proven sample efficiency guarantees of order O(nH), depending polynomially on the horizon length “H”.
 First, we establish a large benchmark of controlled real image search noise.

 To validate ROS-HPL, we conduct extensive sets of experiments on the House3D (Wu et al., 2018) simulation environment, and report the observed results that validate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed system over other state-of-the-art systems for object search.
 In this work, we introduce a method that performs objective-based filtering during learning, but still utilizes the entire input.
While incremental and continual learning work on evolving data distributions with the addition of memory constraints ((Rebuffi et al., 2017; Castro et al., 2018) and derivative works), knowledge distillation ((Schwarz et al., 2018; Rolnick et al., 2018) and similar works) or other requirements, this work is a departure into using negative mining and focused training to improve learning on a fully available dataset.
 Specifically, our model improves 7.2% space utilization ratio in 3D packing (30 boxes) compared with genetic algorithm, and reduces more than 10% bin gap ratio in almost every case compared with the state-of-the-art learning approaches.
 Secondly, the susceptibility of machine learning oracles to adversarial examples brings new vulnerability in the system.
In this paper, we introduce Distilled Embedding, a non-linear matrix factorization method, which outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.
 To reduce the weight coupling in the supernet, a simple search space that consists of single path architectures is proposed.
 Throughout all experimental settings, DNC accuracy serves as a comparison baseline.
 They are classified as pre- and post-upsampling models (Wang et al., 2019) respectively, as the former takes Interpolated LR (ILR) images as input while the latter processes LR images directly.
 Show experimentally that OP-DMA routinely outperforms standard distribution-mapping autoencoders for outlier detection on a variety of real-world benchmark datasets
 Besides, we further visualize and explain the searched functions, which can also help design better rules to control memorization effects in the future.
 The experimental results on FFHQ and LSUN datasets show the LIA achieves superior performance on inference and generation.
 This makes the restricted condition number κŝ of SBCD-HTP smaller than other algorithms.
 We remark that CPGAN is orthogonal to other techniques such as spectral normalization Miyato et al., (2018), thus we only compare with vanilla methods such as WGAN-GP.
 Our algorithm shows consistent superiority over the existing state-of-the-art DRL method (Khalil et al., 2017) both in terms of speed and quality of the solution, and can compete with the existing MIS solver (ReduMIS, Lamm et al., 2017) under a similar time budget.
 The convergence rate of vanilla SGD with sparse communication has been proved in (Alistarh et al., 2018; Stich et al., 2018; Karimireddy et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2019).
 For ease of reading, we adopt the notation from the textbook by Goodfellow et al., (2016).
We describe the noise dominated and curvature dominated regimes of SGD with and without Momentum in section 2.
 As an efficient alternative, DeepXML achieved state-of-the-art accuracies by fine tuning only the residual connection based document representation for tail labels.

The main contributions of this work are as follows:
We train this representational model on image pairs where in each pair, the second image is a deformed version of the first image, and the deformation is known.
But how do we know which interactions to allow and which to forbid? This is a domain-specific modeling question.
 In particular, we provide a new efficient implementation for these schemes using a modern computational framework (Pytorch), and benchmark it on classic large-scale image classification tasks.
CONTRIBUTIONS
 At last, we summarize the contribution of this work as follows:
 In these cases, we compare our algorithm with others in different settings.
 One realization of this idea is the recently proposed competitive gradient descent (CGD) algorithm (Schäfer & Anandkumar, 2019), where players update their parameters using the Nash equilibrium of local approximations of the loss functions that takes into account actions of the other player.
 The gradients are not approximated, they can be computed exactly even at the object boundaries and in the presence of self-occlusions.
 This distribution of data replayed to the network in this work follows similar natural assumptions.
 In Section 2, we give a rigorous proof that NNE with a single hidden layer succeeds in learning arbitrary linear target functions.
 Section 3 presents a noise-resistant AdaBoost algorithm.
 In Section 5, we present our experimental results, and conclude by indicating potential future directions of research.
 Besides, SELF remains robust towards the choice of the network architecture.
 To achieve this, we augment the loss function with a term that penalizes the weights if they are not +1 or -1:minimize x,a1m m∑ i=1 fi(x,yi) + µ 4 n∑ j=1 (aj(xj + 1) 2 + (1− aj)(xj − 1)2)subject to aj = 0 or 1, j = 1, . , n,where µ is a given penalty parameter.
 For an edge serving as a bridge of two clusters, its curvature is negative and it is hard for information to pass.
 However, compared with DPP, such measurements are unable to fully characterize diversity in an arbitrary bounded space.
 Further, linear quantization can be divided into symmetric mode and asymmetric mode.
 A UCC model can be trained to predict ucc labels of individual images in a fully supervised manner; and the trained model can be used to extract features of pixels (intances) inside the images (bags).
 Nazari et al., (2018) improve the Pointer Network with a new design, making the model invariant with respect to the input sequence, and extend it to solve VRP.
 The subscript k indicates that gk contains a total of k cascaded non-linear activation layers.
 However, for subset S+, a weak attack for the maximization tends to degenerate the robustness.
 In section 3, we discuss the non-acceleration of SGD+Nesterov.
 In addition, both qualitative and quantitative analyses confirm that our model generates high-quality attention for unseen classes.
 Moreover, even in benign settings, we believe adversarial policies can be a useful tool for uncovering unexpected policy failure modes.
 It also matches the lower bound in the dependence on , S and A up to logarithmic factors.
 The constructed mapping Q is exactly the quotient map.
Limitations.
 Visualising the predicted Q+-values shows that they are indeed optimistic for novel state-action pairs.
Our results establish GA as a superior gradient-penalizing option to SA and suggest that using GA is a preferable alternative to SSGD in non-dedicated networks such as cloud computing, even when scaling to large numbers of workers.
 GAIL is formulated as a minimax optimization problem.
 These approaches use the sign of the gradient (or its zero-order estimate) to achieve better convergence, whereas our approach both estimates and uses the sign of the gradient.
 Specif-ically, our proposed linear schedule is more simple, robust, and effective than prior approaches, for both budgeted and general training.
 We contribute the following insight:
Finally, we show that the scene understanding and navigation policies learned on PointGoalNav can be transferred to other tasks (Flee and Explore (Gordon et al., 2019)) – the analog of ‘ImageNet pre-training + task-specific fine-tuning’ for Embodied AI.
Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
 Our approach, therefore, is to design intervention experiments where we establish a baseline and compare it against variants designed to test some aspect or prediction of the theory.
 If, instead, the input transformation simply copies the inputs onto the first d compo-nents of the first hidden layer, and the output transformation takes the first k components of the last hidden layer, then our analysis does not provide a guarantee.
 Among them, sample selection based method is one promising direction that selects samples to reduce noisy ratio for training.
Our Contributions.
We summarize the contributions of this paper as follows
Contributions.
 Our approach potentially allows the network to learn a more abstract policy not directly tied to detailed decisions that are specific to particular graphs, which may generalize better to new graphs.
 We demonstrate promising results of our approach on unsupervised domain mapping.
 In particular, to deal with high-dimensional inputs, such as text, images and videos, score function estimation via Spectral Stein Gradient Estimator (SSGE) (Shi et al., 2018) is computationally expensive and complex.
In this work, we introduce co-attentive equivariant feature mappings and apply them on existing equivariant neural architectures.
 A significant attribute that differentiates AFD and AFS from their existing counterparts is that we employ attention mechanisms to adaptively learn to “turn the valves” dynamically with small trainable auxiliary networks.
 We hope our empirical analysis can bring some insights to the future designs of NAS algorithms.
 These observations are also supported by the flat minimum analysis (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Wu et al., 2017; Langford & Caruana, 2002), that is, the product of the eigenvalues of the Hessian around the SGD solution tends to be small, which means SGD converges to a flat minimum and possess stability against small perturbations leading to good generalization.
 Specifically, it has been observed by Shallue et al., (2018) that the optimal learning rate scales differently with the batch size when changing the models and datasets, i.g,, there is no general "rule of thumb" that applies in all cases.
 Also, we design a bi-level aggregator operating on the structural neighborhoods to update the feature representations of nodes in graph neural networks, which are able to guarantee permutation invariance for graph-structured data.
 Therefore, we call our model E2Efold.
 For example, due to the large number of prediction-networks in this design, only simple functions - often just matrices - are used to model part-whole relationships.
 Therefore, rescaling the gradient magnitude equals to adjusting the weights of examples; 2) A specific loss function owns a fixed gradient derivation.
 So we modify the hypothesis as the topology with dense and effective connections are necessary for networks that are compatible with the optimization process.
 Among existing works, Hochreiter et al., (2001) propose a system allowing the output of backpropagation from one network to feed into an additional learning network, with both networks trained jointly; Based on this, Andrychowicz et al., (2016) further show that the design of an optimization algorithm can be cast as a learning problem.
 From this, most of the previously proposed gradient estimators can be naturally derived in a principled manner.
 The new DLAM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a critical point.
 We overcome this difficulty by using a decomposable lower bound of the entropy (Ranganath et al., 2016; Louizos & Welling, 2017).
 In this framework, the hidden variables of RNN are interpreted as statistics of the observation history.

 On the basis of ensuring the large receptive field, more details of the spatial structure are retained.
 Leveraging more advanced architectures (see Figures 1 and 2) motivated by observant analysis as emphasized, our design not only addresses such a scalability issue by design, but also outperforms the single-layer neural network.
 We also define xt(k) = x− xh(k).
 This not only helps us establish approximate incentive-compatibility, but also enables the designer to recover the targeted distribution from elicited samples.
 Our result theoretically justifies the advantage of gradient perturbation and close the mismatch.
 The denoising autoencoder has been previously used in unsupervised machine translation (Lample et al., 2017) and sentence compression (Févry & Phang, 2018), and we employ it to help the model extract salient information from corrupted text.
 Thereby, we recover Hessian based quantities as measures of flatness.
Lastly, we contribute to the MARL literature by providing an important and concrete real-world application of methods that to date have found limited practical application.
 It might thus be possible to exploit the co-occurrence of organisms to gain better accuracy (Carbonneau et al., 2018).
 For a given input x(0) with the true label y and the attack target t (t ≠ y), let p∗cert denote the exact robustness certificate, i.g,the distance of x(0) to the decision boundary.
 Second, we conduct perhaps the largest study in the literature to understand DNN training across a wide variety of noise levels and types, architectures, methods, and training settings.
 In addition, TPO narrows down the number of tree expansion (actions) compared to discretization techniques such as Tang et al., 45 which requires 7-11 bins per action dimension.
We focus on two domains, specifically for classification: patents and scientific papers.
 In incremental/continual learning works, often the amount of data used to retrain the network is small compared to the original dataset while in LILAC we fully use the entire dataset, distinguished by Seen and Unseen labels.
 Furthermore, numerical results show that CQL greatly outperforms other methods when the scale of the problem increases.
 In particular, on CIFAR10, we achieve 91.51% natural test accuracy and 57.23% robust test accuracy against `∞ PGD attacks constrained to = 8/255.

 The training is hyperparameter-free and easy to converge.
 Specifically, we change the setting of distributions and show the controllers can guide the scores towards varying preset distributions.
 We observe significant advantages for multigrid memory, including:• Long-term large-capacity retention.
 By adopting CNN architectures, Optimization Issue and Memory Issue would be mitigated to some extent.
 To train the initial neural surrogate model, meta-learning methods such as MAML (Finn et al., 2017) are not applicable because Bayesian optimization is non-differentiable.
 It is compatible with any network structures (i.g,, networkagnostic) and is as simple as training an independent network.
 In each case, GAN-TSC improves over student training without TSC, over TSC without synthetic data augmentation, and over the tabular data augmentation strategy of Bucila et al., (2006).
 Experimental results show that our proposed variants of DRO framework outperform state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets.
 Moreover, the statistical error of our algorithms is also smaller than that of SG-HT (i.g,, 1n ∑n i=1‖∇fi(w∗)‖) due to the large magnitude of ‖∇fi(w∗)‖ (Zhou et al., 2018b).
 For example, AutoDP even outperforms ReduMIS in the Barabási-Albert graph with two million vertices using a smaller amount of time.
 Very recently, there has appeared one sparse communication method for distributed MSGD (DMSGD), called deep gradient compression (DGC) (Lin et al., 2018), which has achieved better performance than vanilla DSGD with sparse communication in practice.
 We focus on the analogy between SGD and stochastic differential equations (Gardiner et al., 1985; Welling & Teh, 2011; Mandt et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017), but our primary contributions are empirical and many of our conclusions can be derived from different assumptions (Ma et al., 2017b; Zhang et al., 2019).
 A number of modifications were made to the highly scalable Slice classifier (Jain et al., 2019) for pre-trained embeddings to allow it to also train the tail residual connection without sacrificing scalability.
 Our contributions are the following:
 Therefore, it makes sense to model the only the most significant few bits while attempting to decode pixels for representation learning.
 Instead, reconstruction error is widely used as an anomaly score function (An & Cho, 2015).
 After encoding, an RNN decoder is used to characterize the sequence information of the selected stations.
 Experiment is conducted for CIFRA10 and ImageNet subset considering different types of noise, including Gaussian, Wald, Poisson, Salt&Paper, and adversarial noise demonstrating robust classification under input noise.
 We learn the encoding matrices for vector representation and the matrices that represent the pixel displacements from the training data.
 In general, we would like to exploit the observation that events are structured objects with participants (which is why the number of possible event types is often large).
The intuition behind the nonuniform quantization scheme underlying NUQSGD is that, after L2 normalization, many elements of the normalized stochastic gradient will be near-zero.
 And the result further verifies the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed methods.
 The key lesson is to regularize the policy network but not the value network.
 This also allows for efficient memory storage as only a fraction of data for the previous tasks needs to be stored.
 In Section 3, we discuss experiments with NNE and DNN on MNIST.
 Our Boosting via Self Labelling framework is introduced in Section 4.
 Our work is transferable to other tasks without the need to modify the architecture or the primary learning objective.
 Specifically, on the one hand, our CIE module can effectively boost the accuracy by exploring the edge attributes which otherwise are not considered in state-of-the-art deep graph matching methods; on the other hand, our Hungarian attention mechanism also shows generality and it is complementary to existing graph matching loss.
 The binary variable aj can be interpreted as a switch for weight xj : when aj = 0, (1− aj)(xj − 1)2 is activated, and there is a strong incentive for xj to be 1 (the analysis for aj = 1 is similar).
 Asymmetric quantization has one more parameter (e.g, zero-point (Krishnamoorthi, 2018)) than symmetric quantization, and it requires additional subtraction or linearoperation before multiplication.
 Then, semantic segmentation masks can be obtained by unsupervised clustering of the pixels (each is represented by the extracted features) into two clusters (metastases or normal).
 Kool et al., (2019) propose a model based on attention layers, and an RL algorithm to train this model with a simple but effective baseline.
 x̂A = gk(xB) represents components, which are disentangled from the feature xA of the DNN A and can be reconstructed by the DNN B’s feature xB .
 Secondly, we test different minimization techniques with the inner maximization still solved by PGD10.
 In section 4 we introduce MaSS and analyze its convergence and optimal hyper-parameter selection.
 This result coincides with the property of mode connectivity that the minima found by gradient-based methods are connected by a path in the parameter space with almost invariant empirical risk (Garipov et al., 2018; Draxler et al., 2018; Kuditipudi et al., 2019).
 We note the following limitations of this work: First, our experiments are based on “plain” SGD in its simplest form, e.g, without momentum or other adjustments.
 To validate our claims, we performed experiments on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100 (Krizhevsky, 2012), ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015), and WikiText-103 (Merity et al., 2016) datasets, using several state-of-the-art architectures.
 Most of existing learning theories, however, focus on empirical risk minimization problems, and therefore are not readily applicable (Vapnik, 2013; Mohri et al., 2018; Anthony & Bartlett, 2009); 3).
Contributions.
 In Section 5, we apply our regularizer to WideResNet models (Zagoruyko and Komodakis, 2016) trained on the CIFAR datasets and demonstrate improved generalization performance for both clean and adversarially robust classification.
 As part of these experiments, we replicate the observations (a)\\u2013(c) in the literature noted above, and analyze the corresponding explanations provided by Coherent Gradients (\\u00a72), and outline for future work how (d)\\u2013(f) may be accounted for (\\u00a75).
 It exhibits fast training time, has fewer parameters and better accuracy relative to standard LSTMs.
 There is a good reason for this: a slight modification of a lower bound argument from Bartlett et al., (2019) demonstrates that GD may fail to converge in this case.
 These methods are based on the idea of curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009) which is one successful method that trains the model gradually with samples ordered in a meaningful sequence.
 Our contributions are twofold.
 We make our implementation and datasets available online at github.
 Our main contributions can thus be summarized as follows:

Our main contributions are as follows:
 Based on these observations, we make use of the eigenvalue decay of the weight matrix and the covariance matrix among the nodes in each layer (this assumption is actually verified by numerical experiments in Appendix D).
A similar scaling rule for the learning rate was proposed before (Zhang et al., 2015), however, there it lacked a theoretical basis or a demonstration of its effectiveness with large effective batch sizes, i.g,, the sum of all the minibatch sizes of all the workers, as we do here.
 Compared with exist-ing MPNNs, the scheme extracts more structural information of the graph and can aggregate feature representations from distant nodes via mapping them to neighborhoods defined in the latent space.
 To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to theoretically demonstrate1In original paper (McMahan et al., 2017), E epochs of SGD are performed in parallel.
By using an unrolled algorithm as the inductive bias to design Post-Processing Network, the output space of E2Efold is constrained (illustrated in Fig 3), which makes it easier to learn a good model in the case of limited data and also reduces the overfitting issue.
 While building deep capsule networks, such a linear inductive bias can be inaccurate in layers where complex objects are represented.
 Adjusting the gradient can be treated as a more direct and flexible way of modifying optimisation objectives; 3) Instead of focusing on harder examples2 by default, we can adjust emphasis focus to relative easier ones when noise is severe.
 Regardless of the node types, the optimal structure is always a subset of the complete graph.
 Specifically, they use long short-term memory RNNs to model the algorithm and allow the RNNs to exploit structure in the problems of interest in an automatic way, which is undoubtedly one of the most popular methods for learning-to-learn.
 Due to the tightness of our proposed expected bounds, we show that with a simple standard training procedure, large/deep networks can be robustly trained on both MNIST (LeCun, 1998) and CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009) achieving state-of-art robustness-accuracy trade-off compared to IBP.

The main contributions of our work are:
 In the first, we use single unit cells, as shown in fig.
 We show all components are necessary to achieve the best performance.
 To that end we rely on architectural choices and normalization techniques from the style transfer literature (Huang & Belongie, 2017) 2.
 The other advantage is that the network greatly reduces the number of parameters and the difficulties of network training and deployment.
 The merits of our design are evaluated against the single-layer neural network and other state-of-the-art algorithms through extensive experiments on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets (see Section 5).
 If x = x1, x2T ∈ C2n with x1, x2 ∈ Cn, and if x1 is k-sparse and x2 is t-sparse, then x is called (k, t)-sparse.
Our main contributions are:
 We can efficiently compute d∗cert such that d∗cert ≥ p∗cert.
 We hope our benchmark along with our findings, resulted from a considerable amount of manual labeling effort (∼520K annotations) and computing resources (∼3K experiments), will facilitate future deep learning research on real-world noisy data.

 Bloom filters are commonly used in networks where such increased adversarial false positive rate can hurt the performance.
 Additionally, we also introduce an embedding distillation method, which is similar to Knowledge Distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) but we apply it to distill knowledge from a pre-trained embedding matrix and use an L2 loss instead of cross-entropy loss.
 These results suggest that practitioners should pick up adaptive gradient methods once again for faster training of deep neural networks.
This work makes the following contributions.
 Besides, we perform an ablation study by adding constraints back to analyze their effect on masks.
 On spatial mapping tasks, our architecture retains large, long-term memory.
 For Multi-Scale Issue, with the help of the recently introduced scale augmentation (Kim et al., 2016a;b) or scale-specific multi-path learning (Lim et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019) strategies, both of our models are capable of handling multi-scale SR problem effectively, and achieve favorable performance against state-of-the-arts, as shown in fig. 1.
 Thus we propose a weighted Reptile algorithm inspired by Reptile algorithm (Nichol et al., 2018) using sampling strategy for exploration to train the initial neural surrogate model.
 We observe that this aligned permutation is close to a locally optimal permutation that PAM converges to under the same initialization.
 It demonstrates both of these language GANs fail.
 Furthermore, we also show that our fully learning-based scheme generalizes well even to graph types unseen during training and works well even for other variants of the MIS problem: the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem and the prize collecting maximum independent set (PCMIS) problem (see Appendix B).
 However, the theory about the convergence of DGC is still lack.
 In section 3, we provide an empirical study of the relationship between the optimal learning rate and the batch size under a constant epoch budget, which verifies the existence of the two regimes in practice.
 Finally, instead of learning an expensive ensemble of base classifiers to increase accuracy (Prabhu et al., 2018b; You et al., 2018), DeepXML improved performance by re-ranking the set of predicted labels to eliminate the hardest negatives for the base classifier with only a 10% increase in training time.
 Higher order bits are more relevant for texture and finer-details and may not be crucial for representation learning performance.
As a variant of variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2014), β-VAE (Higgins et al., 2017) is designed for unsupervised discovery of interpretable factorized latent representations from raw image data.
 Moreover, we employ an attention layer to produce the probability distribution over feasible candidate stations.
 Unlike training-based approaches, SAFE-DNN shows improved accuracy for a wide range of noise structure and magnitude without requiring any prior knowledge of the perturbation during training and inference and does not degrade the accuracy for clean images (even shows marginal improvement in many cases).
 For example, a travel event involves both a person and a place.
 By concentrating quantization levels near zero, we are able to establish stronger bounds on the excess variance.
 This opens a new avenue to deal with high-dimensional categorical features.
 These ambiguities might derail the training to undesirable results.
The classification performance of the proposed training regime is evaluated on the CIFAR-100 dataset for two phases.

 Interestingly, we find that different minimization techniques on misclassified examples make a significant difference to the final robustness.
 In section 5, we analyze the mini-batch MaSS.
 Additionally, this property suggests that we would need to study every local minimum valley as a whole.
 While our framework may in principle be used with any first-order optimization scheme, we have chosen to refrain from using more commonly used methods, such as Adam Kingma & Ba (2014) in order to reduce the number of hyper-parameters and allow for a clearer differentiation between different policies.
 A version of GA has reached 72.18% final test accuracy on the ImageNet dataset using 128 simulated asynchronous workers.
 The minimax optimization problem in (1) does not have a convex-concave structure, and therefore existing theories in convex optimization literature cannot be applied for analyzing the alternating stochastic gradient-type algorithms (Willem, 1997; Ben-Tal & Nemirovski, 1998; Murray & Overton, 1980; Chambolle & Pock, 2011; Chen et al., 2014).

 This observation helped us to develop a simple multi-step gradient ascent descent algorithm for fair inference and guarantee its theoretical convergence to first-order stationarity.
 The node-specific proposal distribution choices provide a rich set of knobs for the network to flexibly direct the search.
 To this end, we derive a new reparameterization trick for the representation distribution based on the lower-variance reparameterization trick proposed by Roeder et al., (2017).
 It is critical not to disrupt equivariance in the attention procedure as to preserve it across the entire network.

 Yet, the constraints encoded in E2Efold are flexible enough such that pseudoknots are not excluded.
 Thus, for the purpose of building deeper architectures, as well as more expressive layers, this inefficiency in the prediction phase must be handled.
 GR serves as emphasis regularisation and is different from standard regularisers, e.g, L2 weight decay constraints on weight parameters and Dropout samples neural units randomly (Srivastava et al., 2014);GR is simple yet effective.
 Naturally, finding the optimal topology in a full search space is equivalent to finding the optimal sub-graph in the complete graph.
However, there are two major drawbacks of the existing L2L methods: (1) It requires a large amount of datasets (or a large number of tasks in multi-task learning) to guarantee the learned optimizer to generalize, which significantly limits their applicability (most of the related works only consider the image encoding as the motivating application); (2) The number of layers/iterations in RNNs for modeling algorithms cannot be large to avoid significant computational burden in backpropagation.
 In other words, we can consistently improve robustness by significant margins with minimal effect on test accuracy as compared to IBP.

In this way, the most strict consistency is the 0-order consistency, i.g,x̂A = g0(xB) can be reconstructed from xB via a linear transformation.
 As shown in Figure 1(c), compared with standard adversarial training (dashed blue line) with the CE loss, the final robustness is significantly improved when the outer minimization on misclassified examples is “regularized” (solid green line) by an additional term (a KL-divergence term that was used previously in Zheng et al., (2016); Zhang et al., (2019)).
 In Section 6, we show experimental results.
 In particular, the analysis techniques developed in (Jin et al., 2018) do not directly apply here.
• Linear collapse.
Second, due to resource constraints, we have not applied our approach to the training of very demanding models, such as deep Convolutional Neural Networks Krizhevsky et al., (2012) or transformer-based models like BERT Devlin et al., (2018), which are now considered the “state of the art” in Computer Vision and NLP, respectively.

 iRNNs/SiRNNs are robust to time-series distortions such as noise paddings.
 The resulting condition on the network width is weaker than that for Gaussian random transformations, and thus improves on the corresponding convergence guarantee for linear networks, which, in addition to requiring wider networks, only hold with high probability for random transformations.
To efficiently minimize the 0-1 loss while keeping the robust properties, we propose a novel loss that is a tighter upper bound of the 0-1 loss compared with conventional surrogate losses.
 We then show that algorithm-wise, the fixed-point type MSP algorithm for `4-norm maximization has the same nature as the classic power-iteration method for PCA (Jolliffe, 2011) and the FastICA algorithm for ICA (Hyvärinen & Oja, 1997).
 Combining learning with a search algorithm has been shown to be successful (e.g, (Silver et al., 2017; 2018)), and our work can be seen as an instance of the same high-level idea.

 We demonstrate its effectiveness on diverse computer vision tasks using different net architectures: 1) Image classification with clean training data; 2) Image classification with synthetic symmetric label noise, which is more challenging than asymmetric noise evaluated by (Vahdat, 2017; Ma et al., 2018); 3) Image classification with real-world unknown anomalies, which may contain open-set noise (Wang et al., 2018), e.g, images with only background, or outliers, etc.; 4) Video person re-identification, a video retrieval task containing diverse anomalies.
To focus on the optimization of topology itself, in this work, we exclude the influence of the mixture of different layers/nodes and select the complete DAG as the search space.
 With these techniques, LAIN still decomposes the inference task into subtasks, so amortized inference can apply.
 That is to say, RNN estimator’s asymptotic estimation error can be as close to minimum mean square error as desired.
 InfoCNF also achieves a slightly better negative log-likelihood (NLL) score than the baseline in large-batch training, but attains a slightly worse NLL score in small-batch training.
 Most of previous works only use a single input such as the word or use the multi-input model in certain subdomains like user sentiment analysis (Amplayo et al., (2018)).
 In unsupervised learning of ill-posed problems regularization is crucial.
Our contributions.
 Additionally, in the unsupervised setting, when the labels c are not available, (C → Y ) can be realized by β-VAE, a regularized version of VAE which has been shown to learn a disentangled representation of its latent variables (Higgins et al., 2017; Burgess et al., 2018).
 Compared with the reference network, the number of parameters is reduced by 42%, and the matching accuracy is improved by 1.9%.
 We investigate four models.
 The experimental results show that TED outperform all unsupervised abstractive baselines on all datasets.
 Using our algorithm we can also solve the full version of the convex program presented in Davis et al., (2007) instead of a heuristic approximation.
We have similar results for the attack problem.
3. Infrastructure and results.
 The experimental results demonstrate our method can surpass traditional SR models.
 Scientific papers are another significant area of investigation.
 Although the original formulation of negative mining was based on imbalanced data, recent object detection works have highlighted its importance in contrasting and improving learning in neural networks.
Motivation: For a binary classifier, the density of score distribution, f(s(x)) shows a different trend for elements in the set and outside the set S.
 Visualizing internal memory unit activations actually reveals the representation and algorithmic strategy our network learns in order to solve the problem.
 These experiments show that our method outperforms traditional Gaussian process and related warm-starting methods in these tasks.
 Since both our algorithms have a significantly lower hard thresholding complexity, they are more suitable for handling large-scale sparse representation learning problems, especially for high-dimensional data.
 Hence it is a local momentum without global information.
 Finally in section 5, we fix the batch size and consider the relationship between the optimal learning rate and the epoch budget.
 Furthermore, XML-CNN and AttentionXML were unable to scale to a proprietary dataset for matching queries to bid phrases containing 3 million labels and 21 million training points on which DeepXML trained in 14 hours on a single GPU.
 This is achieved by applying a time dependant regularization to the model’s loss.
 The adoption of self-attention for images began with (Wang et al., 2018) who used non-local layers for activity recognition.
 It was demonstrated that βVAE with appropriately tuned value of β (when β > 1) qualitatively outperforms VAE (when β = 1, β-VAE is exactly VAE).
 The reward function takes the final output station sequence as input only, which is friendly to objective changing.
 However, unlike de-noising networks, the SAFE-DNN has negligible computation and memory overhead, and does not introduce new stages in the processing pipeline.
 Given that modeling assumption, parameter estimation cannot try to derive this probability (presumably incorrectly) from the state of the coal market.
 Combined with a bound on the expected code-length, we obtain a bound on the total communication costs of achieving an expected suboptimality gap.
 They are composable in the sense that they can be modified to reflect different class membership or contextual information.
 It overcomes the disadvantages of using either approach independently while inheriting the complementary advantages of both approaches.
 Recall that when combined with a Lipschitz constraint, WGAN minimizes the Wasserstein distance between generator and target distribution.
Section 2 of the paper briefly presents the proposed training regime along with the SHDL network.
 All missing details can be found in Appendix.
 (3)If µ is properly selected (or sufficiently large), the optimal aj will be exactly or close to 0 or 1.
 Our synthetic graphs are generated according to various well-established graph models, e.g, stochastic block model (Decelle et al., 2011), Watts–Strogatz network (Watts & Strogatz, 1998), Newman–Watts network (Newman & Watts, 1999) and Kleinberg’s navigable small world graph (Kleinberg, 2000).
 For instance, the object detection model Redmon et al., (2016) typically uses Leaky ReLU.
Finally, we have constructed ucc classifiers and experimentally shown that clustering performance of our framework with our ucc classifiers is better than the performance of unsupervised models and comparable to performance of fully supervised learning models.
 Given an initial solution, their goal is to find a sequence of steps towards the solution with minimal cost.
 In comparison, some neural activations in the 1-order consistent feature x̂A = g1(xB) are not directly represented by xB and need to be predicted via a non-linear transformation.
 The same regularization applied to correctly classified examples also helps the final robustness (solid orange line), though not as significantly as for misclassified examples.
 We refer the readers to Section 3.2 for detailed explanations and a concrete example.
 Linear neural networks are covered by our theories as a simplified case.
 We leave experiments on this scale for future work.
 More specifically, at every iteration, they need to solve the inner maximization problem up to a high precision, and then apply stochastic gradient update to the outer minimization problem.
 Specifically, giving any base loss function l(u) ≥ 1 ( u < 0 ) , u ∈ R, our loss Q(u) satisfies∑ni=1 1 ( ui < 0 ) ≤ Q(u) ≤ ∑n i=1 l(ui), where u = u1, · · · , un with ui being the classification margin of ith sample, and 1(·) is an indicator function.
 This interpretation gives a unified view for problems that pursue principal, independent, or sparse components from high-dimensional data and enriches our understanding of low-dimensional structure recovery frameworks, classical and new, at both formulation and algorithmic fronts.
 For K-means clustering problem, we show that sufficientlylarge regularization coefficient yields perfect fairness under disparate impact doctrine.
This paper makes several contributions:
Experiments and results.
 We choose different embedding methods to map the graph to a suitable latent space for different applications, where suitable topology patterns of graph are preserved.
 More precisely, the data distributions in the k-th and l-th devices, denote Dk and Dl, can be different.
 Horizontally, although trained with easy properties, the learned GNN gives similar performance on medium and difficult level properties.
 This is the lack, in general, of theoretical guarantees on equivariance.
 Beyond, we show that GR is notably better than other standard regularisers, e.g, L2 weight decay and dropout.
 Through assigning learnable weights which reflect the importance of connections of edges, the topology can be optimizedthrough gradient descent.
 This indicates that the breakdown of RWS observed in Tucker et al., (2019) may not be due to its lack of a joint objective as previously conjectured (since IWAE-STL avoided this breakdown despite having the same idealised objective as RWS).
 It is worthing noting that subtasks in LAIN are generated from the same mechanism while those in AIGP are not.
 As an interesting special case, the widely used Kalman Filter can be synthesized by RNN.
In order to better understand the impact of the gating approach to learn the error tolerances, we compare InfoCNF with and without the gating networks.
 Choosing the right regularizer and the ability to incorporate it in the formulation is of prime importance.
 2 (and fig.
 We summarize our main contributions below.
 In Section 3 we provide implementation details for both the supervised and unsupervised versions.
 The main contributions of this paper are as follows.
 Three consider various extensions of the Bradley-Terry-Luce model (Bradley & Terry, 1952) to the group comparison scenario.
 For example, on the CNN/DM dataset, it outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised abstractive model by more than 9 ROUGE-1 points and compares favorably with most unsupervised extractive models.
 Thus, demonstrating that we can solve larger instances of the problem.
 For simplicity, we summarize definitions of p∗cert, d ∗ cert, p ∗ attack, d ∗ attack in Table 1.
 Many papers are uploaded to the internet every day, and their automatic categorization is becoming a necessity.
To summarize, our main contributions in LILAC are as follows,
 We observe that for keys, f(s(x)|x ∈ S) shows ascending trend as s(x) increases while f(s(x)|x /∈ S) has an opposite trend.
 The DNC, in contrast, fails to master this category of task.
 The experimental results on popular transfer learning datasets also demonstrate the generalization ability of the learned representations of our model.
In this paper, we propose a novel method, called global momentum compression (GMC), for sparse communication in DMSGD which includes DSGD as a special case.
 On this dataset, DeepXML was found to be at least 19 percentage points more accurate than Slice, Parabel (Prabhu et al., 2018b), and other leading query bid phrase-matching techniques currently running in production.
 We explain then how to use this model for CPD.
 (Zhang et al., 2018) and (Brock et al., 2018) exploit non-local layers for high-fidelity image generation.
 Burgess et al., (2018) proposed a modification to the training regime of βVAE by progressively increasing the information capacity of the latent code during training.
 Therefore, our model is general for different objectives.
 Hence, SAFE-DNN is an attractive architecture for resource-constrained autonomous platforms with real-time processing.
These kinds of systematic dependencies can be elegantly written down using Datalog rules, as we will show.
 The resulting bound is slightly stronger than the one provided by QSGD.
 Similar inputs lay near each other in the representation space.
 By analogy, the combination of WGAN loss with CGD can be interpreted as minimizing an integral probability metric (Sriperumbudur et al., 2009) based on ICR.
 Section 3 presents the experimental results while Section 4 draws conclusions.
 On these data, CurvGN outperforms vanilla graph network and networks using node degree information and self attention, demonstrating the benefit of curvature information in graph convolution.
 And the bottleneck of ResNet block does not use any activation function.
 We have also tested the performance of our model on the real world task of semantic segmentation of breast cancer metastases in lymph node sections.
 The smaller k indicates the less prediction involved in the reconstruction and the stricter consistency.
Motivated by the above observations, we reformulate the adversarial risk to incorporate an explicit differentiation of misclassified examples in a form of regularization.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
 When all activations are linear, the partitioned loss surface collapses to one single cell, in which all local minima are globally optimal, as suggested by the existing works on linear networks (Kawaguchi, 2016; Baldi & Hornik, 1989; Lu & Kawaguchi, 2017; Freeman & Bruna, 2017; Zhou & Liang, 2018; Laurent & von Brecht, 2018; Yun et al., 2018).
Despite the above limitations, we argue that our results clearly indicate the applicability of our approach in practice.
 Such algorithms, however, are rarely used by practitioners, as they are inefficient in practice (due to the computationally intensive inner maximization).
 We name it as Curriculum Loss (CL) because our loss automatically and adaptively selects samples for training, which can be deemed as a curriculum learning paradigm.
 For each home, data was collected for 2 to 4 months.
 Large batches trained by post-local SGD enjoy improved communication efficiency, while at the same time strongly outperforming most competing small and large batch baselines in terms of accuracy.
 Compared with MINE and MINE-f , MIGE provides a tighter and smoother gradient estimation of MI in a highdimensional and large-MI setting, as shown in Figure 1 of Section 4.
 We explore the effects of co-attentive equivariant feature mappings for single and multiple symmetry groups.
 The bound can convert several existing compression based bounds to that for non-compressed one in a unifying manner.
 Finally, we empirically validate and analyze Geom-GCN on a wide range of open datasets of graphs, and Geom-GCN achieved the state-of-the-art results.
3Throughout this paper, “sampling” refers to how the server chooses K user devices and use their outputs for updating the model parameters.
 More importantly, vertically, given that all other parts of BaB algorithms remain the same, the GNN trained on small networks performs well on large networks.
 Most capsule networks only use intuitive heuristics to learn transformation-robust spatial relations among components.
 Besides, to comprehensively understand GR’s behaviours, we present extensive ablation studies.
 Then task-related architectures can be achieved conveniently.
 Our work also provides a theoretical foundation for IWAE-STL which was hitherto only heuristically justified as a biased IWAE-gradient.
 We argue that subtasks sharing the same “distribution” are more appropriate for amortization.
 The consideration of asymptotic error differentiates us from existing work on expressive power of RNN (Schäfer & Zimmermann (2006)).
 In small-batch training, InfoCNF with gating networks achieves similar classification and density estimation performance as the same model without the gating networks, but reduces the NFEs by more than 21%.
 It is deeper than most of present models.
 Our formalism integrates such regularizations in a natural way.
We summarize our two main contributions:2Indeed the mapping from Y to X conditioned on Z can be viewed as a general form of style transfer.
 The other is a generalized version of the Thurstone model (Herbrich et al., 2007) widely used in skill rating systems of online games.
In the rest of this paper, we give an overview of previous related work in Section 2, describe our data generation method and machine learning models in Section 3 and analyse the results of our experiments in Section 4.
In summary, in this paper, we make the following contributions:
 The policy optimization is done on a TPU-v2 using multiple cores, and MCTS search is performed on a rack of CPU nodes.
 A statistics paper, for example, may not be categorized as machine learning by its authors, but could be of interest to the machine learning community.
 To reduce the overall FPR, we need lower FPRs for groups with a high f(s(x)|x /∈ S).
• Generality.
 Two models, CRNet-A and CRNet-B, inspired by this framework are proposed for image SR.
 Actually, the gradient oracle complexity of S2BCD-HTP is better than SBCD-HTP when we deal with sparse data sets, since S2BCD-HTP only evaluates the common nonzero point of the random sample and the sampled block.
 The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
Contributions: This paper makes the following contributions:
 (Razavi et al., 2019) has also shown that self-attention can be used to good effect for modeling distribution of latents for likelihood-based image generation while (Parmar et al., 2018; Menick & Kalchbrenner, 2018; Child et al., 2019) are examples for self-attentive density models.
 This modification facilitates the robust learning of disentangled representations in β-VAE, without the previous trade-off in the reconstruction accuracy.
 Without expert knowledge, the learning procedure drives the policy to keep track of the better solution during the search and to search for better solutions.
We note that, SAFE-DNN differs from deep SNNs that convert a pre-trained DNN to SNN (Sengupta et al., (2019), Hu et al., (2018)).
In terms of biological interpretation, the vectors can be interpreted as activities of groups of neurons, and the matrices can be interpreted as synaptic connections.
 Datalog rules can refer to database facts, such as the fact that Alice is a person and that she is related to other people.
To study how quantization affects convergence on state-of-the-art deep models, we compare NUQSGD, QSGD, and QSGDinf, focusing on training loss, variance, and test accuracy on standard deep models and large datasets.
 Thus, its superior performance supports the claim that ICR is the appropriate form of regularization for GANs.
 Such benefit is more apparent as the graph size increases.
 The quantization methods are expected to be adapted to these situations.
 We have compared the performance of our model with the performance of popular medical image segmentation architecture of Unet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) and shown that our weakly supervised model approximates the performance of fully supervised Unet model1.
 Note that the number of non-linear operations k is just a rough approximation of the difficulty of prediction, since there are no standard methods to quantify prediction difficulties.
 We then propose a new defense algorithm to achieve this in a dynamic way during adversarial training.
 After introducing the notation used in the paper in Section 2, we describe our infinite Q-learning with UCB algorithm in Section 3.
Notations.
 In our experiments, we were not only able to demonstrate the mere existence of optimal synchronization policies for an individual pair of underlying model and training data, but also show that learned policies are able to provide significant speedups, even when applied to training slightly different models on different training datasets and different cluster environments.
Our contributions are listed as follows:
 We show that, similar to PCA, `4-norm maximization and the MSP algorithm are inherently stable to small noise.
 Ground truth measurements are provided via smart plugs connected directly to each appliance.
 Specifically, we replace conventional rotation equivariant mappings in p4-CNNs (Cohen & Welling, 2016) and DRENs (Li et al., 2018) with co-attentive ones.
 The bound is applied to near low rank models as concrete examples.
In summary, the contribution of this paper is three-fold:
 “Sampling” does not mean how a device randomly selects training samples.
 Since the network size determines the total cost for generating training data and is positively correlated with the difficulty of learning, this vertical transferability allows our framework to be readily applicable to large scale problems.
 This is acceptable, but not ideal.
Main contribution.
 Besides, this optimization method is also compatible with existing networks.
Our work is also related to GAN and dual-embedding (Dai et al., 2016).
Our empirical evaluations show that the LAIN method outperforms baseline methods including AIGP in several learning tasks.
 When trained with large batches, gating networks help attain a reduction of 5% in test error and a small improvement in NLLs.
 Compared with shallow and straightforward models, our model can extract more global or long-term features, and have fewer parameters.
 We demonstrate our algorithm by a second order elliptic equation, in particular the Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) application on a circular and three other arbitrary domains.
 This is a method for featurizing neural architectures by enumerating paths along the DAG from the input node to the output node.
 This network can improve the stereo matching accuracy with fewer parameters.
 As a result, we show that our framework consistently yields the best performances across all of these datasets (nearbest in some cases), while the other state-of-the-art algorithms suffer from inconsistent performances across different models.
 Additionally, we show that the optimality error (L2 distance of the current iterate to the optimal) asymptotically decays at an exponential rate.
 An overview of our proposed architectures is depicted in Figure 1.
 A synchronous policy update and data collection approach is used to train the policy and generate trajectories.
 Additionally, Tshitoyan et al., (2019) show material science concepts can be learned from scientific papers by a language model.
 Hence, if we are tuning the number of hash functions differently, more hash functions are required for the corresponding groups.
 On tasks decoupled from any notion of spatial geometry, such as associative recall or sorting, our memory networks prove equally as capable as DNCs.
 Furthermore, their gradient oracle complexities are significantly lower than those of ASBCDHT and SVRG-HT, and much lower than that of FG-HT, since they require a smaller sparsity level s= Ω(κŝs∗) and also have a smaller value of κŝ with ŝ= 2s+s∗ compared with the restricted condition number κs̃ used in other hard thresholding algorithms (Zhou et al., 2018b).
 This benchmark exhibits how ATR-CSPD manages to detect new types of change points, undetected by regular algorithms.
 Learning spatial dependencies across patches: CPC learns to spatially predict neighboring patches given context of surrounding patches.
 Hoffman et al., (2017) introduced a reformulation of β-VAE for 0 < β < 1.
 Its natural exploration mechanism determines that RL is suitable for large scale solution space.
 Such networks function as a spiking network during inference to reduce energy; however, the learning is still based on supervision and back-propagation.
 Given these facts, we use Datalog rules to automatically generate the set of possible events and node blocks, and the ways in which they influence one another.
 Using the same number of bits per iteration, experimental results show that NUQSGD has smaller variance than QSGD, as expected by our theoretical results.
 This allows efficient class-membership computation and easy manipulation in the representation space.
 We hypothesize that graph convolution alone can adapt to any graph topology, at the cost of more convolutional layers and more training data.
 However, Zhang et al., (2018a); Park et al., (2017) only focus on the quantization of activations after ReLU.
Hence, there are three main contributions of this paper:
 As shown in fig.  2, g is designed to disentangle and quantify consistent feature components of different orders between DNNs.
 Our main contributions are:
 We then state our main theoretical results, which are in the form of PAC sample complexity bounds.
 If M is a matrix, Mi,j denotes the (i, j)-th component of M .
 Specifically, our contributions can be summarized as follows:•We formally define the generalization of GAIL under the “so-called”R-reward distance, and then show that the generalization of GAIL can be guaranteed under reward distance as long as the class of the reward functions is properly controlled;•We provide sufficient conditions, under which an alternating mini-batch stochastic gradient algorithm can efficiently solve the minimax optimization in (1), and attains sublinear convergence to a stationary solution.
 Somewhat surprisingly though, unlike PCA, the MSP algorithm is further robust to outliers and resilient to sparse gross errors! We provide characterizations of these desirable properties of MSP.
 We show that co-attentive rotation equivariant neural networks consistently outperform their conventional counterparts in fully (rotated MNIST) and partially (CIFAR-10) rotational settings.
that FedAvg with certain schemes (see Table 1) can achieve O( 1T ) convergence rate in non-iid federated setting.
 A capsule network model that can detect compositionalities in a provablyinvariant manner are more useful, and more in line with the basic motivations for capsules.
 Given a basic network, optimization of topology can lead to improvement without additional computing burdens.
 Our derivation also makes it clear that the learning rate should be scaled as O(K) for the IWAE φ-gradient (and its modified version IWAE-DREG) unless the gradients are normalised as implicitly done by popular optimisers such as ADAM (Kingma & Ba, 2015).
 Our investigation also indicates that LAIN can achieve decent performance even only a few neighbors are considered.
 We also confirm the benefits of our gating approach on unconditional CNF and observe that on CIFAR10 learning the error tolerances helps reduce the NFEs by 15% while preserving the NLL.
 We additionally solve the inverse problem of diffusion and wave equations.
 When predicting the validation accuracy of neural networks, using this featurization drastically improves the performance compared to standard encodings such as the adjacency matrix encoding, making it feasible to use a meta neural network as a model in Bayesian optimization.
Using real-world datasets, we also demonstrate that our framework performs consistently well across diverse real-world applications.
 We also show that because of the FORGET step, when the algorithm terminates, the set of constraints that remain remembered are exactly the active constraints.
 In addition to the adversarial robustness problem, these bounds may be of an independent interest for readers.
 TPO readily extends to challenging and high-dimensional tasks, such the Humanoid benchmark 9.
 They demonstrated materials for functional applications could be recommended several years before their initial discovery.
 While for groups with a few non-keys, we allow higher FPRs.
 We perform an exhaustive comparison of current state-of-the-art models in this setting.
 Architecture search is efficient and flexible.
Section 4 further elaborates experimental results, while Section 5 summarizes implications.
 But different from DGC which adopts local momentum, GMC adopts global momentum.
 Image Transformers (Parmar et al., 2018) adopts self-attention that takes into account local as well as global dependencies behaving like a patch-based generative model.
 They argued that, within in this range, training β-VAE is equivalent to optimizing an approximate log-marginal likelihood bound of VAE under an implicit prior.
Based on real city-scale human mobility information of 24,770,715 mobile phone users obtained from a citywide 3G cellular network, we expand the current metro network in Xi’an, China.
 In contrast, SAFE-DNN hybridizes STDP and SGD during learning but creates a single hybrid network operating as a DNN during inference.
 Datalog makes it easy to give structured names to the events and node blocks.
 This smaller variance also translates to improved optimization performance, in terms of both training loss and test accuracy.

 Datalog makes it easy to give structured names to the events and node blocks.
 This smaller variance also translates to improved optimization performance, in terms of both training loss and test accuracy.
 This is corroborated by our experiments on real-world graphs.
 In this paper, we demonstrate our method is friendly to different activation methods such as Leaky ReLU.
 Our method can be applied to different types of DNNs and explain the essence of various deep-learning techniques.
 In Section 4 we present some interesting properties beyond sample complexity bound.
 If M is a vector, Mi denotes the i-th component of M .
To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results on statistical and computational theories of imitation learning with reward/policy function approximations.
 The claims are further corroborated with extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real images.
We will release our code and dataset to encourage future work on multi-modal models for understanding appliance usage patterns and the underlying user behavior.
 Subsequently, we generalize cyclic equivariant self-attention to multiple similarity groups and apply it on p4m-CNNs (Cohen & Welling, 2016) (equivariant to rotation and mirror reflections).
 We show that heterogeneity of training data and partial device participation slow down the convergence.
 For a learned branching strategy, it is expected that the strategy can fail to output satisfactory branching decisions from time to time.
Both of the above issues are remedied in the following description of our model.
 To verify the effectiveness of the optimization of topology in larger search spaces, we also propose a welldesigned network named TopoNet.
 In contrast, the learning rate for AISLE need not be scaled up with of K.
 It is used to replace the global pooling that commonly used in CNN.
 We verify the effect of the dilated convolution on the receptive field using mathematics and experiments.
 We investigate five real-world datasets (sources in Footnote 6).
 Thus, our algorithm also finds the set of active constraints.
 Our empirical results indicate that TPO significantly improves the performance of the baseline policy optimization algorithm, achieving up to 2.5× improvement.
In this work, we use an attention mechanism to discover the significant portions of text to be used in updating a pretrained LM.
 This variability is the core idea to obtaining a sweeter trade-off.
 Evolutionary algorithm is used to support real world constraints easily, such as low latency.
 Before turning to technical details (Section 3), we review the history of coupling neural networks to memory.
 (Menick & Kalchbrenner, 2018) explot modeling spatial PixelCNNs over subscales for global image dependencies.
Manifold learning is a family of nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques.
 The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
 The rules can inspect these structures via pattern-matching.
 We also observe that NUQSGD matches the performance of QSGDinf in terms of variance and loss/accuracy.
We examine a full-precision network with htanh activation to provide a new look in improving BNN performance.
 Different from pruning CNNtype models, BERT not only considers the metrics on the pre-training task, but also needs to makeallowance for the downstream multi-task transfer learning objectives.
 Although there have been remarkable advances in supervised methods to object perception (Redmon et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2015; Long et al., 2015), the technology should advance toward unsupervised learning as we humans do.
In many scenarios, the training data involv s privacysensitive infor ation, such as personal medical history (Jochems et al., 2016; 2017) and keyboard input history (McMahan et al., 2 16; Konen et al., 2016; Bonawitz et al., 2019), thus cannot be centralized to a data centerdue to security and legacy concerns (GDPR, 2016).
 For these models, we investigate the impact of the choice of k when training the models, and when using them to generate translations.
 While one could hope that this problem vanishes for large data sets, real data will often be concentrated around low-dimensional structure, which can be exploited by the discriminator in a similar fashion.
 Unfortunately, there is no theoretical analysis to support the experimental finding.
 In machinelearning, uncertainty-aware neural networks avoid deterministic point estimates by predicting distributions or by randomly sampling in the prediction interval.
 Under the assumption that nearby nodes tend to be in the same class, it can produce similar feature representations for nodes in the same class, thereby making them easier to be classified or clustered.
 Therefore, SDR-based evaluations measure how much the function value changes when the most high-valued salient features are removed.
 Interpretability is achieved in classical models by making strong assumptions on the data formation process and by using them on interpretable engineered features.
 In particular, our experiments show that it diminishes when a Gaussian noise model is considered (with a reasonably sized fixed or learned variance) instead of a Bernoulli.
However, mammalian brains undergo only gradual systematic forgetting suggesting that shared representations may not be the root cause of the problem.
 Suppose that the brain circuitry for a particular classification task, such as “food/not food”, is encoded in the animal’s genes, assuming each gene to have two alleles 0 and 1.
 However, we focus in their similarity as noun modifiers in both phrases.
 Rahaman et al., (2018) evaluated the Fourier spectrum of ReLU networks and empirically showed that the lower frequencies are learned first; also lower frequencies are more robust to random perturbation.
 In particular, the variants of Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG) (Johnson & Zhang, 2013), k-SVRG (Raj & Stich, 2018), L-SVRG (Kovalev et al., 2019) and Free-SVRG (Sebbouh et al., 2019) construct control-variates from previous staled snapshot model parameters.
 This then allows us to forgo the quantization operation altogether and we get an end-to-end differentiable model that can be optimized with standard gradient-based optimizers.
 In this work, we study another such heuristic—data augmentation (Bengio et al., 2011; Dao et al., 2018; Rajput et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019)—and show that it has a regularizing effect reducing what we call the rugosity, or “roughness”, of the function learned by the deep network.
In recent years, some exploration strategies try to discover novel state areas for exploring.
In this work, our goal is to develop a framework that reflects the two phases of solving action generalization: (1) general understanding of unseen discrete actions from their characteristic information (like appearance or behaviors), and (2) training a policy to solve tasks by utilizing this general understanding.
 In an application such as the search for high-performing perovskite solar cells, we are faced with an extremely large compositional space, with millions of potential candidates possessing high aleatoric noise for identical reproductions16.
The key contributions of our paper can be summarized as follows:
2. The second step aims to estimate the noise rate of the generated noisy labels by checking how often the noisy labels generated in step 1 would agree with a particular classifier.
 Typically, such a model has a variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2013)-like structure that learns a latent representation.
In addition to the general adversarial text generation framework AdvCodec, this paper also aims to explore several scientific questions: 1) Since AdvCodec allows the flexibility of manipulating on different hierarchies of the tree structures, which is more attack effective and which way preserves better grammatical correctness? 2) Is it possible to achieve targeted attack for general NLP tasks such as sentiment classification and QA, given the limited degree of freedom for manipulation? 3) Is it possible to perform blackbox attack in general NLP tasks? 4) Is BERT robust in practice? 5) Do these adversarial examples affect human reader performances?To address the above questions, we explore two types of tree based autoencoders on the word (AdvCodec(Word)) and sentence level (AdvCodec(Sent)).
 Sampling from this distribution yields instances of lower-order, likelihood functions from which the data was drawn (cf.fig.1).
 From this connection, we propose an exploration method called novelty-pursuit.
 Besides, the reconstruction g(f(x)) is not satisfactory either.
In this work, to accurately learn the task dependency in both general level and data-specific level, we propose a novel framework, ‘Learning to Transfer via ModellIng mulTi-level Task dEpeNdency’ (L2T-MITTEN).
 This raises two issues: firstly, if the machine hosting the labeled source dataset is unavailable (e.g, it is undergoing maintenance or has connectivity issues), then clearly adaptation is not possible.
 That is, we observe an increase in model probability, despite removing relevant question information and replacing it with irrelevant content.
In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of using and fine-tuning a pre-trained language model, BERT Devlin et al., (2018), in financial sentiment classification using the Financial PhraseBank created by Malo et al., (2014) and FiQA Task-1 sentiment scoring dataset in Maia et al., (2018b).
 This approach outperforms network-based approaches which usually only use information from the protein-protein interaction network.
 Yet, it is uncertain whether these convergence properties generally apply for update rules beyond gradient descent.
 The study of GZSL for multi-label text classification is largely under-explored.
 Regarding more particularly data-driven and learning-based approaches, most previous works (2; 11; 20) have addressed the learning of interpolation schemes under the assumption that a representative gap-free dataset is available.
1. Do first-order MAML-type algorithms extend to the higher dimensional parameter spaces, dense prediction, and skewed distributions required of semantic segmentation?
Synchronous SGD on large minibatches benefits from reduced variance of the stochastic gradients used in SGD.
 They use the entire label set to compute the loss and severely lack a mechanism to identify and filter out the erroneous labels from the labels set.
 As a result, they do not always produce the best results on discrete evaluation metrics on sequence generation tasks such as text summarization (Paulus et al., 2017) or question generation (Song et al., 2017).
 While some of these works rely on a single deep neural network to model the multi-task agent (Liu et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017; Hessel et al., 2018; Wulfmeier et al., 2019), others use multiple deep neural networks, e.g, one for each task and another for the multi-task agent (Rusu et al., 2015; Parisotto et al., 2015; Higgins et al., 2017; Teh et al., 2017).
2Aia:jb typically encodes the affinity between pair (i, j) and (a, b) where node i, j ∈ G1 and a, b ∈ G2.separately in local stages (Caetano et al., 2009; Cho et al., 2013).
 We extract the local representation from the local subgraph (the circle with dashed line The red wave line denote the node reachability from to . d t th h bilit f d t th dof 19,717 nodes and 44,338 edges, but only 0.3% nodes are labeled for the semi-supervised node classification task.
 Intuitively, adversarial methods encourage long-horizon imitation by providing the agent with (1) an incentive to imitate the demonstrated actions in demonstrated states, and (2) an incentive to take actions that lead it back to demonstrated states when it encounters new, out-ofdistribution states.
 In a nutshell, CatBoost performs gradient boosting on oblivious decision trees (decision tables) (Kohavi, 1994; Lou & Obukhov, 2017), which makes inference very efficient, and the method is quite resistant to overfitting.
To effectively address the problem of noisy pseudo labels in clustering-based UDA methods (Song et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019b; Yang et al., 2019) (Figure 1), we propose an unsupervised Mutual Mean-Teaching (MMT) framework to effectively perform pseudo label refinery by optimizing the neural networks under the joint supervisions of off-line refined hard pseudo labels and on-line refined soft pseudo labels.
 Given that this data is labelled, off-the-shelf supervised learning techniques can be used to train a very effective classifier for the known classes, particularly if Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed.
 The idea is to maintain two unbiased independent estimators of the action values.
 Second, the model parameters are trained separately for each node and converge at different speeds, while also offering different contributions to the target node depending on how close the two domains are.
 Our approach does not increase the size of individual layers.
 Some recent works mitigate the lack of gradient information by integrating `0 regularization with stochastic approximation (Louizos et al., 2017b) or more complex optimization methods (e.g,ADMM) (Zhang et al., 2018).
 Since the mean performance for randomlysampled architectures converges to the mean performance over the entire search space, we further conducted Welch Student’s t-tests (Welch, 1947), which reveal that, in RNN space, ENAS and DARTS cannot be differentiated from the mean of entire search space, while NAO yields worse performance than random sampling.
 The latent codes are decoded by the VAE docoder into a set of future trajectory samples, denoted as the DSF samples.
In machine learning, the regularization function r is typically used to promote a certain structure in the optimal solution, for example sparsity as in, e.g, feature selection and compressed sensing, or a zero-mean-Gaussian prior on the parameters (Bach et al., 2011; Boyd et al., 2010).
 Therefore, we address multiple NLP tasks with a single model by training a language model (LM) that generates an answer based on the context and the question.
 In this paper, we solve the large-scale sequential expensive coordination problem with a novel RL training scheme.
For spatial approaches, it is important to incorporate local structural information of the graph.
 Based on this, a line of works has been proposed (Kulesza & Taskar, 2011a; Kang, 2013; Hennig & Garnett, 2016).
Hence, we are motivated to propose a framework to automatically extract underlying relational structures from historical tasks and leverage those relational structures to facilitate knowledge ∗Work was done when Huaxiu Yao, Xian Wu, Zhiqiang Tao interned in Alibaba Group.customization on a new task.
NVIL introduces a variational distribution and derives an upper bound of the partition function in a general MRF, in the same spirit as amortized inference (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014; Mnih & Gregor, 2014) for directed models.
 Google’s Tensor Processing Unit 1.0 (TPU) (Jouppi et al., 2017), Unified Deep Neural Network Accelerator (UNPU) (Lee et al., 2018), Eyeriss (Chen et al., 2018), Stripes (Judd et al., 2016), Pragmatic(Albericio et al., 2017) and many other newly proposed hardware implementations are generally reliant on the effectiveness of the underlying quantization techniques, which are especially crucial for the low-precision integer hardware designed to process binary, ternary, 4-bit or 8-bit networks.
In this paper, we explore the feasibility of finding out labels of individual instances inside the bags only given the bag level labels, i.g,there is no individual instance level labels.
 In the lifelong learning setting, the model may even have to continuously train on an unlimited number of tasks.
 Specifying a priori the shared global, and task-specific local parts in the architecture restricts flexibility.
 f is a pre-trained substitute whitebox model to which we have full access.
 Classical approaches like search algorithms are effective but may need heavy computation, which is time-consuming.
 How to decide a QBN for each weight kernel is the most important task of the kernel-wise network quantization, since the QBNs have a large impact on the inference accuracy, latency and hardware overhead.
The recent work (Xie et al., 2019a) shows that the architectures with random connection topologies can achieve competitive performance on various tasks compared with expert-designed architectures.
 However, in some complex tasks, it is impossible to acquire or design the state or beliefs.
 Instead of estimating optimal action value function, we concentrate on learning optimal rank of actions.
Nonetheless, any distribution-free high-confidence lower bound on entropy requires a sample size exponential in the size of the bound (McAllester and Statos, 2018).
 Furthermore, various hyperparameters such as the batch-size in SGD (Smith et al., 2018), choice of optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014), discount factor γ (Jiang et al., 2015) and regularizations such as entropy (Ahmed et al., 2018) and weight norms (Cobbe et al., 2018) can also affect generalization.
 However, they suffer from deterioration of performance on clean images.
 For example, a larger range can clip fewer weights; however, the resolution becomes lower and thus damage the projection.
 However, pruning-based algorithms may degenerate in the worst case.
In general, we can understand knowledge consistency as follows.
 Hedman et al., (2018) reduces these artifacts using a deep neural network which is predicting per-pixel blending weights.
 Researchers have devised various mechanisms to generate and defend against adversarial perturbations (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016; Carlini and Wagner, 2017; Athalye et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2018; Papernot et al., 2016).
 To this end, we introduce a large-scale dataset called TABFACT, which consists of 118K manually annotated statements with regard to 16K Wikipedia tables, their relations are classified as ENTAILED and REFUTED3.
 ES has several advantages:
 Unfortunately, current MANNs such as Neural Turing Machine (NTM) (Graves et al., 2014), Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) (Graves et al., 2016) and Least Recently Used Access (LRUA) (Santoro et al., 2016) only support memory for data and embed a single program into the controller network, which goes against the stored-program memory principle.
In this work, the key insight that we leverage is that while model error and sparse cost signals can make long horizon planning difficult, we can mitigate these issues by learning to break down longhorizon tasks into short horizon segments.
 Examples include connected vehicle control (Jin & Orosz, 2014), traffic signal control (Chu et al., 2019), distributed sensing (Xu et al., 2018), and networked storage operation (Qin et al., 2016).
 Surprisingly, their model is still unable to solve the polygon reconstruction task with close-to-zero reconstruction error, despite the apparent simplicity of the dataset.
 Then, we conduct experiments (§5) on the induced constituency trees, discovering some intriguing phenomena.
Graph reasoning can be powered by Graph Neural Networks.
On the other hand, many efforts have been devoted to improving adversarial robustness in the training phase.
 However, most supervised methods have only been shown to perform well on toy datasets (Harsh Jha et al., 2018; Kulkarni et al., 2015; Mathieu et al., 2016) in which data are generated from multiplicative combination of the ground truth factors.
 However, the problem still remains.
 When initialized with small Gaussian weights and trained with a small learning rate, such a model is able to successfully recover the low-rank matrix which labeled the data, even if the problem is highly over-determined and no additional regularization is applied.
The objective is to minimize the conditional mutual information between the bottleneck layer and the privileged input, given the standard input.
 The optimal way of successfully completing the task might involve the robot doing something disruptive, like knocking a vase over (Fig 1).
 Our main contributions are as follows:
 These approaches have been successfully used for uncovering how CNNs might learn unintended spurious correlations, termed “Clever Hans” predictions (Lapuschkin et al., (2019)).
 Here, as Pr(T |X ) 6= Pr(T ), we say these datasets exhibit selection bias (Imbens & Rubin, 2015).
 Moreover, unlike most previous approaches to discovering options for exploration, it can be applied to both settings where a pretraining (unsupervised) phase is available (e.g, Eysenbach et al., 2019) and to the traditional, fully online, setting.
 Therefore, GANs and VAEs implicitly aim to accomplish two major tasks: 1) manifold embedding: to find the encoding/decoding maps between the data manifold embedded in the image space and the latent space; 2) probability distribution transport: to transport a given white noise distribution to the data distribution, either in the latent or in the image space.
 This is nothing but Boole’s insight (Boole, 1847) which set in motion the development of modern logic.
 To this end, we develop a new meta-learning algorithm that incorporates elements of imitation learning with trial-and-error reinforcement learning.
 Our key insight is that although it is highly difficult to directly create a tracker for fake objects or delete a tracker for existing objects, we can carefully design AEs to attack the tracking error reduction process in MOT to deviate the tracking results of existing objects towards an attacker-desired moving direction.
 To overcome this, Arazo et al., (2019) adopt MixUp (Zhang et al., 2018) augmentation.
 However, there is still a significant gap between adversarial robustness (test accuracy on adversarial examples) and natural accuracy (test accuracy on natural examples), even for simple image datasets like CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009).
 First, the tweaked features have to be correctly handled by the DNN on the cloud.
 Intuitively, the lack of acceleration stems from the fact that, to ensure convergence, the step size of SGD+Nesterov has to be much smaller than the optimal step size for SGD.
 We are motivated by the fact that the first few layers of most networks extract low-level information (Yosinski et al., 2014), and thus learning them may not require the high-level semantic information captured by manual labels.
 We hence consider the setting where one has access to annotations (which we call labels in the following) of the latent variables z for a very limited number of observations x, for example through human annotation.
 Two such transformations are known for feed-forward ReLU architectures:
 Autoregressive and invertible models such as PixelCNN++ (Salimans et al., 2017) and Glow (Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018) perform well in this regard and, in addition, can approximate p(x|M) with arbitrary accuracy.
 To necessitate reading comprehension, we expose the agent to ever changing environment dynamics and corresponding language descriptions such that it cannot avoid reading by memorising any particular environment dynamics.
 1Our IDA code is available at github.
 Most of these approaches have been tested only on simple tasks in simple environments, and often assume that either the environment is fixed from one episode to the next or that the agent’s goal is fixed and unchanging.
 However, PETS is not as effective on environments with higher dimensionality.
 If a value function has this property for most of the pair (s, s̃) of this type, the corresponding policy will tend to correct its errors by driving back to the demonstration states because the demonstration states have locally higher values.
 Stability of this ODE is a pre-requisite for convergence of the algorithm.
 Figure 1 shows that words highly salient for one class do not play a significant role in classifying others.
 In this paper we provide a theoretical analysis for SGD with momentum.
 The state-of-the-art victim policies were trained via self-play to be robust to opponents.
 Although a number of recent works have studied probabilistic models that can represent uncertain futures, such models are either extremely expensive computationally (as in the case of pixel-level autoregressive models), or do not directly optimize the likelihood of the data.
 Under certain conditions on the graph filter banks, GSTs are endowed with energy conservation properties (Zou & Lerman, ∗This work was mainly done while V.N. Ioanndis was working at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories.2019), as well as stability meaning robustness to graph topology deformations (Gama et al., 2019a).
 We evaluate the extent to which a pretrained model represents such knowledge by extending an existing fact completion evaluation to a cloze ranking setting that allows us to deal with a large number of multi-token entity names without manual judgments.
 First, one can re-train the model on the original dataset augmented with samples that account for the mistake.
 During execution, there is a rich and informative set of features in intermediate memory states that models can learn to drive both prediction tasks.
∗Work done during the first two authors’ research internships with Horizon Robotics Applied AI Lab.
 GAN produces sharp images based on a game-theoretic framework, but it can be difficult and unstable to train owing to multiple interaction losses.
 We design two algorithms with stateof-the-art complexities for this problem.
Another line of algorithms trains robust models by maximizing the certified radius provided by robust certification methods (Weng et al., 2018; Wong & Kolter, 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Mirman et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Gowal et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019c).
 Interestingly, we find that reconstructing∗Equal Contributions.
In this paper we present a detection mechanism that can withstand adaptive attacks.
 As most RL algorithms use a bootstrapping strategy to learn the expected return and to improve the policy (Sutton & Barto, 1998), it is challenging to train the RNN stably and efficiently, since RNNs are relatively more difficult to train (Pascanu et al., 2013) than feedforward neural networks.
 To overcome such disadvantage, instead of resetting the policy parameter with the best policy parameter periodically,∗Corresponding authorwe propose using the best policy information in a soft manner.
 While work on incorporating compositionality into emergent languages is still in its early stage, several experiments have already demonstrated that by properly choosing the maximum message length and vocabulary size, the agents can be brought together to develop a compositional language that shares similarities with natural language (Li & Bowling, 2019; Lazaridou et al., 2018; Cogswell et al., 2019).
In fact, in the recent NeurIPS 2018 Adversarial Vision Challenge (Brendel et al., 2018), many teams transferred adversarial examples from a source network as the starting point to carry out black-box boundary attack (Brendel et al., 2017).
 Another problem with the conventional model comparison methodology is that the test sets are pre-selected and therefore fixed.
 To validate our theoretical findings, we train a fully connected network on EMNIST Digits (Cohen et al., 2017) and finetune it on MNIST.
 There has been extensive research in literature following this line of research, the majority of which focuses on discounted infinite horizon MDPs (Azar et al., 2011; Even-Dar & Mansour, 2003; Sidford et al., 2018b).
 This cascade of well understood mathematical operators provides a simplified mathematical model to analyze optimization and classification performances of deep neural networks.
Ideally, a network compression framework should 1) provide provable guarantees on the tradeoff between the compression rate and the approximation error, 2) be data independent, 3) provide high compression rate, and 4) be computationally efficient.
 For SGD as well, non-existence of poor local minima is known to be a favorable property for guaranteed convergence (Ge et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2016).
 This work was fullyconducted when he was an intern student at the University of Sydney.
 However, finding a good synchronization policy is difficult, as this will at least depend on the properties of the underlying optimization problem and the nature of the cluster used for training.
Another class of works focus on specific network structure design to address multiagent learning problems (Sunehag et al., 2018; Rashid et al., 2018; Sukhbaatar et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2019).
The method employs two networks, applied in a sequential manner.
 This suggests that examples that consistently incur small losses under multiple perturbations can be considered as being clean.
 Hence, they can be exploited to effectively model complex probability distributions.
 Our certified top-k robustness leverages randomized smoothing (Cao & Gong, 2017; Cohen et al., 2019), which turns any base classifier f to be a robust classifier via adding random noise to an example.
An empirically successful approach to exploration in deep RL, especially when reward is sparse, is intrinsic motivation (Oudeyer and Kaplan, 2009).
 For example, to pick the right answer in the VQA task, the network should empower integrating linguistic information from the question and the answers, and aggregating visual information from the input image, together with aligning the linguistic meanings with the visual clues.
 A recent work that ∗Equal contributions.
 Distinguishing between sources of uncertainty is important, as in certain machine learning applications it may be necessary to know not only whether the model is uncertain, but also why.
 ASGD enjoys linear speedup in terms of the number of workers, even on non-dedicated networks.
 Second, it is well known that for some metric spaces (X , dX ), including large classes of symmetric graphs (e.g, constant-degree expanders and k-regular graphs), there is no embedding φ : X → Rn that can model dX precisely using ‖ · ‖2 (Indyk et al., 2017).
 Chief among these characteristics is the emergence of regions where power-law behavior approximates the error well both with respect to data size, when holding model size fixed, and vice versa.
 To circumvent this difficulty, prior systems have used three different approaches.
approximators and have been successfully applied in various domains that require modeling of arbitrary functions (Hornik et al., 1989; Goodfellow et al., 2016).
 Despite their prevalence in the literature, classical video prediction architectures suffer from two major limitations.
 Order learning is also related to metric learning (Xing et al., 2003).
 Similar to the format of multiple-choice reading comprehension datasets (Richardson et al., 2013; Lai et al., 2017), it contains a context, a question and four options with only one right answer.
 Unlike previous neural architecture search methods for images that focus on finding a good ‘module’ of convolutional layers to be repeated in a single-stream networks (Zoph et al., 2018; Real et al., 2019), our objective is to search for higher-level connections between multiple sequential or concurrent blocks to form multi-stream architectures.
 We identify a cause for this shortcoming in the classical Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) objective, the evidence lower bound (ELBO), that fails to control the behaviour of the encoder out of the support of the empirical data distribution.
 In practice, this has been attributed to overly simplistic prior distributions (Tomczak & Welling, 2018; Dai & Wipf, 2019) or alternatively, to the inherent over-regularization induced by the KL divergence term in the VAE objective (Tolstikhin et al., 2017).
 Lin et al., (2017a) allocates objects of different scales into different feature resolutions to capture the appropriate ERF in each stage.
 As an example, consider the case of a self-driving agent, where it is near impossible to exhaustively model all interactions of the agent with other drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, weather conditions, even in simulation.
 However, despite the theoretical advancements reached by the latest contributions in the field, we find that the experimental settings are in many cases ambiguous or not reproducible.
 The most influential generalization analyses in terms of distance from initialization have thus far concentrated on networks with fully connected layers.
 1We note that, as very recently pointed out by Tran et al., (2019), there still exists a minor theoretical flaw in the analysis of Reddi et al., (2018), and such issue in fact appears in many of recent variants of AMSgrad/AdamNC.
In this work, we develop an approximate Bayesian approach for training Bayesian neural networks (BNN) (Hinton & van Camp, 1993; Graves, 2011; Blundell et al., 2015) incrementally with nonstationary streaming data.
 We begin with a once-off preprocessing step.
 Unfortunately, BC has a fundamental drawback.
In this paper, we show that an attacker can launch a target-agnostic attack and fool the network when only the pre-trained model is available to the attacker.
 Specifically, the encoder of the generation model consists of two independent components with one for encoding the context and the other for representing the knowledge.
In the following sections, we review the related works to stereoscopic view synthesis and discuss the differences with our proposed method, followed by the formulation of our Deep 3d Pan pipeline and finally, we present outstanding results on various challenging stereo datasets, showing superior performance against the previous state-of-the-art methods.
 As attentions typically have query, key and value components, our model uses hierarchical accumulation to encode the value component of each nonterminal node by aggregating the hidden states of all of its descendants.
In particular, the moments of the matrices I and S add up: tr(Hk) ≈ tr(Ik) + tr(Sk).
 Although such a Nash equilibrium corresponds to an infinite number of agents, it well approximates the Nash equilibrium for a sufficiently large number of agents (Bensoussan et al., 2016).
 The second approach, the verification of neural networks, takes a trained network as input and focuses only on the verification task (Katz et al., 2017; Weng et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2019).
 Li et al., (2017) propose a method called MMD-GAN, in which the critic maps the samples from the generator and the data into a lower-dimensional representation, and MMD is applied in this transformed space.
 Property signatures can then be used for consumption by machine learning algorithms, essentially serving as the first layer of a neural network.
 However, the inter-clip interaction and video-level fusion in TSN is only performed at very late stage, which fails to capture finer temporal structures.
 Thus, researchers typically use different settings in different applications and have to take a trial-and-error approach, which can be tedious and time-consuming.
 We present a simple method that employs supervised regression to fit dynamical distances, and then uses these distances to provide reward shaping, guide exploration, and discover distinct skills.
In the episodic setup, the selection of k during meta-training time can have significant effects on the learning outcomes of the meta-learner.
Code is available at github. denoted by the large green plus sign.
 This view highlights the role of partition functions estimation, which is the culprit of high variance issues in MINE.
 In other words, what we perceive is largely a mental simulation of the external world.
 In Mao et al., (2019), at least two samples generated from the same condition are needed for calculating the regularization term, which multiplies the memory footprint while training each mini-batch.
While attractive for their simplicity, fixed mapping schemes based on user settings place no guarantees on optimizing network performance, and quantization error minimization schemes might perfectly minimize quantization error and yet still be non optimal if a different quantization mapping actually minimizes task error.
 However, as we continue to zoom in, we quickly reach limits.
 We can tackle the aforementioned problems by selecting, in an efficient and effective way, which regions of the images should be labeled next.
 Our intuition arises from observing that estimating the sign of the top 30% gradient coordinates by magnitude is enough to achieve a rough misclassification rate of 70%.
 Most existing “semi-supervised” AD methods, both shallow (Muñoz-Marí et al., 2010; Blanchard et al., 2010; Chandola et al., 2009) and deep (Song et al., 2017; Akcay et al., 2018; Chalapathy & Chawla, 2019), only incorporate the use of labeled normal samples but not labeled anomalies, i.g,they are more precisely instances of Learning from Positive (i.g,, normal) and Unlabeled Examples (LPUE) (Denis, 1998; Zhang & Zuo, 2008).
 Here, the allowed budget refers to a limitation on the total time, compute, or cost spent on training.

 In particular, Du et al., (2017) showed that SVRG Johnson and Zhang (2013) and SAGA Defazio et al., (2014) can be applied to improve1We call the increment in each iteration of TD as "pseudo-gradient" because such a quantity is not a gradient of any objective function, but the role that it serves in the TD algorithm is analogous to the role of the gradient in the gradient descent algorithm.
The main limitation of current distribution matching approaches is that estimating distribution density ratios (the first step of every iteration) typically requires samples from the behavior policy distribution.
 Our main contributions are:
 We present this stronger version because it motivates our work better.
While low perplexity in the limit should lead to predicting the correct next target word, there are two major flaws of the likelihood objective: (i) it pays relatively little attention to the argmax or the top of the ranked list of next token probabilities, instead optimizing the likelihood of the entire distribution; ∗Equal contribution; the ordering was decided by a coin flip.
 We demonstrate that the addition of even modest amounts of supervision can be sufficient to achieve this reliability.
 Local ensembles are a computationally cheap, post-hoc alternative to fully trained ensembles, and do not require special training procedures of approximate ensembling methods that measure related, but distinct, notions of uncertainty (Gal & Ghahramani, 2015; Blundell et al., 2015).
We motivate the novelty and benefit of using mode connectivity for mitigating training-phase adversarial threats through the following practical scenario: as training DNNs is both time- and resource-consuming, it has become a common trend for users to leverage pre-trained models released in the public domain1.
While parameter transfer algorithms can move towards this goal by peforming task-specific optimization locally, thus preventing direct access to private data, this provision is far from fail-safe in terms of privacy.
 We advocate that a more challenging and realistic benchmark is required for further progress in this area.
 While BERT-style cross-attention models are very successful, it cannot be directly applied to large-scale retrieval problems because computing f(q,d) for every possible document can be prohibitively expensive.
 This means that the responsibility of evoking desirable behavior is entirely deferred to engineering the input reward function.
 To tackle the problems of efficient exploration and credit assignment in this complex problem setting, we develop CM3, a novel general framework involving three synergistic components:

 While greedy sampling that passively filter samples based on the fitness estimations from the cost models work, many of their hardware measurements (required for optimization) tend to be redundant and wasteful.
The neural circuit of Mély et al., (2018) explains how contextual illusions might emerge, but it does not explain why.
∗Equal contribution: order between first authors is arbitrary.
• Exactly how does distillation reduce the “modes”, and how we could we measure this reduction quantitatively? Why does this reduction consistently improve NAT models?• What is the relationship between the NAT model (student) and the AT model (teacher)? Are different varieties of distilled data better for different NAT models?• Due to distillation, the performance of NAT models is largely bounded by the choice of AT teacher.
 Given the same global trigger pattern as the centralized attack, DBA decomposes it into local patterns and embed them to different adversarial parties respectively.
 (4.2) Gradient updates cease to be meaningful, since the model parameters in QNNs are coarsely quantized.
 Taken together, these techniques apply in all circumstances in which Batch Normalization is currently used, ranging from large to very small batch sizes, including one method which is even useful when the batch size B = 1, and for each technique we identify the circumstances under which it is expected to be of use.
 Given the loss function f with its parameter θ to be optimized (called the optimizee), we can obtain its ZO gradient estimator by:∇̂f(θ) = (1/µq) ∑qi=1 f(θ + µui)− f(θ)ui (1)1Our code is available at github.,where µ is the smoothing parameter, {ui} are random query directions drawn from standard Gaussian distribution (Nesterov & Spokoiny, 2017) and q is the number of sampled query directions.

Despite the improved generalization guarantees, these confidence estimates still do not come with theoretical guarantees.
 Forexample, in computer vision tasks, the pixels representing the object of interest are typically more important than the background pixels.
 Jointly learning the parser and executor using only QA supervision is also extremely challenging (§2.2).
Off-the-shelf text decoders, image encoders, and GANs can be directly plugged into the VHE-GAN framework for end-to-end multi-modality learning.
 Therefore, it is urgently needed to study the transferability of NAS for large-scale model deployment in practical application.
To gain a sense for the challenges surrounding natural language generation, we need to first understand how large this space really is.

 These methods are restricted to learning embeddings using link prediction objective.
 In the original method named NOTEARS (Zheng et al., 2018), the directed graph is encoded as a weighted adjacency matrix which represents coefficients in a linear structural equation model (SEM) (Pearl, 2009) (see Section 2.3) and enforces acyclicity using a constraint which is both efficiently computable and easily differentiable, thus allowing the use of numerical solvers.
 2Without using the kernel trick, these classifiers include linear regression, logistic regression, support vectormachine, and linear neural networks.
 The question then is, what is it about the dynamics of GD that makes it possible to extract common patterns from the data? And what does it mean for a pattern to be common?Since the only change to the network parameters in GD comes from the gradients, the mechanism to detect commonality amongst examples must be through the gradients.
 In this paper we rely on these findings to investigate how we can take inspiration from neuroscience models to investigate and enhance inferential reasoning in neural networks.
 For complex dialogues extended over many turns and multiple domains, the time cost will increase significantly in both encoding and decoding phases.
 The qualitative aspects of the CTRNN dynamics is transparent in its integral form:g(t) = e−α t−t0 τ g(t0) + 1τ ∫ t t0 e−α t−s τ φ(Ug(s) +Wx(s) + b)ds (2)This integral form reveals that the partials of hidden-state vector with respect to the initial condition, ∂g(t) ∂g(t0), gets attenuated rapidly (first term in RHS), and so we face a vanishing gradient problem.
 As a result, this paradigm provides a simple and quantitative scheme for measuring the importance of the weights at various points early in training within an actionable and causal framework.
 1In the context of this paper, we use ”batch size/normalization batch size” to refer the number of samples used to compute statistics unless otherwise stated.
 However, the amount of communicated data is directly proportional to the total size of collected samples.
 Although it has been proposed that adversarial and manipulation robustness can be increased through various mechanisms during the training phase, such as fine-tuning, recent research has shown that these methods are mostly ineffective or their effectiveness is inconclusive (Geirhos et al., (2018); Uesato et al., (2018); Athalye et al., (2018)).
Inspired by the great empirical success of residual networks (ResNets), Hardt & Ma (2016) considered identity parameterizations in deep linear networks, i.g,, parameterizing each layer’s weight matrix as I`W, which leads to the so-called deep linear ResNets.
 Financial market data of individual stocks can be grouped together based on the industrial sector to which a company belongs.
 This is partially because in language generation applications (e.g, machine translation) hypotheses are often very far from the ground-truth target, especially in low-resource settings.
 In these problems, we only partially observe the events (e.g, users interact with items, locations) for each subprocess (user).
In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic type inference algorithm for TypeScript to address these shortcomings using a graph neural network architecture (GNN) (Veličković et al., 2018; Li et al., 2016; Mou et al., 2016).
 This allows the latent factors that contribute to the overall facial attributes to be disentangled into two factors: one that is relevant to the voice and the other that is irrelevant.
 Our models map the 2.5D input streams into 3D feature volumes of the depicted scene.
 However, such a joint learning scheme makes it unclear how the long-tailed recognition ability is achieved—is it from learning a better representation or by handling the data imbalance better via shifting classifier decision boundaries? To answer this question, we take one step back and decouple long-tail recognition into representation learning and classification.
 This is especially crucial in the Sim2Real setting (Andrychowicz et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2018; Wulfmeier et al., 2017; Rastogi et al., 2018; Christiano et al., 2016) where a policy is trained in a simulator and then executed on a∗Equal contribution †Work done during an internship at Deepmindreal-world domain.

This paper demonstrates that the novel application of auxiliary models, namely privacy-preserving generative models, can stand in for direct data examination during the process of debugging data errors during inference or training.
Despite their success on benchmarks, ensembles are limited in practice due to their expensive computational and memory costs, which increase linearly with the ensemble size in both training and testing.
 However, rather than keeping symmetric forward and backward paths, the reciprocal propagation of the activities are realized through learned connections.
 In common, the methods in Chen et al., (2015); de Bezenac et al., (2018); Lutter et al., (2019) are not efficiently applicable to sparsely discretized input as only a small number of data points are available and continuous properties on given space are not easily recovered.
 This entails the following novel techniques:
 During training, only the model generated tokens are fed into the model so that the exposure bias is avoided.
 Our approach considers the smoothness of the loss function used.
 b Feature extraction: re-training a few output layers of the duplicated source model (Whatmough et al., 2019).
 While their method is shown to give more accurate predictions than previous algorithms, it is limited in several important ways:• The method requires that data be collected by a known behavior policy.
 Specifically, we propose (to the best of our knowledge) the first normalization layer for GNNs that is applied in-between intermediate layers during training.

 As humans, we naturally describe images by using factors of variations suggesting that they are an efficient representation of natural images.
 In particular, insight about∗This research was carried out during Y.D. Zhong’s internship at Siemens Corporate Technology.
 Consequently, `0- or `1-based objectives result only in local methods (i.g, cannot yield the entire solution at once) and hence entail prohibitive computational burden.
Unsupervised event detection in a data stream is intrinsically challenging because we do not know what patterns to look for.
 It is an increasingly compelling question whether we can establish theories for training neural networks beyond the NTK regime.
 Waugh et al., (2015) combines regression tree function approximation with CFR based on handcrafted features, which is called Regression CFR (RCFR).
 Using this metric of alignment, we show that multilingual BERT achieves zero-shot transfer because its embeddings are partially aligned, as depicted in Figure 1, with the degree of alignment predicting the degree of downstream transfer.
 Specifically, we:
 Instead of returning p1, we use it to find a distinguishing input x∗ that leads to ambiguities, i.g,, other programs pi that satisfy I but produce different outputs p1(x∗) 6= pi(x∗).
 This is outlined in Section 4.
In this work, we introduce generalized learning for random forests with convolutional neural networks to address these issues.
 While few studies have performed extensive hyperparameter search for learning rate and weight decay (Mahajan et al., 2018; Kornblith et al., 2019), the momentum coefficient is rarely changed.
 JH ran the story generation with skeleton prefixes.
 Although these methods achieve 3D object generation by controlling the object identity and camera poses independently, the construction of such datasets requires considerable time and effort.
Under-sensitivity behaviour is not reflected in nominal accuracy, but one can instead use this specification to measure and evaluate the extent with which samples exhibit undersensitivity.
 A natural question to ask is this: can an improvement in Jacobian saliency induce robustness in models? In other words, could this side effect be a new avenue to boost model robustness? To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to show affirmative findings for this question.
1 Our goal is to develop a simple baseline for few-shot learning, one that does not require specialized training depending on the number of ways or shots, nor hyper-parameter tuning for different protocols.
 We refer to this as black-box verification.
 Such a factored objective is insufficient for transferring structural knowledge, i.g,dependencies between output dimensions i and j.
 However, to make the action space tractable, such systems still rely on a set of equivalent transformation actions defined by human beings, which again suffers from the labeling cost and learning bias.
 We first organize the network training and augmentation policy search in an adversarial and online manner.
 Generally, a meta-learner is trained on a series of tasks with random training and test splits.

 Our contributions are several-fold.
 A complexity measure may depend on the properties of the trained model, optimizer, and possibly training data, but should not have access to a validation set.
 In this paper, we develop the first robustness verification algorithm for Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) with self-attention layers.
 Keriven & Peyré (2019) solves a more general problem of building networks that are equivariant universal over arbitrary high order input tensors Rnd (including graphs); their construction, however, uses higher order tensors as hidden variableswhich is of less practical value.

 Mathematically, if X = (X,X , µ) and Y = (Y,Y, ν) are probability spaces with probability measures µ and ν respectively, this can be written asν(A) = µ({x : G(x) ∈ A}) = µ(G−1(A)) def≡ (G∗µ)(A) for all A ∈ Y, (2)Or in words, the probability measure ν equals the push-forward measure G∗µ.
 Specifically, we elucidate the cause of undesirable convergence of GDA  the These two authors contributed equally.
 Therefore, the expansion methods can bypass catastrophic forgetting by preventing pre-existing components from being overwritten by the new information.
 Preconceived notions of the two being fundamentally different (see Appendix (Section 7)) have been reinforced in the existing literature, arguing they belong in different applications: (Positional) Node embeddings would find applications in multi-ary relationships such as link prediction, clustering, and natural language processing and knowledge acquisition through word and entity embeddings.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to focus on calibration for knowledge embeddings.
 This can be verified in real collaborative filtering datasets as shown in Figure 1 (upper left corner) where users have a similar average rating for test data regardless of the number of known ratings (see also other two examples in Figure 1).
 1When counting the number of layers (or network depth) of GCN, this paper does not involve the input layer.
In this work, we propose a novel method for unsupervised image-to-image translation, which incorporates a new attention module and a new learnable normalization function in an end-to-end manner.
 By conditionally turning parts of the architecture on or off we can train networks with very large capacity while keeping the computational overhead small.
 We do this by maximizing the mutual information between the representations of the two views (Multi-ViewInfoMax objective) while at the same time eliminating the information not shared between them, since it is guaranteed to be superfluous.
As subsampling is non-differentiable, its integration into an end-to-end optimized deep learning model is non-trivial.
 When the training dataset contains a handful of outliers, the output model of a stable learning algorithm should be close to the one trained on the clean portion of the training set.
 In this work we consider∗Google AI Residentlearning an optimizer that satisfies these requirements.
This motivates our work.
 To address these shortcomings, we propose EMPIR, an ensemble of mixed precision 1 DNN models, as a new form of defense against adversarial attacks and demonstrate that it can significantly improve the robustness of a variety of DNN models across a wide range of adversarial attacks.
 These findings are mathematically modeled by sub-Riemannian geometry on Lie groups (Petitot, 2003; Citti & Sarti, 2006; Duits et al., 2014) and led to effective algorithms in image analysis (Franken & Duits, 2009; Bekkers et al., 2015b; Favali et al., 2016; Duits et al., 2018; Baspinar, 2018).
 In contrast, we focus on pruning.
We analyze the two-languages version of M-BERT (B-BERT, for bilingual BERT, from now on) in three orthogonal dimensions: (i) linguistic properties and similarities of target and source languages; (ii) network architecture, and (iii) input and learning objective.
 Moreover, to obtain a complete scene, a component needs to refer to other components, and thus inference is inherently performed sequentially, resulting in limitations in scaling to scenes with many objects.
 (i) The Type of loss function that quantifies the distortion is optimizing local neighbourhood 44; 21 or global graph structure properties 53; 40; 14.
 To this end, we design a simple variant of graph neural networks, named ExpressGNN, which can be efficiently trained in the variational EM framework for MLN.
 In particular, the learning method uses an MPC controller where the terminal cost and terminal policy are the solution of an unconstrained infinite-horizon Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR).
 We are again able to show speed-ups for CHOCO-SGD over the decentralized baseline (Lian et al., 2017) with much less communication overhead.
 The key to success in (Uesato et al., 2018) is the availability of agent training history.
These findings raise the question, do self-attention layers process images in a similar manner to convolutional layers? From a theoretical perspective, one could argue that transfomers have the capacity to simulate any function—including a CNN.
 To address this issue, Nachum et al., (2019) proposes a policy-agnostic method, DualDice, which learns the joint state-action stationary distribution correction that is much higher dimension, and therefore needs more model parameters than the state stationary distribution.
 Meta-RL has been widely explored recently, in some cases with a focus on reducing the amount of experience needed by initializing the RL algorithm well (Finn et al., 2017; Clavera et al., 2019) and, in others, for efficient exploration (Duan et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017).
 An environment has partial observability if the agent can only observe a part of the environment at each timestep.
Nichol et al., (2018) notice that most of the existing meta-learning methods involve transduction unintentionally since they use xt implicitly via the batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015).
 For the general case, likelihood has been shown to be a poor detector of OOD samples.
 On the other extreme, fully unsupervised disentanglement takes as input a set of images with no further information.
 Recently, variants of the VAE have been introduced for spherical (Davidson et al., 2018; Xu & Durrett, 2018) and hyperbolic (Mathieu et al., 2019; Nagano et al., 2019) latent spaces.
 We learn the parameters of the reward model, w, simultaneously with the parameters of the policy.
 The second class of black-box attacks, which show better empirical performance than the substitute model approaches, numerically estimate the gradient of the target model by repeatedly querying it (Chen et al., 2017; Ilyas et al., 2018; Tu et al., 2018) and attack with the estimated gradient.
 A meal can be served with different dishes and drinks (e.g, boiled egg and coffee), where each could be considered as a subtask.
 In turn, we quantify the novelty of the input by aggregating these two sets of hidden activation values.
 We envision that the key to solving these challenges lies in the adaption of the most suited geometric data structures to synergistically handle the Eulerian and Lagrangian aspects of the problem.
 Schmaltz showed that recurrent neural network language models (Mikolov et al., 2010) with long short-term memory (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) cells work effectively for word ordering even without any explicit syntactic information.
 Instead, we propose to use a sequence of teacher-student pairs that progressively bridges the architectural gap.
 From fig. 1(b)(c), we see that as we increase β, instead of going up smoothly, both I(X;Z) and I(Y ;Z) show multiple phase transitions, where the slopes dI(X;Z)dβ and dI(Y ;Z) dβ are discontinuous and the accuracy has discrete jumps.
 DARTS and related methods (Liu et al., 2019a; Chen et al., 2019b; Liang et al., 2019) use around 10 different operations between two network nodes.
 Specifically, the representations are learned by extracting taskrelated information from the original data while being constrained to discard parts that are irrelevant to the task.
 To this end, we systematically studied the computation breakdown of the transformer and observed that the computation is dominated by the feed-forward network (FFN), not the attention.
 This revised view of approximation theory should also change how we view issues such as depth separation: rather then asking how increasing depth can reducethe number of units required to fit a function, we should instead ask how increasing depth can reduce the norm required, i.g,, how the representational cost we study changes with depth.
Inspired by VAT, we propose a method called Adversarial Lipschitz Regularization (ALR), enabling the training of neural networks with regularization terms penalizing the violation of the Lipschitz constraint explicitly, instead of through the norm of the gradient.
 Compositional generalization is critical in human cognition (Minsky, 1986; Lake et al., 2017).
 This is a more general formulation since it poses fewer requirements on the experts and makes demonstration collection easier.
 While learning such features leads to superior performance on the training\\u2217Work done while Tiange Luo, Kaichun Mo, Jiarui Xu, and Siyu Hu were visiting UC San Diego.categories, they often fail miserably on unseen categories (Figure 1) due to the difference of global shapes.
 However, the attack does not explicitly control visual semantic representation.
 DRAGAN (Kodali et al., 2017) introduces another form of gradient penalty where the gradients at Gaussian perturbations of training data are penalized.
Approximation via sampling of transport mappings.
The first and foremost limitation is scalability.
 A common theme among such defenses is accuracypreserving posterior perturbation: the posterior distribution is manipulated while retaining the top-1 label.
 Our formulation reflects the intuition that source and target domain networks should be similar because they solve closely related problems, but should also perform domain-specific computations to offset the domain shift.
 To this point, there are no probabilistic deep learning models for uncertainty of orientations that take the geometry of the underlying domain into account.
 Based on the idea that equivariance in CNNs can be extended to larger transformation groups by stacking convolutional feature maps, several approaches have emerged to extend equivariance to, e.g, planar rotations (Dieleman et al., 2016; Marcos et al., 2017; Weiler et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018), spherical rotations (Cohen et al., 2018; Worrall & Brostow, 2018; Cohen et al., 2019), scaling (Marcos et al., 2018; Worrall & Welling, 2019) and general transformation groups (Cohen & Welling, 2016), such that transformed copies of a single entity are not required to be learned independently.
More recent research (Jain et al., 2019; Esser et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018; Elthakeb et al., 2018) focuses on methods which can also learn the optimal quantization parameters, e.g, the stepsize, dynamic range and bitwidth, in parallel to the network weights.
 Here, we make these arguments mathematically rigorous and propose a non-uniform sampling scheme for scalably approximating a softmax classification scheme.
 In this paper, we introduce the first method for making this possible.
 On the other hand, Monte-Carlo dropout can be viewed (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016) as a certain form of Bayesian inference.
 Despite of the impressive progress in understanding the training behavior of RNNs, there is no generalization guarantee in these works.
 Further, against a novel system, stealing its architectural details increases the reliability of black-box poisoning and evasion attacks (Demontis et al., 2019).
 The term ‘time step’ defines an unit of time required to process a single input spike across all layers and represents the network latency.
 Note that the statement made by the certificate (i.g,, that the input image is not an adversarial example in the chosen norm) is still technically correct, however in this case the adversary is hiding behind a certificate to avoid detection by a certifiable defense.
However, monotonic attention-based models, including the state-of-the-art MILk, were built on top of RNN-based models.
 Specifically, our gradient-based features are inspired by the neural tangent kernel (NTK) (Jacot et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019; Arora et al., 2019b), and adapt NTK in the setting of finite-width networks.
 The neurons thereby retain their abilities to extract features from the source domain, and contribute to the network’s performance on the target dataset.

In this paper, we investigate the expressive power of graph NNs by analyzing their asymptotic behaviors as the layer size goes to infinity.
 For example, in the chemical domain labels are typically produced with a costly Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation.
 The question of whether or not the DNN architecture itself can expose more transferability of adversarial attacks is an unexplored problem.
In this paper, we present a universal visual representation (VR) method1 relying only on image-monolingual annotations instead of the existing approach that depends on image-bilingual annotations, thus breaking the bottleneck of using visual information in NMT.
 These methods focus on adapting the classifier of the same category from the source to the target domain.
 The term “selective plasticity” refers to the desired capability of a network to selectively increase or decrease the plasticity of individual synapses throughout the neural architecture.
 It is a well-known result that equalized odds is incompatible with demographic parity (Barocas et al., 2017) except in degenerate cases where group membership is independent∗Part of this work was done when Han Zhao was visiting the Vector Institute, Toronto.of the target variable.

 Glenn contributed to designing the final environment and created final renderings and project video.
 These discrepancies raise a comparability problem when comparing the performance of various NAS algorithms, making it difficult to conclude their contributions.
 Instead, it requires substantial domain expertise to carefully select examples and target labels that are correlated with the downstream task of interest.
 However, if we can sequentially model the history of knowledge selection in previous turns, we can reduce the scope of probable knowledge candidates at current turn.
 With a high level view of the library in hand, we then dive into a number of technical aspects of our library (§3).

 As a human inspects instances, he labels them, and then generalizes them to rules.
 Hence, they preserve the relative directional information between neighboring atoms.
 These bounds are beneficialbecause the bounds are not explicitly dependent on the number of parameters and thus are useful to explain the generalization error of overparameterized network (Bartlett, 1998; Neyshabur et al., 2015; 2019).
 The main problem in such training is that, since the PS updates the parameters whenever a device communicates with him, the parameters that are being used in other devices calculation are no longer up-to-date.
 Furthermore, the variables discovered correspond to the true generating latent variables, up to a trivial component-wise translation and scaling.
 (ii) The parameterization should be differentiable in order to be learned as a component of end-to-end ML pipelines, enabling it to easily be used as a drop-in replacement for manually engineered structured components.
 These subnetworks are called winning tickets.
 Such a framework is inspired by the InfoMax principle (Linsker, 1988) and has been the main driver of progress in self-supervised representation learning in other domains such as computer vision, audio processing, and reinforcement learning (Belghazi et al., 2018; van den Oord et al., 2019; Hjelm et al., 2019;Bachman et al., 2019; O’Connor & Veeling, 2019).
 Such aggregation loses the structural information of nodes in neighborhood because it does not distinguish the “messages” from different nodes.
 Another example is off-line PageRank (OPR), where we seek to estimate the relative importance of webpages given a sample of the web graph.
 For example, when a mobile phone is turned off or WiFi access is unavailable, the central server will lose connection to this device.

 In this work, we focus on improving the branching strategies.
 While intuitive, as Section 4 shows, this interpretation cannot account for all the observed phenomena.
The contributions of this paper can be summarized as:
 Since the Q function can be treated as a giant matrix, with rows as states and columns as actions, a structured Q function naturally translates to a structured Q matrix.
 This suggests that building reliable deep RL algorithms requires moving past benchmark-centric evaluations to a multi-faceted understanding of their often unintuitive behavior.
 1 We pinpoint these optimizations, and run an ablation study demonstrating that they are instrumental to the PPO’s performance.
 Specifically, we first obtain set-representations for each task, which are learned to convey useful statistics about the task or class distribution, such as mean, variance, and cardinality (the number of elements in the set), and then learn the distribution of three balancing variables a function of the set: 1) task-dependent learning rate multiplier, which decides how far away to deviate from the meta-knowledge, when performing task-specific learning.
 The energy function is either estimated by physics-based thermodynamic experiments (Lorenz et al., 2011; Bellaousov et al., 2013; Markham & Zuker, 2008) or learned from data (Do et al.,2006).
 Further, the whole corpus used to train BERT only requires 17GB to store.

The goal of this paper is to build translation equivariance into NPs.
 Overall, we can see this method as bridging the gap between adversarial training and provable defenses (it can conceptually be instantiated with any convex relaxation).
 Probabilistic Federated Neural Matching (PFNM) (Yurochkin et al., 2019b) addresses this problem by matching the neurons of client NNs before averaging them.
 Given a trajectory with a terminal sparse reward, we first parameterize the score of an action-local region pair with a convolutional neural network F and then aggregate the scores to approximate the final sparse reward.
 Crystal structure phase mapping is yet substantially more complex.
 The key to solving this composition objective is how to estimate the value of G(xk) and its Jacobian with high accuracy using only a few samples in each iteration.
More recently, and due to the popularity of the piecewise linear ReLU as an activation function, there has been a surge in the number of works that study this class of DNNs in particular.
 In Parisotto & Salakhutdinov (2018), for instance, different cells in a neural map correspond to different positions of the agent.
In this study, we introduce a method to address the limitations of previous approaches by constructing adversarial examples that explicitly preserve the semantics of the inputs.
 2) Robust loss functions (Van Rooyen et al., 2015; Ghosh et al., 2017; Zhang & Sabuncu, 2018; Wang et al., 2019b); 3) Explicit regularisation techniques (Arpit et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018a).
 It is known, for instance, that the gain in generalization provided by dropout comes at the cost of using larger models and training for longer (Goodfellow et al., 2016).
 We resort to the term Boolean instead of binary to emphasize that we work directly on the Boolean space {−1,+1}, without any continuous relaxations or quantizations.
 The root node denotes the entire dataset and each node denotes a subset of the entire dataset.
 The main idea behind GMLP is to learn and leverage expressive feature subsets, henceforth referred to as feature groups.
To be useful in practice, locally interpretable models need to maximize two objectives: (i) the overall prediction performance (how well it predicts compared to the ground truth labels) – for the model to be accurate, and (ii) fidelity (how well it approximates the ‘black-box’ model predictions) – to ensure the model is reliably approximating the black-box model’s predictions in the neighborhoodof interest (Plumb et al., 2019; Lakkaraju et al., 2019).
In addition to improving performance in such scenarios, data valuation also enables many new use cases.
As a coin has two sides, every existing NST method has both advantages and shortcomings.fig. 1 (b) shows some typical examples, we can observe that using Gram matrices Gatys et al., (2016) to transfer the artistic styles performs well on global color, but fails to capture enough local patterns (e.g, circles and droplets).
 (a) One of the most important factors in designing anchors is how densely it covers the instance location space.
 The residual topology was widely approved and applied in the following works, e.g, MobileNet (Sandler et al., 2018; Howard et al., 2019) and ShuffleNet (Zhang et al., 2018).
 As a result, there may be many equilibria, and majority of them are unstable.
 Last but not least, we show several novel applications that are only possible because of the unique features of DAP, including universal source separation, interactive editing, audio texture synthesis, and audio co-separation.
 Only guided by the instance prediction, the ‘circle’ class in the target domain and the ‘square’ class in the source domain are easily confused, causing the misalignment in the adversarial domain adaptation.
In this paper, a skill is a policy that changes the state of the environment in a consistent way.
 This representation is powerful as it enables us to analyze the gradient behavior symbolically and abstracts away the unnecessary bookkeeping of derivatives and weights.
 (1) Particularly with high-dimensional input noise, the amount of data augmentation necessary to sufficiently capture the noise space will be very large, which will increase training time.
 Network defense aims to train networks that are robust against adversarial attacks through means of robust training or procedures at inference time that dampen the effectiveness of the attack (Madry et al., 2018; Wong & Kolter, 2018; Raghunathan et al., 2018; Alfadly et al., 2019).
 By contrast, the signal-detection measures more closely capture the level of selectivity displayed in the jitterplots (Sec.3.1).
 As for training, there are many circumvention ways to strengthen the accuracy of SNNs, except for neuromorphic methodology such as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) (Serrano-Gotarredona et al., 2013), winner-taken all (WTA) (Makhzani & Frey, 2015).
 (1.2)This gives a similar parameterization to 14 that study convergence of gradient optimization of convolutional filters on Gaussian data.
Based on the hierarchical framework of GraphSAGE, GAT (Velickovic et al., (2017)) uses given class labels to guide attention over neighborhood so as to aggregate useful feature information.
 FALCON overcomes the limitations of the previous methods based on the depthwise separable convolution using the following two main ideas.
• IWAE.
 To be specific, the goal of runtime approaches aims to evaluate the channel importance at runtime, which is assumed to be different on different input instances.
 In their work (Hung et al., 2018), the confidence map is the output of a GAN discriminator network (Goodfellow et al., 2014), where the discriminator network learns to distinguish between the segmentation map and the ground truth map.
 Some recent alternating minimization methods have focused on applying the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) (Taylor et al., (2016); Wang et al., (2019)) and Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) (Jinshan Zeng (2018)), with empirical evaluations demonstrating good scalability in terms of the number of layers and high accuracy on the test sets, especially for neural networks that are very deep, thanks to parallelism (Taylor et al., (2016); Wang et al., (2019)).
Recent works in the field of image generation include pix2pix Isola et al., (2017) offering image generation from semantic maps, cascaded refinement networks Chen & Koltun (2017) using networks refining different resolutions in a cascade manner, pix2pixHD Wang et al., (2018b) can generate HD images in a conditional manner using multi-scale discriminator and an dual generatorused as a super resolution generator.
 However, such a conversion process does not only introduces nontrivial errors but also runs slowly, preventing the approach from being applied at an interactive rate1 .
 Given that the number of objects a human can interpret is limited (Miller, 1956), outputting few prototypes can be an effective approach for humans to understand the AI model behavior.
 By coregistration, we mean the problem of registering all low-resolution views to improve their fusion.
 Specifically, the policy network consists of a graph-embedding network that encodes operation features and dependencies into a trainable graph representation, followed by a scalable sequence-to-sequence placement network based on an improved Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2019).
 In similar fashion, graph neural networks exploit graph isomorphism algorithms andhave been shown to be as powerful as k-dimensional WL algorithm (see for example Maron et al., (2019); Xu et al., (2018); Morris et al., (2019)).
Learning rate is “the single most important hyper-parameter” (Bengio, 2012) in training neural networks.
 The algorithm accepts the initialized model parameters θ0, step size h, pre-conditioner m, and momentum noise Dc.1: procedure atmc training(θ0, h,m,D) 2: p0 ← 0 3: ξ0 ← 0 4: while t < T do 5: Gt ← minibatch gradient(θt) 6: ηt ← random normal() 7: αt ← max(D − ξt, 0) 8: βt ← αt + ξt 9: pt+h ← eβth  pt − expβth−1βt Gt + √ exp2βth−1 βt αt ηt 10: θt+h ← θt + hpt+hm 11: ξt+h ← ξt + h  p2t+h m − 1}
 The "Dark knowledge" is the knowledgeencoded by the relative probabilities of the incorrect outputs.
 Inducing-point methods are further improved in several directions, such as generic inference for non-Gaussian likelihoods (Sheth et al., 2015; Dezfouli & Bonilla, 2015; Krauth et al., 2016; Hensman et al., 2015), inter-domain and subspace inducing points (Hensman et al., 2017; Panos et al., 2018), and decoupled approximation with two different sets of inducing points (Cheng & Boots, 2017; Salimbeni et al., 2018).
 Our contribution can be considered as follows:
 Thus we will need a new architecture to handle such constraints.
 In other words, the standard BN, while performing normalization with respect to the mean and the variance, will not ensure the features of different layers to have similar distributions.
 Recently, Zhang et al., (2018) and Zhou et al., (2018b) develop more efficient stochastic cubic regularization variants, which further reduce the stochastic second-order oracle complexity to Õ(n2/3/ 1.5) at the cost of increasing the stochastic first-order oracle complexity to Õ(n2/3/ 2.5).
 To exploit such temporal relationships between tasks, we need a model that does not perform static knowledge transfer between two tasks (Figure 1a), but dynamically changes the knowledge transfer amount and direction at each timestep, and also transfers knowledge across timesteps (Figure 1b).
In this paper, we study why the learning rate warm-up stage is essential in the optimization of the Post-LN Transformer and find it is closely related to the position of the layer normalization.
 In light of this, we try to propose a theoretically justified normalization approach for accelerating training deep neural networks, so that we can continuously further algorithmic progress.
 The estimated conditional entropy is then used to update the weights of the encoder fθ so that the updated representations increase the approximated conditional entropy.
 Also, the source policies are neither trained nor hand-engineered for the target environment instance, and therefore not guaranteed to work optimally and may even fail (Chen et al., 2018).
 These metrics are typically simple, elementwise functions such as L1 or L2 distances.
 The first component is virtual supernode (Li et al., 2017; Gilmer et al., 2017), which communicates with all nodes in the graph and promotes the remote message passing.
 We find that this explains problems previously reported in the literature such as the difficulty in optimizing hardnegative triplets (Harwood et al., 2017).
 The key insight of our work is that current models use attention mechanisms conditioned on the hidden features of recurrent modules such as LSTMs, which leads to effective models with high accuracy but entangle grounding and decoding.
 The method is general for enforcing arbitrary linear combinations of differential operators on these fields, which encompasses physical constraints from a broad range of important scientific and engineering systems.
 (b) There is an unrevealed interplay among DP preservation, adversarial learning, and robustness bounds.
Percolation describes the phase transition of a physical system when one or more of its properties change abruptly after a slight change in controlling variables (e.g, temperature, pressure, or others) (Broadbent & Hammersley, 1957).
 For example, in machine translation, the input process (or the observation process) is sentence in one language and the output process (or the state process) is sentence in another language.
Their model achieved 77.46% accuracy on test data which had the same distribution as the training data.
 First, inferring the novelty for the true state given only the partial observations still remains an open problem.
 VggNet (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) and DropIn (Smith et al., 2016) added new layers into shallower DNNs; Network Morphism (Wei et al., 2016; 2017; Chen et al., 2015) morphed each layer to multiple layers to increase the depth meanwhile preserving the function of the shallower net.
 In each iteration, an architecture is proposed by a controller, and then trained and evaluated.
Training a pipeline that includes a non-differentiable selection/gather operation is non-trivial.
 One of such questions is, why should Gaussian noise be used for randomized smoothing to certify `2-normed robustness, and is Gaussian mechanism the best option? Another important question is regarding the generalizability of this method to other norms, especially the `∞ norm.
Contributions
 Examples include regularization based methods (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Zenke et al., 2017), knowledge transfer based methods (Rusu et al., 2016), episodic memory based methods (Lopez-Paz et al., 2017; Chaudhry et al., 2018b; Riemer et al., 2018).
 If the angle between the reference gradient and the current gradient computed on the new task is obtuse, the current gradient is projected to be perpendicular to the reference gradient.
 Moreover, since the scaling transformation is rarely perfect in practice (due to changing view angle or numerical discretization), one needs to quantify and promote the deformation robustness of the equivariant representation (i.g,, is the model still “approximately” equivariant if the scaling transformation is “contaminated” by a nuisance input deformation), which, to the best of our knowledge, has yet been studied in prior works.
 The pruned ConvNets is generated by element-wise multiplication between the mask vector and filters/BN parameters, in which filters/BN parameters with all zero are removed from the ConvNets.
The development of deep learning technologies brings a significant improvement of OD flow prediction by extracting non-linear latent structures that cannot be easily covered by feature engineering. (Xingjian et al., 2015; Ke et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018).
 We call this phenomena ”information extraction-compression process”(information E-C process).
 This goal can be achieved by adaptively setting the dropout probability for each input, such that some of the neurons are retained with high probability only for certain types of inputs and tasks.
 Despite a stable version – k-means++ (Arthur & Vassilvitskii, 2007) gives a more stable initialization, fundamentally it is still non-trivial to extend k-means in clustering data samples of non-convex shape.
 This drawback is because popular conditioning methods for flow-based models, such as in (Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018), make use of the latent code for conditioning and introduce independent parameters for different class categories.
 Note that a continuous representation x̃ ∈ Rn (e.g, Snell et al., (2017)) uses 32n bits per datapoint.
 Second, the quantization technique does not change the neural network architectures.
 Empirical experiments suggest that the Wasserstein distance is a more sensible measure for differentiating probability measures supported in low-dimensional manifolds.
Many works have been applied to single-aspect sentiment analysis for reviews, where the ambiguity of a justification is minimal.
 Compared with case1 and case2, these key words or phrases are relatively hard to capture by straightforward or shallow models.
 This means that the objective, denoted by V (f, g), may not be a convex function when fixing f and not a concave function when fixing g.
Meanwhile, both types of solutions model the natural progression of disease using observations of the targeted variables only.
An important question is whether supervised learning, where a potentially high-dimensional computed outcome is compared to a target outcome of equal dimensionality, is a biologically plausible paradigm for animal learning (Marblestone et al., 2016): while examples of imitation learning exist, most animal learning would be classified as either unsupervised, self-supervised or of a reinforcement learning nature.
1 The approximability gap can also be observed empirically on (semi-) randomly generated piecewise linear dynamics with a decent chance.
 One main component of unpaired I2I is a cross-cycle consistency constraint, where the network generates an intermediate output by swapping the styles of a pair of images, then swaps the style between the intermediate output again to reconstruct the original images.
 Figure 1 presents an example in which this is visible: in the caption generated using softmax (top), the model attends to the whole image at every time step, leading to a repetition of “bowl of fruit.” This undesirable behaviour is eliminated by using our alternative solutions: sparsemax (middle) and the newly proposed TVMAX (bottom).
 The indirect approach utilizes a neural network as a component in the solution.
 If the adversarial examples distort temporal dependency of voice data, they can be easily detected.
 Further, in NLP tasks such as machine translation with Adam, typically a linear warmup is followed by polynomial decay, e.g, the Transformer network (Vaswani et al., (2017)) uses a linear warmup followed by an inverse square root decay.
 Overall, the existing sampling techniques for GNNs work well in practice.
 The exploring space faces exponentially exploding number of possible configurations as dimensions are added into the decision making.
 At a branched layer, we decompose each filter over a small set of domain-specific basis elements to model intrinsic domain characteristics, while enforcing shared cross-domain coefficients to align invariant semantics.
 It has been shown in experiments Antoniou et al., (2017) that GAN-based methods have indeed significantly boosted the performance of classifiers under limited data through automatic augmentation, but applications into other tasks are yet to be explored.
 Indeed, as the training labels themselves do not accurately reflect the event location, focusing on replicating these unreliable patterns is incompatible with the overall objective of learning the actual ground-truth.
 For non-spectral methods, the convolution operation is directly performed in the graph domain, aggregating information only from the neighbors of a node (Duvenaud et al., 2015; Atwood & Towsley, 2016).
Although many of them are theoretically motivated with cross-domain generalization bounds, they either use ad-hoc aggregation rules when developing actual algorithms (Zhao et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018) or lack finite-sample analysis (Mansour et al., 2009b;c; Hoffman et al., 2018a).
XLDA can be used with both pretrained and randomly initialized models without needing to explicitly further align the embeddings.
Recently, ZO optimization has attracted increasing attention in solving ML/DL problems.
 By cutting off certain connection in the network, we make sure that new tasks can take advantage of previously learned features but cause no interference in the pathways of the previously learned tasks.
To validate the efficiency of the proposed approach, we have tested it on several popular NLP tasks.
 A single head in a multi-head attention layer, computes self attention between the tokens in the input sequence, which it then uses to compute a weighted average of embeddings for each token.
 The Global Style Token (GST) system (Wang et al., 2018) uses a modified attention-based reference encoder to transfer global style properties to arbitrary text, and Ma et al., (2019) use an adversarial objective to disentangle style from text.
 Scheduled Sampling has also been used to get better performance in other tasks such as video prediction (Finn et al., 2016), knowledge base completion (Miwa and Bansal, 2016) and piano music transcription (Sigtia et al., 2016).
 Thus, analogy-based word attribute transfer requires explicit knowledge of word attributes, such as king is male, queen is female, and is has no gender attribute.
In this work, we perform a rigorous theoretical and empirical study of the convergence of optimization methods under such heavy-tailed noise.
By learning a compressed, useful, latent space representation, this enormous space of molecules can be embedded in a simpler latent space that is easier to search Kusner et al., (2017).
 Based on the framework, we propose a novel distillation method specifically for Transformer-based models (Vaswani et al., 2017), and use BERT as an example to investigate the KD methods for large scale PLMs.
 For example, while there is a substantial body of work on Bayesian optimization over Euclidean spaces, using Bayesian optimization for NAS has so far required specifying a distance function between neuralarchitectures, in order to define a surrogate model.
Overall, we systematically analyze the model size and accuracy trade-offs considering both weight precision values and the number of channels for various modern networks architectures (variants of1Width-multiplier grows or shrinks the number of channels across the layers with identical proportion for a certain network, e.g, grow the number of channels for all the layers by 2×.
 The reason is that while there could be many ways to compress the information captured in the data, allowing good enough approximations, there is no reason to a priori assume that such a representation is interpretable and disentangled in the sense that by manipulating certain dimensions of the representation one can control attributes of choice, say the pose of a face, while keeping other attributes unchanged.
 Considering the prohibitively long training time and advanced hardware requirements in training large scale flow models such as (Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018), we believe that it is worth exploring the application of flows in the low dimensional representation spaces rather than for the original data.
 (3) Interpolated sequences as subgoals for policy training through reinforcement learning (Peng et al., 2018).
 However, many basic vision tasks rely more on basic feature information instead of the high-level abstract features.
Contributions.
In recent years, an increasing number of graph generative models based on machine learning have been proposed.
 This complexity leads us to the second problem: when different models might interact in complex pipelines, the construction of the appropriate confidence measures can be a challenging task.
 The directions of improving such methods would be more clear if some key questions had been answered: 1) How far is the accuracy of found architecture from the best one within search space? 2) Could the best architecture be stably found in multiple runs of search process? 3) How does weight sharing affect the accuracy and stability of the found architecture?In this paper, we answer the above-mentioned questions using comprehensive experiments and analysis.
In this work, we use Core-set selection (Agarwal et al., 2005) to sub-sample a large batch to produce a smaller batch.
 For this purpose, we divide the convolution operation into“embedding” and “transformation” (see fig.  9 in Appendix).
Very recently, the universal self-attention network (Dehghani et al., 2019) has been shown to be very powerful in NLP tasks such as question answering, machine translation and language modeling.
 Alternatively, researchers in practice typically start from training a big model using common task datasets like ImageNet, and then prune or distill such big models to small ones without sacrificing too much of the performance (Jaderberg et al., 2014; Han et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017; Zhang et al.,2016; Li et al., 2017; Abbasi-Asl & Yu, 2017; Yang et al., 2018; Arora et al., 2018).
 This requires more flexible strategies in dynamically handling the network width and depth, according to the scale of dataset.
 SAUNA keeps transitions where there is either strong correlation or lack of fit between V and the returns, while avoiding the learning signals to be diluted by the dropped out samples.
 This makes an orthographic word functioning as a phrase, clause or sentenceBinyam Ephrem Seyoum (2018).
There are serious issues when trying to manually define a reward signal in real-world tasks.
 Whilst in the single-head scenario, the task identifier is unknown, in that case we have Y = ∪Ni=1Yi with N the number of tasks learned so far.
 Photon pairs are collected, identified, processed, and finally reconstructed to obtain medical images.
 On the contrary, invertible flow-based statistical models (Dinh et al., 2015; Kobyzev et al., 2019) do not require training for their decoders because the decoders are simply the inverse mapping of the encoders and are known for good generation performances in image generation (Dinh et al., 2017; Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018).
 This discussion raises a controversial question: which is better, a fat model with smaller bit width or a slim model with larger bit width? Answering this question requires a metric that fairly measures the effects of both pruning and quantization.
 Note that the full gradient requires an additional loss term which is independent of the architecture, and so our attention is focused on Jk.
 This is similar to the strategy used to model activation distributions in VAE (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and VIB (Alemi et al., 2017).
 Consider the following utterance :(1) You’re standing on my foot.
 For aligning feature distributions across domains, mainly two strategies have been substantially explored.
 For example, if the observed transformations are image rotations, the transformation can be represented by elements on the unit circle S1.
 In its absence, we have little choice but to find an appropriate algorithm via trial-and-error.
The contribution and structure of this paper is as follows.
In this work, we introduce the Mixture-of-Experts Similarity Variational Autoencoder (MoE-SimVAE), a new deep architecture that performs similarity-based representation learning, clustering of the data and generation of data from each specific data mode.
 Deep mutual learning (DML) (Zhang et al., 2018) and on-the-fly native ensemble (ONE) (Lan et al., 2018) are the representative online distillation methods that show appealing results in the image classification tasks.
 By applying suchdisentanglement, we are able to reveal the relation between standard generalization and adversarial robustness of the deep learning model in a relatively general setting.
 The main challenges of GDA are: (1) SLD exists between the source and target domain, which hampers the effectiveness of mainstream domain adaptation methods that only minimize SFD, (2) aligning the conditional feature distributions (p(x|y), q(x|y)) is difficult in the presence of SLD, and (3) when the data in one or both of the domains are unequally distributed across different categories, it is difficult to train an unbiased classifier.
 However, not much has been done in the same direction by the statistical relational learning community.
• The mechanism designer may not possess any ground truth samples.
 There are usually three ways to introduce randomness according to the time of adding noise: output perturbation, objective perturbation and gradient perturbation.
 In the direct approach, outputs of the network represent the parameters of the output distribution for either discrete (Niculescu-Mizil & Caruana, 2005) or continuous (Nix & Weigend, 1994) distributions.
 Specifically, even though ALE is fast at runtime, training an agent on one game takes approximately one week on one GPU and thus the equivalent of more than one year to train on all 61 Atari games.
 This problem is exacerbated in the dose-response setting in which the number of counterfactuals is no longer even finite.
 This is a daunting endeavor.
 Their method overall improves the classification accuracy, but at an additional computational cost; it is a transductive method, i.g,, instead of learning a parametric classifier, the large-scale collection is still necessary at inference.
 In fact, in reinforcement learning, the non-stationary sampling process with the environment leads to the large variance of existing methods on the estimate of policy gradient, which results in poor sample efficiency (Papini et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018).
 Transferring all user embeddings to devices during FL training is prohibitively resource-expensive (in terms of communication and storage on user devices) and does not preserve user privacy.
We propose a regularization method for learning policies that are robust to irrelevant visual changes in the environment.
 The inner maximization problem is commonly solved by projected gradient descent (PGD).
 However, In most practical case, Bayer pattern decides that one pixel only collect intensity for one color channel, and the left channels are usually upscaled by demosaicing.
There is ample research into different techniques for finding saliency maps (see e.g, Zeiler & Fergus, 2014; Springenberg et al., 2014; Bach et al., 2015; Ribeiro et al., 2016; Shrikumar et al., 2017; Selvaraju et al., 2017; Zintgraf et al., 2017; Fong & Vedaldi, 2017).
Different from the current keypoint detection tasks, we aim to solve the problem of non-fixed number of keypoint detection.
The focus of this work is on the momentum parameter and how we can boost the performance of training methods with a simple technique.
We empirically found that although both of these transforms do not require any learnable parameters at all, they show the sufficient ability to capture the cross-channel correlations.
 We tackle several key issues that have not been addressed so far by state-of-the-art AL methods.
Specifically, we propose to decouple the representations into different semantic levels in the Laplacian domain.
 2) application restriction: they only handle the hand-craft feature data, but cannon deal with raw image or audio data, or requires pre-processing techniques that may lost key information of the raw data before learning the representation.
 In a nutshell, the RPGAN generator contains several instances of the corresponding layer.
 Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) (Arjovsky et al., 2017) minimize the 1-Wasserstein distance over the l2-metric, instead, resulting in more robust training.
 Recently, the self-attention mechanism as shown in fig.  1(b) has been proposed by the seminal work of Transformer (Vaswani et al., (2017)) to get rid of the limitation of sequential processing, accelerating the training time substantially and improving the performance significantly on seq-to-seq tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because the relevance between each two time stamps is captured explicitly.
 This is the core idea behind these reshaping reward based approaches.
 FPN still has room for improvement.
 Fundamental investigations on DNN training mechanisms using fewer quantization bits have also been actively reported to improve quantization quality (Li et al., 2017).
 Still, due to memory constraints the search has to be performed on 8 cells, which are then stacked 20 times for the final architecture.
 However, the information about the logits absolute values is lost due to this normalization.
 In contrast to RISE, DISE learns representations for inputs and hidden states that are enriched with time information and thus allow the framework to model arbitrary future time steps by effectively skipping over missing values, rather than imputing them.
 Given the fact that DNNs enable the agent to make use of nonlinear models with less domain knowledge, existing work (Riquelme et al., 2018; Zahavy and Mannor, 2019) focuses on the idea called neural-linear bandit.
 For example, they need to explore different deep neural network (DNN) structures (such as adding/deleting a layer) or different hyperparameters (such as learning rates and dropout rates), which all lead to increased testing cost.
 INNs are neural networks which are by construction bijective, efficiently invertible, and have a tractable Jacobian determinant.
 Therefore, synthetic objects may look realistic, but they are not novel in concept in fact.
 We introduce these methods as follows.
 Generally speak-ing, most current approaches include a set of simplifications, such as considering separate classifiers for each new task, referred to as multi-head classifiers.
Acknowledging the difficulty in learning disentangled representation, we provide a detailed explanation of the seemingly contradictory behaviors of the total correlations of sampled and mean representation in previous works on TC penalizing strategy.
 (2) Good semi-supervised learning results and good generative performance can not be obtained at the same time.
 First, regularization-based approaches reduce forgetting by restricting the updates in parameters that were important for previous tasks (Kirkpatrick et al., 2016; Aljundi et al., 2018; Chaudhry et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2018).
 The current state-of-the-art approaches extend the β-VAE with augmented objective function to reduce this trade-off Burgess et al., (2017); Kim & Mnih (2018); Chen et al., (2018); Kumar et al., (2017).
 When exact states are available during training but not deployment, we can make use of information asymmetric actor-critic methods (Pinto et al., 2018; Schwab et al., 2019) to train the critic faster via access to the state while providing only images for the actor.
To overcome these two problems we propose 1) the window-based representation function and 2) the wave2wave iterative back-translation model in this paper.
 One modification of this approach is to subsample the constraints and then project onto the sampled set (see Nedić (2011); Polyak (2001); Wang & Bertsekas (2013); Wang et al., (2015)).
 Interestingly, this algorithmic procedure induces a datadependent regularizer that, in expectation, equals weighted trace-norm – a complexity measure that enjoys strong generalization guarantees (Foygel et al., 2011).
 We formulate the scorer network as a function of the current training examples only, making it possible to re-use the model architecture which is designed and trained for the main task.
 Zhang et al., (2018) proposed a GAN-based approach, Meta-GAN, that helps making it easier for FSL models to learn better decision boundaries between different classes.
 Starting from a pre-trained English LM, we learn the target language specific parameters (i.g,, word embeddings), while keeping the encoder layers of the pre-trained English LM fixed.
 Unsurprisingly, we find that agents that are trained on template-based commands do not cope well with the diversity and variation of natural keyboard-typed language.
 The purpose of this score is to measure the accuracy of an embedding in reflecting the overall placement of the clusters of points relative to their original representation in high-dimension.
 However, as Dinh et al., (2017) remarked, current flatness measures—which are based only on the Hessian of the loss function—cannottheoretically be related to generalization: For deep neural networks with ReLU activation functions, there are layer-wise reparameterizations that leave the network function unchanged (hence, also the generalization performance), but change any measure derived only from the loss Hessian.
 Thus, by increasing the number of effective training examples, we can improve accuracy while maintaining the same privacy guarantees.
 In an important contribution, Mossel et al., (2015) show that under certain conditions on the social network, in the limit T → ∞ (number of periods) and n → ∞ (number of agents), agents will converge and will agree on the correct state of the world.
To this end, we propose Batch Meta Reinforcement Learning (BMRL) as a formalization of pre-training in RL from only existing and observational data.
For video models, the number of parameters is typically significantly higher which makes their interpretability all the more pressing.
In general, the behavior of deep nets is not well specified when the test queries are out-of-distribution.
 An important step in this process is to classify DNA fragments into various groups at different taxonomic ranks.
 We perform semi-supervised node classification and OOD detection based on GNNs.
 This may be more effective in terms of choosing the right candidate and mitigating some of the errors arising from auto-regressive decoding in the generator.
 However, it is often hard to discover causal structure in realistic settings.
same order of convergence rate as vanilla SGD for both convex and non-convex problems if the number of iterations is large (Wangni et al., 2018; Stich et al., 2018; Alistarh et al., 2018; Jiang & Agrawal, 2018; Karimireddy et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2019).
 Not being able to explicitly represent the policy makes it hard to transfer the learned policy to other tasks or to initialize agents with an existing better-than-random policy.
 Asymptotic constraints not only provide more information about the expression, leading to better extrapolation, but also constrain the search in the desired semantic subspace, making the search more tractable in much larger space.
 Therefore, reducing the data dimension may help improve the robustness of neural networks.
However, as illustrated by Figure 1, this line of work has also shown that the optimal divergence can vary depending on tasks and an undesired divergence objective can lead to mediocre performance(Li & Turner, 2016; Depeweg et al., 2016).
Using the OE technique, our main contribution is threefold:
 Some more recent results have shown that when models can fit the data completely while being strongly convex, convergence without a noise floor is possible without decaying the learning rate (Schmidt & Roux, 2013; Ma et al., 2017; Bassily et al., 2018; Vaswani et al., 2018).
 To emphasize the use of better data augmentation in consistency training, we name our method Unsupervised Data Augmentation or UDA.
 By carefully combining these two ideas,we create a stochastic algorithm that provably converges fast in the convex setting and that obtains state-of-the-art results with neural networks.
 However, a consistent evaluation framework is still missing and the performance is usually reported on non-standard splits and with varying metrics, making reproduction and quick research iteration difficult.
 Although these methods can scale to large networks, certifying robustness with probability close to 1 often requires generating a large number of noisy samples around the input which leads to high test-time computational complexity.
Here we define a multi-task architecture as a single network that supports separate outputs for multiple tasks.
Adapt-to-Learn is inspired by the fact that combined adaptation of behaviors and learning through experience is a primary mechanism of learning in biological creatures (Krakauer & Mazzoni, 2011; Fryling et al., 2011).
 They are highly-interpretable in their basic form (e.g, by tracking decision nodes and edges) and various interpretability techniques have been shown to be effective for their ensemble form, e.g, (Lundberg et al., 2018).
 In this regard,we call the proposed method Neural Operator Search (NOS).
 As discussed in depth in the following section, the approaches of semi-supervised and active learning can be complementary and used in conjunction to help solve the problem of costly in labels.
 Thus, there seems to be a strong theoretical connection between LSTMs and the counter automata.
 In this paper, we focus on the graph classification problem.
 Importantly, the elephant, the lightning condition, and the location are causes of the presented view in the photo.
 The goal is to optimize the parameters of the student in order to produce the function represented by the teacher.
 We show that learning the gradient, rather than the potential itself, is important for themixing of the Langevin dynamics towards the target Gibbs distribution.
 Xie et al., (2018) and Jonathan Tompson (2017) developed deep learning models in the context of fluid flow animation, where physical consistency is less critical.
 In most traditional quantization works, the objective in the quantization procedures is to minimize the reconstruction error for the datapoints to be searched.
 On the other hand, some studies were also verified on real-world noisy datasets, e.g, on WebVision (Li et al., 2017a), Clothing-1M (Xiao et al., 2015), Fine-grained Images (Krause et al., 2016), and Instagram hashtags (Mahajan et al., 2018), where the images are automatically tagged with noisy labels according to their surrounding texts.
 However, current methods use a simplified version of FREEBASE where the non-binary relations are converted to binary ones (defined on exactly two entities).
 The latter two approaches have scaled well to ImageNet-1k.
 In other words, gradients guide the network to learn new information that was not learned from data that it has seen so far but is presented in the current input.
 For instance, the designers of a recommendation system may want to make recommendations independent of a user’s demographic information or location.
 For instance, Lee et al., (2018) incorporates aspects of “theory of mind” (Premack & Woodruff, 1978) in question asking by simulating potential answers to the questions, but the approach relies on imperfect agents for natural language understanding which may lead to error propagation.
 Given a paragraph, the system aims to automatically edit sentences into a desired style, while keeping the edited section topically coherent with its surrounding context.
 The second, CoachReg, supposes that coordinating agents individually recognize different situations and synchronously use different subpolicies to react to them.
 On the other hand, it was shown in Kolter & Wong (2018); Raghunathan et al., (2018); Gowal et al., (2018); Mirman et al., (2018); Dvijotham et al., (2018a) that by incorporating the relaxed but computationally efficient verification methods into the training process, the learnt model yields strengthened robustness with certificate.
 Attributes of neighbors at different scales can be considered separately (multi-scale) or pooled in some way (e.g, weighted average).
 To optimize precision, we attempt to minimize KL-divergence in the reverse order, that is, DKL(p(yt|y<t,x)‖q(yt|y<t,x)).
Intuition.
 2) how to jointly learn both local and global information for translation.
 TPO is a variation of the policy iteration method 35, 44, 42, 1.
conCNN is inspired by our observation that probabilistic graphical models, in particular, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) have been successful in enhancing the accuracy of low level computer vision tasks (Ladicky et al., 2009; Zheng et al., 2015; Rabinovich et al., 2007; Krähenbühl & Koltun, 2011) such as image segmentation or object detection.
 For instance, Miwa & Bansal (2016) propose a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based joint model that uses a bidirectional long-short term memory network (BiLSTM) to model the entities and a tree-LSTM to model the relations between entities; Li et al., (2017) propose a similar model for biomedical text.
 One category of methods justify a prediction decision by assigning importance values to reflect the influence of individual pixels or image sub-regions on the final classification.
 The key contributions are listed as follows:
 However, reconstructing the original input from the representation is computationally expensive.
 The contribution of each feature to the final decision output can simply be analyzed by examining the corresponding weight parameters.
 In current approaches, the pruning process consists of the following steps: train CNN, remove redundant filters and retrains the network to preserve the original accuracy.
 Black-box score-based attacks (Chen et al., 2017; Ilyas et al., 2018a;b) do not need pre-trained models, they access the output probabilities of the attacked model to generate adversarial examples iteratively.
Let us motivate CNC through a simple example.
 2) Increasing the length of position embedding and re-pretraining the BERT from scratch.
In this paper, we focus on the more realistic C-JPG SR problem.
 Our approach to construct a sampler is straightforward: assuming we have a density estimator that can be efficiently trained and evaluated, we learn a sampler by forcing its generated density to be the same as the input data density via minimizing their Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.
1 Another key issue is diversity.
 Next, as the goal is to learn general computation, the network will operate on raw numbers: taking as input numbers, or distributions over sets of numbers that it may not have even seen in training.
 We build upon a simple yet recurring observation (Osband et al., 2013; Kahn et al., 2017; Choudhury et al., 2018): while solving the belief MDP may be hard, solving individual latent MDPs is much more tractable.
 However, in some applications, the presence of these bad outliers is more catastrophic than slight imperfections in modeling the most dense regions of the space.
Despite its high potential, for the TSP, existing ML based methods are still in its infancy, struggling to solve instances with more than 100 cities, leaving much room for further improvement compared with traditional methods.
 Figure 1 illustrates this concept, where the batch only covers a subset of possible policies.
 As in the PN, our SPE assumes each class can be characterized by a prototype in the embedding space and an instance is classified based on its proximity to a prototype.
 More recently, Ye et al., (2018b)1 Our code and models can be found in .presented a relatively denser reward function which is based on the bounding box of the target object from robot’s detection system, the reward is still not defined among the situations that the target object is not detected.
 Furthermore, there are multiple tasks where the input data is too long and must be truncated before being processed (Lee & Hsiang, 2019).
 However, on-chip training requires a large number of writes to the memory, and RRAM writes cost significantly more energy than reads (e.g, 10.9 pJ/bit versus 1.76 pJ/bit (Wu et al., 2019)).
In this work, we extend the formulation of the level set method.
 Recent techniques for learning contextual embeddings (McCann et al., 2017; Peters et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2018; 2019; Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019) provide ways to compute representations of tokens based on their surrounding context, and have shown significant accuracy improvements in downstream tasks, even with only a small number of task-specific parameters.
 In a user study, participants favored the proposed approach over three baselines (LIME, SmoothGrad and VarGrad) with NormLIME receiving 30% more votes than all the baselines combined.
 Previous successes on SAT problems argued for the power of GNN, which can handle NP-complete problems (Selsam et al., 2019; Amizadeh et al., 2019), but no successes have been reported for solving semi-decidable predicate logic problems via GNN.
 More recently, deep networks have been used to categorize samples (Weinshall et al., (2018)) and variations on the pace with which these samples were shown to deep networks were analyzed in-depth (Hacohen & Weinshall (2019)).
 They also provide an information rich latent space suitable for many applications.
 On the other hand, training on short trajectories makes the policy short-sighted.
 Nevertheless, there are two issues that can harm the effectiveness of multi-head attention mechanism for sequence learning.
 In those domains, representation based on a fixed key-point ordering has allowed for cutting edge work across numerous tasks with a variety of approaches and architectures (Antonakos et al., 2015; Cootes et al., 2001; Akhter et al., 2012; Joo et al., 2015; Simon et al., 2017).
 Pruned or compressed models are frequently favored for deploying deep neural networks onto devices because reducing the number of network weights lowers energy consumption, memory footprint, and latency (Reagen et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Theis et al., 2018; Kalchbrenner et al., 2018; Valin & Skoglund, 2018).
 However, many of these methods still require a predefined hierarchical policy structure (e.g, the number of sub-policies), or need some degree of task-specific knowledge (e.g, hand-crafted reward function).
In this vein, here we focus on learning pivot rules for the simplex algorithm for solving LP instances.
 Bengio (2017) proposed as a prior (the consciousness prior) that the dependency between high-level variables (such as those describing actions, states and their changes) be represented by a sparse factor graph, i.g,, with few high-level variables at a time interacting closely, and inference performed sequentially using attention mechanisms to select a few relevant variables at each step.
 Although each view could individually be used for learning tasks, exploiting information from all views together could improve the learning quality (Pu et al., 2016; Liu & Tuzel, 2016; Chen & Denoyer, 2017).
 Some latest works propose the pointer network (Vinyals et al., 2015b) and utilize the attention mechanism with reinforcement learning (Nazari et al., 2018; Kool et al., 2019) to solve the TSP and the routing problems respectively.
 Another challenge results from the similarity between some attributes such as “huge” and “big”.
 The results show that the attention mechanism in text classification does not have an impact on the performance, thus, making inferences about interpretability of attention in these models might not be accurate.
 A network trained with adversarial examples tends to have a lower natural accuracy than a naturally trained network.
 While enjoying this assumption that majority tends to be correct, this claim is questionable in settings where special knowledge is needed to infer the truth, but it is owned by few individuals when they are not widely shared (Chen et al., 2004; Simmons et al., 2010; Prelec et al., 2017).
Standard zeroth order algorithms construct pseudo-gradients by sampling some perturbed points from a Gaussian distribution with an isotropic covariance (e.g, Nesterov & Spokoiny (2017); Duchi et al., (2012) or uniformly from a unit sphere (e.g, Flaxman et al., (2005); Duchi et al., (2012); Shamir (2017)).
Since the verification applications like person re-identification (re-ID) (Luo et al., (2019)) usually train metric learning models along with classification, recent work (Yang et al., (2019)) starts to leverage the classification activation map to help improve the overall performance, but the activation map of metric learning is still not well explored.
 Whereafter, many works (Karpov et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019) tried to employ Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), which is a more powerful Sequence-toSequence(Seq2Seq) model, to improve prediction accuracy in retrosynthesis.
 As an example, in a clinical context, one word might correspond to “low blood pressure reading”; for a given subject, we can count how many such readings the subject has had recorded in the past.
 A landmark that fires on the background is a wasted landmark, as the background is constantly changing, and yields little information regarding the pose of our foreground object of interest.
 Moreover, even with exact inference, Bayesian credible intervals generally do not guarantee frequentist coverage (Bayarri & Berger (2004)).
Message function designs focus on the choices of functions defined over the interaction between nodes or variables.
 We refer to these negative examples as hard-negative examples for the rest of this paper.
 Recent work (Kraska et al., 2018; Mitzenmacher, 2018) has proposed to improve the performance of standard Bloom filter by incorporating a machine learning model.
An obvious solution is to minimize the number of model parameters while maximizing the model’s utility.
To cope with these limitations, graph coarsening (pooling) methods have been proposed to reduce graph size and enable long-distance interaction between nodes.
 The generator should pay more attention to some particular areas rather than the whole image.
 In our universe, an adversary is given a sample x and wishes to find a transformation parameterized by θ ∈ Θ with small norm such that F (τ(x, θ)) 6= F (x) (we consider untargeted attacks, but our ideas extend to targeted attacks as well)1.
Planning algorithms can achieve much better exploration performance than random walk by taking search history into account (Lavalle, 1998).
 As a timely example, the GPT-2 model (Radford et al., 2019), the object of much recent attention for its seemingly coherent and on-topic generations, suffers a dramatic degradation in its entropy rate, from 23.7 to 61.2.
 Assuming that a base network has already been trained for element-based recognition using class labels, we define the “discriminability” of one sample by how difficult it is for the network to discriminate its class.
 Second, the conventional perturbation schemes highly suffer from local noise and, thus, fuse maps from a con-siderable number of perturbations for a reliable explanation.
In this paper, we propose Independence-aware Advantage Estimation (IAE), an algorithm that can identify and utilize the independence property between current action and future states.
 For example, the lottery hypothesis (Frankle & Carbin, 2018) claimed that one over-parameterized CNN always contains unimportant channels that contribute little to the network’s prediction.
 We may optionally have observed input or control signals ut ∈ RU , which drive the system in addition to unobserved stochastic noise.
 Peer loss functions operate under different noise rates without requiring either a priori knowledge of the embedded noise rates, or an estimation procedure.
 This precludes the use of likelihood-based distances such as the KL divergence (Kullback & Leibler, 1951), which we discuss in Section 6.
 To overcome this limitation, we focus on predictive clustering (Blockeel et al., 2017) which combines prediction with clustering.
 For all future references, the first component includes both the source and target vocabulary mapping using a common embedding matrix with a shared vocabulary.
 Such a method would allow us to (1) speed up training networks by storing them in on-chip memory, (2) remove the memory bottleneck and the need for batching, (3) allow more efficient training on distributed systems, and (4) reduce the energy consumption due to the excessive compute and storage requirements of modern DNNs, potentially allowing us to move training to edge devices.
 However, ignorance of some neighbors might lose important structure information, which is the main drawback of all the sampling methods.
 There are also some other variants of adaptive gradient method such as SC-Adagrad / SC-RMSprop (Mukkamala & Hein, 2017), which derives logarithmic regret bounds for strongly convex functions.
 Conversely, for τ > L− 1 2 +c the network output grows at least with rate Lc in expectation, which implies forward/backward explosion for large L.
 Some key differences include:• Siamese trackers are conditioned on the target image, most detectors are not.
Most weight sharing approaches use a continuous relaxation to parameterize the search space (Wu et al., 2018a; Cai et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018b; Xie et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018c).
 Nevertheless, most of these methods either focus on distinguishing the supporting features from background and ignore the discrimination on these features, or are only able to predict discriminative scores on a small part of supporting features.
 Dong et al., (Dong et al., 2016) firstly proposed the seminal CNN model for SR termed as SRCNN, which exploits a shallow convolutional neural network to learn a nonlinear LR-HR mapping in an end-to-end manner and dramatically overshadows conventional methods (Yang et al., 2010; Timofte et al., 2014).
 The reasoning is that there are abundant of useful correlations that exist in natural data, thus it is natural to expect the models could learn to exploit any of them if no preference is given (c.f. Table 7).
 For instance, M(w;λ) is a neural network to solve image classification problem, then λ can be the number of hidden units or network layers.
 Simultaneously, the amount of data produced from MD simulations has been rapidly increasing, in part due to ever increasing computational resources along with more efficient MD software.
 We prove, under mild assumptions, that by minimizing a form of latent reconstruction error, matching the target distribution in the latent space implies matching it in the data space.
 The key in our algorithm is using a continuous cursor that represents the bit quantization scheme for each layer.
 On the other hand, we know a well-trained deep neural networks are robust to random noise (Arjovsky et al., 2017), such as Gaussian noise.
Recently, Wu et al., (2019) showed that graph convolutional networks (GCN) can be broken down into two steps: low-pass filtering and feature learning.
Our proposed method, Meta Gated Recursive Controller Units (METAGROSS), marries the benefits of recursive reasoning with recurrent models.
 Our approach builds on recent work (Mirman et al., 2018; Gowal et al., 2018), which is based on propagating differentiable numerical bounds through DNNs, to include specifications that go beyond adversarial robustness.
1 Moreover, neither of them can capture conditional con-1FID compares image distributions and, as such, should be able to roughly capture the intra-conditioning diversity.
 Kim et al., (2018) builds a network-1Number of channels in a layer.in-network structure for multiple resources.
 Our experiments show that no such architecture exists (Figure 1 and Section 4.3).
 To limit oversmoothing, we use a highly expressive autoregressive model which factorizes the distribution over both the time and frequency dimensions.
When a human recognizes an error made by an agent, the elicited ErrP can be captured through EEG to inform agent about the sub-optimality of the taken action in the particular state.
 On the other hand, graph centrality ignores the node features and might not get the real informative nodes.
 This is in direct contrast to common post-hoc correction methods like the ones proposed in Hardt et al., (2016); Woodworth et al., (2017), where noise is potentially added to the decisions of the best performing sub-population.
 Specifically, when fresh data is unavailable for TSC, we propose to augment the compression set with synthetic data produced by generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014).
 Classically, Akaike’s information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion have been used; nevertheless, they require a considerable computational cost because a likelihood must be calculated for every candidate component number.
 Specifically, S1, S2 and S3 denote business, residential, and recreational areas, respectively, whereas U1, U2, and U3 are their boundaries.
 For instance, the causal structures of the products belonging to the same categories are usually similar.
 However, none of these models incorporate multimodal decoders into their formulations, and therefore do not lead to diverse sampling behavior.
 Such approaches can generate visual scenes with multiple objects, but may have difficulty in generating interacting effects between objects.
 However, these methods are known to become infeasible in high dimensional data sets, because in sufficiently high dimensional spaces, all data points are known to be roughly equidistant and the space around all points will be sparse (5).
 Unlike the vast majority of prior work, we not only consider the correctness of an explainer, but also the consistency and confidence of the generated explanations.
 To make it possible, they provide a ground truth explanation dataset for each image, question and answer pairs, and fine-tune the model to generate explanations in an end-to-end process.
 Some theoretical results further show that it is challenging to achieve adversarially robust generalization.
 The proposed retrospection loss is simple, easy to implement and we empirically show that it works well across multiple tasks, input types and network architectures.
 In our setting, labeling functions enable domain experts to quickly translate domain knowledge of diverse styles into programmatically generated style annotations.
 In triplet loss, a positive pair only interacts with one negative pair.
 Second, they usually have strong assumptions on missingness mechanism (see A.1) such as data is missing completely at random (MCAR) (Yoon et al., 2018).
 By reducing the number of bits representing these data, existing quantization techniques reduce the memory bandwidth considerably.
 These approaches are often incapable of capturing longterm dependencies and produce blurry prediction.
Mostafa & Wang (2019) show that with adaptive sparse training and dynamic reallocation of nonzeros sparsity levels up to 80% can be achieved.
 One approach to deal with such domains is to use a graph to describe the structure of the irregular domain and then apply graphneural networks (GNNs), a flavor of deep learning defined over graph-structured data for various learning tasks.
 Inspired from the recent works by Wan et al., (2018) and Yang et al., (2018), which have shown that modeling feature distribution of a training set improves classification performance, we explore explicit distribution modeling for UDA.
 Thus, there are numerous equivalent points in model space that correspond to a given neural network.
 To show an overview of our result, we provide a simplified version as follows.
The contributions of this paper are the following:
 Particularly, we find the parameter α has influence on the change of relative distance between words.
 Takahashi et al., (2019) introduced the kernel density trick to estimate the KL divergence in ELBO, for their implicit prior.
 However, bounding the Lipschitz constant of the inverse mapping is of major interest, e.g, when reconstructing inputs from noisy or imprecise features.
 This is due to a counter-intuitive phenomenon in high dimensional spaces (Vershynin, 2018) that almost all of the probability mass of standard Gaussian distribution concentrates around the sphere of radius one (and hence “soap bubble” in the title), instead of the center point (which corresponds to the original input).
 Given labels which are in high disagreement, one can either automatically remove them and retrain on the remaining, or send to a human operator for further review.
 Given this, it is helpful to cast the balancing act between fairness and accuracy as a multiobjective optimisation task and look at the fairness-accuracy Pareto front.
 In the task-specific phase, taking advantage of the learned world graph for structured exploration, we efficiently train an HRL model (Taylor & Stone, 2009).
 Variational inference is appealing since it reduces the problem of inference to an optimization problem, minimizing the discrepancy between the true posterior and the variational posterior.
 For example, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) (Kipf & Welling, 2017) only operate on data that are closely connected due to oversmoothing (Li et al., 2018), which indicates the “washing out” of remote nodes’ features via averaging.
 They also make connections of the SHAP procedure with various existing methods including LRP, LIME and DeepLIFT.
 For instance, both (Geirhos et al., 2019; Baker et al., 2018) show that CNNs are trained to be strongly biased towards textures so that CNNs do not distinguish objects contours from other local or even noise edges, thus perform poorly on shape dominating object instances.
 Invariance alone is similarly trivial – any constant function is invariant.
 All potential solutions are tracked to prevent premature convergence on any specific policy commitments.
 Although many traditional approaches, such as random projection (Li et al., 2006), principal component analysis (PCA) (Rahmani & Atia, 2017), manifold learning (Donoho & Grimes, 2003; Hinton & Roweis, 2003) and autoencoder (Vincent et al., 2010), are readily available for handling those data, many of them (Donoho & Grimes, 2003; Hinton & Roweis, 2003; Rahmani & Atia, 2017) are often too computationally costly to scale up to large or high-dimensional data.
 Raghu et al., (2018) have 17,898 septic patients vs. 2,577 for Desautels et al., (2016)).
 However, the local update nature makes these methods sensitive to the starting point.
 Co-teaching is an improvement over MentorNet, it simultaneously maintains two networks which have identical architectures during the training process.
 In Mnih (2013), a post-processing architecture is suggested for incorporating structure into image patch prediction.
 The critical steps will be named key steps in this work, and attacking these steps decreases the cumulative reward that the agent could gather.
 Rather thanioptimizing the kernel directly, the MMD GAN model Li et al., (2017) is proposed in which an embedding function is optimized in conjunction with a fixed user-defined kernel (e.g, RBF Gaussian kernel).
 Ofcourse, not all intersections are decision states.
 One can then classify a sample as being in or out-of distribution based on the maximum prediction probability or the entropy of the output.
 This problem is important in robotic learning because it is better aligned with real world constraints: 1) reward functions are hard to obtain, 2) learned policies from one domain are hard to deploy to different domains due to varying source to target domain statistics, and 3) the target domain dynamics oftentimes changes while executing the learned policy.
 In this work, we define a model-free Temporal-Difference formulation which follows the idea of multi-step learning while remaining off-policy.
 To accomplish this, we integrate a Bayesian changepoint estimation scheme with existing meta-learning approaches, allowing the algorithm to reason about whether or not the task has changed in a time series.
 Our framework characterizes the (epistemic) uncertainty in the agent’s belief of the environment dynamics in a non-parametric way to enable flexibility and expressiveness.
 Data augmentation increases the size and diversity of the training set, and provides a simple way to learn invariances that are challenging to encode architecturally (Cubuk et al., 2017).
 The squashing results in actions persistently taking on their maximal values, so that there is insufficient exploration.
 First, we analyze the extent to which winning tickets are label-dependent by generating “label-agnostic” winning tickets with self-supervised tasks (Gidaris et al., 2018; Doersch & Zisserman, 2017).
 To differentiate from y, we let z represent the low-dimensional vector following the prior distribution.
 These building blocks have been shown, in many cases, to avoid numerical problems during training and, thereby, enable theuse of complex-valued representations.
In this work, we explore compressing the generative model of GANs for more efficient deployment.
 Besides, our masked language/region modeling is conditioned on full observation of image/text, different from other concurrent pre-trained models that apply joint random masking to both modalities.
 In recent years, sparse representation learning is becoming more common for large-scale and highdimensional data.
 In curiosity, agents are typically given rewards corresponding to surprisal of state.
 Theoretical guarantees are only available under restrictive assumptions and for convex objectives, cf. Li et al., (2019b).
Our contributions.
 Mescheder et al., (2018) and Feizi et al., (2017) analyzed the simplest setting: the true data distribution is a single point and a single Gaussian distribution respectively.
 One key line of work in mechanism design deals with principal-agent problems (Holmstrom et al., 1979) holmstrom1982moral,grossman1992analysis,laffont2009theory, relating to a principal in charge of a joint project, whose success depends on the exertion of effort by multiple agents; the principal wishes to incentivize agents to maximally exert costly effort, but cannot observe how much effort any individual agent exerted.
 In order to solve the non-differential issue that arises by the need to handle discrete tokens, reinforcement learning (RL) (Williams, 1992) is adapted by SeqGAN (Yu et al., 2017), RankGAN (Lin et al., 2017), and LeakGAN (Guo et al., 2018).
 Furthermore, the PZSL problem is more challenging in the following aspects.
While autoregressive models seem to work well in the case of small (< 9 heavy atoms) molecules like the ones in the QM9 database, they can be tricky for larger structures as the probability to completely form complex structures, such as rings, decays with the number of involved steps.
 These methods can be used to accurately sample equilibrium states of molecules, but they become computationally expensive for larger ones (Shim & MacKerell, 2011; Ballard et al., 2015; De Vivo et al., 2016).
 This contrasts with many imputation problems which take benefit of stochasticity in missing features.
 An alternative to generating raw data in the form of visually realistic images is to hallucinate examples in a learned feature space (Wang et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2018; Schwartz et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018a; Xian et al., 2019).
 They may assign surprisingly higher likelihoods to out-of-distribution (OoD) samples (Nalisnick et al., 2018; Choi & Jang, 2018).
 Then, the corresponding agent can be trained based on existing training schemes of DRL, e.g, Bello et al., (2016) trained the so-called pointer network for the TSP based on actor-critic training.
 But with so few examples provided and possible differences in the task granularity, few-shot learning algorithms need to be very biased to perform well.
 In addition to maximizing the state entropy, we should be able to control where the policy goes by giving it a goal G that corresponds to a state that it must reach.
 Such description lead us to two observations: the WAE (Tolstikhin et al., 2017) and InfoVAE (Zhao et al., 2017) models are actually maximising a lower bound of the mutual information associated to a generator pθ(x|z) belonging in a certain familyP , the Variational InfoMax (VIM); and given that the capacity of the network is a function of the entropy of the prior p(z), the VIM is the variational expression of the Capacity-Constrained InfoMax (CCIM).
 Data augmentation with local perturbations (crosses) encourages the predictor to fit the local structure of the high density points but compromises the global structure on the tail (solid orange) (Figure 1(b)).
 Unlike approaches based on a Neural Network, Evolutionary approaches are unable to learn patterns to drive the search.
 In order to change the model size, it is necessary to re-train them according to the resources of the target devices.
In this work, we propose a model that performs both of the tasks, which we call as manifold learning and aligning GAN (MLA-GAN).
 For instance, if the application is to organize users’ personal photo gallery, different users might want to sort their personal photo gallery according to the different semantics, such as person identity, place or time.
 Gaussian mixtures still have limited expressiveness and optimization suffers from complications e.g, determining the number of mixture components.
 We demonstrate that the resulting learned “robust representations” (the embeddings learned by adversarially robust neural networks Goodfellow et al., (2015); Madry et al., (2018)) address many of the shortcomings affecting standard learned representations and thereby enable new modes of interaction with inputs via manipulation of salient features.
 Despite the success of these NAS methods on various benchmarks, however, these sampling approaches do not interactively learn the architecture distribution as the search process goes along, which makes the sampling procedure ineffective.
 Therefore, in order to find the optimal path (purple), it is better to exploit the past experiences in diverse directions (gray paths), instead of focusing only on the trajectories with the myopic behavior.
 Extending this line of research, we use the data augmentation framework (Hernández-García & König, 2018) to show that DNNs, despite being trained on augmented data, are not robust to such transformations and the learned representations are even less disentangled than in the input space.
 Thus when encountering a new task, agents can quickly adapt to it with only a small amount of experience.
 Prior to this work, there has been a growing interest in combining causal inference with RL research in the directions of non-model based bandit algorithms (Bareinboim et al., 2015; Forney et al., 2017; Zhang & Bareinboim, 2017; Lee & Bareinboim, 2018; Bradtke & Barto, 1996) and causal discovery with RL (Zhu & Chen, 2019).
2. The inequality constraints of gradients appear to be quite restrictive, requiring that the gradient update can not increase any loss of all previously solved tasks.
 However, it’sunclear how to efficiently incorporate data augmentation in kernel regression, since training time is quadratic in the number of training images.
 The deficiencies of this setting include: 1) Due to delayed reward (ArjonaMedina et al., 2018), it is difficult to find the relationship among the primary objective (killing enemies) and the additional objectives (picking up bullets and medicines).
 However, this does not explain the accuracy loss of differentially private learning on standard benchmark tasks that are known to be relatively simple: MNIST (Yann et al., 1998), FashionMNIST (Xiao et al., 2017), CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009), etc.
 It then uses the sparsified output activation gradients to (potentially more efficiently) compute the input activation and weight gradients.
 In this work, we take a further step by manipulating the distribution of the quantization values so that the entropy H(q) is minimized.
 In addition to image generation, GANs are also widely used in other applications, such as style transfer (Isola et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017) and image processing (Pathak et al., 2016; Ledig et al., 2017; Chang et al., 2017), and generating different types of data, including time series (Luo et al., 2018; Chang et al., 2019), text (Yu et al., 2017; Press et al., 2017), point clouds (Li et al., 2018), voxels (Wu et al., 2016) and tabular data (Park et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019).
On the other end of the spectrum, approaches rooted in policy iteration, such as Dual Policy Iteration (Sun et al., 2018b) do not mimic next step actions of a policy directly, but instead use planning or search over the policy to choose an action distribution to train towards (Silver et al., 2017).
To be specific, the large values of SLW help networks to improve their accuracy.
 However, generalizing to a new context is a challenge for any machine learning model.
 Instead, through our experiments, we claim that attention should be performed on a memory that is also updated (learned) at every time-step.
 We make the observation that the distance between patches centered on neighboring pixels varies smoothly even when the class of the center pixel changes, and thus there are no low-density regions on class boundaries.
 DSGD canbe formulated as follows:wt+1 = wt − ηt p p∑ k=1 gt,k, (2)where p is the number of workers, gt,k is the stochastic gradient or a mini-batch of stochastic gradients calculated by the kth worker at the tth iteration.
 We will call inputs structured if they are concentrated on a lower-dimensional manifold and thus have a lower-dimensional latent representation.
 In the curvature dominated regime, the optimal learning rate is independent of batch size, and the training loss and test accuracy degrade with increasing batch size.
 Thus approximations need to be made that can lead to highly sub-optimal solutions (Koetter & Vontobel, 2003; Feldman et al., 2005; Vontobel & Koetter, 2007).
Our datasets presented in Section 5 seem to be particularly suited for machine learning methods: problems are simple, solutions are long, repetitive and rather predictable for humans.
 The SL leverages knowledge compilation (Darwiche, 2011) to represent arbitrary Boolean constraint as a circuit and uses the latter to measure the mass allocated by the generator to infeasible objects.
 Notably in Rosca et al., (2019), GANs are integrated in a VAE framework by augmenting the L1/L2 data likelihood term in the VAE objective with a GAN discriminator based synthetic likelihood ratio term.
Outlier detection in latent space.
 Then the algorithm can scan a large graph and memorize all necessary local information based on a query pattern graph.
 Our approach has four advantages over prior work:
 The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) (Tibshirani, 1996) is a well-known embedded method, whose objective is to minimize the loss while enforcing an `1 constraint on the weights of the features.
 Our approach, depicted in Figure 1, consists of two steps: 1) ANCHOR: Learn embeddings of a small set of anchor objects that are representative of all objects (§3.1).
 Our work extends existing finite-time analyses for TD learning (Bhandari et al., 2018) and Q-learning (Zou et al., 2019b), from linear function approximation to deepneural network based function approximation.
Given finite training data, many parameter values could equally well explain the observations, and capturing these diverse solutions is crucial for quantifying epistemic uncertainty (Kendall & Gal, 2017).
 Models provide access to ground-truth, analytical gradients of robot physics without the need for sample-based estimation.
 Other work utilizes end-to-end model-free learning with an auxiliary reconstruction signal in an on-policy manner (Jaderberg et al., 2017).
 Such methods typically rely on the trained weights and the CNN structure to find vulnerable patterns that can maximally disturb the normal propagation of activations across the network.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
 Secondly, in many settings, participants are likely to adjust their bidding strategy by using simple learning behaviors based on their experience (Gneezy & Smorodinsky, 2006; Anderson et al., 1998; Nanduri & Das, 2007), so one cannot always assume the Nash equilibrium behaviour as a model of participants’ behavior when designing the contest.
 We use instead weakly annotated images in which a rough region inside each object is marked, cf. the most top left part of Figure 1.
 Thus matching a query that was just entered by the user to the relevant subset of millions ofadvertiser bid phrases in milliseconds is an important research application which forms the focus of this paper.
However, this decoder extension exacerbates a well-known problem in training decoders with a copying facility: a target sequence can be generated in many different ways when an output token can be generated by different means.
 When the batch size is large, one can train with large learning rates, and the role of batch normalization in enhancing the conditioning of the loss landscape becomes apparent.
 This is achieved by going through the estimation of a probability divergence metric such as Kullback-Leibler in (16) or the Person divergence (13).
 The biggest success in unsupervised pre-training was achieved by BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) where the assumption for using causal language modeling was pointed out as unnecessary and it was shown that training deep transformers in a bi-directional fashion to perform the objective of masked language modeling and next sentence prediction could lead to rich and useful representations covering a wide span of natural language understanding downstream tasks.
 The two crates are predicted as road.
However, from the data analytics perspective, anomaly detection is a difficult task due to the following reasons.
 The mutual information can be written as I(S;G) = h(G)\\u2212 h(G|S); therefore maximizing the mutual information is equivalent to maximizing the en-tropy of the goal state while reducing the conditional entropy (conditioned on the goal state).
 Both studies (Wisdom et al., 2017; Le et al., 2019) have shown that carefully-designed deep RNN models outperform the generic RNN model and ISTA (Daubechies et al., 2004) in the task of sequential frame reconstruction.
Structured filters, indirectly defined as a function of the parameters, are theoretically clear and parameter efficient, but constrained.
 In this work, we perform unsupervised feature learning on all data once at the beginning of the active learning pipeline and use the resulting parameters to initialize the model at each active learning cycle.
In this paper, we argue that a complete evaluation method should not only reflect the individual performance of the model on one dataset or multiple datasets but also be able to interpret the model biases, dataset biases, and their correlation (how the difference in the datasets affects the designof the models).
 As the society progressed, sustainability has increasingly become the demand of city development.
 However, it is difficult to get parallel data, and such data needs alignment (which is a arduous process) to get better results.
 Rather, the rendering process must be learned from training data.
 The advantage of this synthesis-based approach is that samples of both domains are obtainable by generation, which contributes to alleviation of the domain bias problem.
 However, 7-FP is a significant improvement over 8 or 12-FX and 8 or 9-FP.
 Applications control the trade-off between dataset size (and, thus, bandwidth) and fidelity, and a careful layout of deltas ensures that data access is efficient at a storage medium level.
 The deeper the network - the stronger the regularization.
An orthogonal approach is to develop a classification network that is inherently robust to input perturbations.
 This is desirable when trying to achieve robustness to irrelevant data variations which are called nuisances (Achille & Soatto, 2018).
 Routing networks lend themselves as a natural choice for learning sharing patterns in multi-task modeling.
 (3) The V1 cells are capable of perceiving local motions.
 A key challenge is to develop a method that can learn from scratch without any supervision.
 More specifically, by considering self-supervised auxiliary tasks (e.g, signal reconstruction), in addition to the sequence-level task, one can learn useful intermediate representations of the data.
 To achieve this, we train the algorithm to perform a transformation that allows it to map any text embedding X onto a random vector Z which satisfies the aforementioned regularity assumptions.
 The processors collect and aggregate stochastic gradients to compute the updated parameter vector.
Since then this analysis has been pushed to a wide range for architectures such as convolutions (Xiao et al., 2018), recurrent networks (Chen et al., 2018; Gilboa et al., 2019), networks with residual connections (Yang & Schoenholz, 2017), networks with quantized activations (Blumenfeld et al., 2019), the spectrum of the fisher (Karakida et al., 2018), a range of activation functions Hayou et al., (2018), and batch normalization (Yang et al., 2019).
 Recent works in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have attempted to make point estimations dependent on the context, for example ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), yet such representations still lack interpretability.
If we restrict ourselves to the linear case, we can compute the optimal autoencoder with a closedform solution (Sperduti, 2013).
 We first parametrize the network using tensor factorization, effectively introducing a latent subspace spanning the weights.
 Bruna et al., (2014) build a multiresolution hierarchy of the graph with agglomerative clustering, based on -covering.
 This causes a lack of focus.
 Secondly, researchers are beginning to consider whether the output (manifolds) of generator networks could be a good model for real word data manifolds, for example, as priors for a variety of inverse problems (Manoel et al., (2017); Huang et al., (2018)).
With the fast-growing size of image data, many images are often \\u201cviewed\\u201d and analyzed more by machines than by humans.
 Video and image imputation have given rise to a large body of literature.
 However, this imposes a strong parametric assumption on the distillation process.
 A RL-free approach to train GANs for text generation without resorting to an explicit neural network as the discriminator, named No Neural Network as the Discriminator GAN (N3DGAN), is proposed by (Li et al., 2019) and shows state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real datasets under quality-only metrics.
 It is only reasonable to combine the two into one system.
 To validate the effectiveness of the proposed attack method, we consider two tasks, namely, face verification and landmark detection, as face recognition field has been extensively explored and the commercially used face models are relatively robust+blonde hairAdversarial ImageSynthesized Image Target ImageMr. BobMr. BobAttribute-conditional Image GeneratorIdentity VerificationOriginal ImageMiss AliceReconstruction via GenerationOriginal AttributeAugmented AttributeAttribute-conditional Image Editing via GenerationFeature-map InterpolationAdversarial ImageOriginal ImageTarget ImageSemanticAdv +pale skinFigure 1: Left: Overview of the proposed SemanticAdv.
 EI improves over both MCMC and VI by tuning the hyper-parameters of a flexible finite-step MCMC chain so that its last state sampling distribution converges fast to a target distribution.
 Our framework marginalizes over all possible factorizations of the joint distribution.
 We have analyzed all the existing GNNs’ filters with this assessment method to answer the three aforementioned questions.
 We evaluate our model on the sinusoidal regression tasks and compare the performance to several meta-learning algorithms.
 Yet, multiple technical issues related to restricted resources, w.r.t. computation and memory, prevent their straightforward application in this particular domain (Han et al., 2016; Samie et al., 2016; Mehta et al., 2018).
Informally, a learner has an incentive to behave in a certain way when doing so can increase its performance (e.g, higher accuracy, or increased reward).
 For instance, DeepFM (Guo et al., 2017) combines FM and deep neural networks (DNN) to do both the second-order and high-order feature interaction.
 It has been widely recognized that performing next-frame prediction typically requires complex feature representations (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Mirza & Osindero, 2014; Lotter et al., 2017; Xue et al., 2016).
 However, such an approach treats the segment-level visual representations as independent inputs and ignores the contextual information derived from other segments in the video.
Our work makes the following contributions:
 Thus, fast approximation methods are desirable in such scenarios.
Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:
 This explains why similar words (e.g, synonyms) have similar embeddings; and embeddings of analogous word pairs share a common “vector offset”.
In this paper, we propose a model state-aware framework for data-efficient deep representation learning, illustrated in Figure 1.
 However, with more driving experience, the better awareness of safety and latent constraints will be slowly formed.
 Training with 8-bit integers has been significantly more challenging because the dynamic range of such formats is not sufficient to represent error gradients during back-propagation.
 The proposed algorithm (14) requires knowing in advance the quality of the surrogate gradient, does not always provide a descent direction that is better than the surrogate gradient, and it remains open how to obtain such surrogate gradients in general settings.
 Our method leverages the fact that a ReLU network is piecewise linear and transitions between linear pieces exactly when one of the ReLUs of the network transitions from its inactive to its active state.
 Imagine an athletic trainer that is demonstrating a tennis swing while also verbally explaining the involved steps, the target position, or the speed.
On the other hand, the structure behind sparsity, imposing constraint on the support of sparse signals, is an important prior knowledge that can be used to enhance the recovery performance (Wang et al., 2014; Prasad et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2012).
 This has been further extended by Kipf et al., (2018), where they addressed the problem by inferring an explicit interaction structure using a variational graph autoencoder.
 Our method builds more balanced decision trees by enforcing the sizes of the data in the left and right child nodes to be equal.
 The goal then is to certify that, for any signal that the attacker can produce, the neural network classifies the signal to the correct label.
Most time-varying data streams change continuously, and so do the predictions of BNNs.
Observation 2.
 Moreover, due to divergence of the structure between the student and teacher networks, the student network usually cannot generate the same intermediate representation as the teacher network.
Consider the following topics (Z1-Z4), where (Z1-Z3) are respectively obtained from different (high-resource) source (S1-S3) domains whereas Z4 from the (low-resource) target domain T in the data-sparsity setting:Z1 (S1): profit, growth, stocks, apple, fall, consumer, buy, billion, shares→ Trading Z2(S2): smartphone, ipad, apple, app, iphone, devices, phone, tablet→ Product Line Z3 (S3): microsoft, mac, linux, ibm, ios, apple, xp, windows→ Operating System/Company Z4 (T ): apple, talk, computers, shares, disease, driver, electronics, profit, ios→ ?Usually, the top words associated with topics learned on a large corpus are semantically coherent and represent meaningful semantics, e.g, Trading, Product Line, etc.
 Even in popular codebases such as the OpenAI Baseline (Dhariwal et al., 2017), L2 regularization and dropout were not incorporated.
 Their major drawback is that they rely on human-designed similarity features and require complex optimization algorithms or solvers, which are mainly CPU based and non-suitable for real time applications.
In this paper, we propose a new efficient and effective model called discriminative variational autoencoder (DiVA) (fig.  1) to address the GR-based CL problem.
More concretely, our LTS method learns both primitive and transitional skills by optimizing an information theoretic objective, where extra transitional skills are generated to fill in the gap between diverse primitive skills.
1In summary, to advance artificial reasoning, the ideal programming problem representation should be:Objective: a candidate solution ought to be unambiguously validated as to whether or not it satisfies the specification.
 The recent success of data-driven image inpainting algorithms (Pathak et al., 2016; Iizuka et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018a;b) demonstrates the capability of deep neural networks to complete large missing regions in natural images in a plausible fashion.
 We conclude that the bias initialization is the key to mimic ReLU geometric behavior in networks with htanh activation.
 Thus, the desired weight pruning needs to preserve the capacity of transfer learning from a sparse pre-trained model to downstream fine-tuning tasks.
 This not only avoids expensive labeling efforts but also allows adaptability and flexibility to the evolving goals of various downstream tasks because “objectness” itself can vary on the situation.
 When datasets are distributed across many∗11, 725km × 2/(3× 108m/s) = 78.16ms.
 For the transformer model, we also consider the effect of updating the hidden states of previous target symbols based on the full source context that is available at any moment.
 Thus, for any fixed generator we expect the weights of the discriminator to diverge as it fully performs the above trick, causing instability and preventing the generator from receiving useful gradient information.
 To understand the learning process of DNNs, one can explore the across-layer behavior by monitoring how the distributions propagate across different layers.
 In the context of dynamics predictions, we propose to use Monte Carlo sampling based dropout on the model weights of a learned forward dynamics predictor to model uncertainty and sample multiple plausible trajectories for an initial state.
 While this works well for attributed graphs with clear cluster structures, real-world networks couldbe highly noisy and sparse.
Although the aforementioned attribution evaluations made success in many cases, setting features with an arbitrary reference values to zero-out the input is limited, in the sense that it only considers the prediction at the reference value while ignoring the rest of the input space.
Our work combines the best of both worlds for 3D shape learning.
 Meanwhile, when examining only the KL divergence between the prior and the posterior distributions in the latent space (instead of the full likelihood), the weak separating capability more consistently prevails between inliers and outliers.
 Several recent approaches have developed strategies that slow down learning on network weights which are important for previously learnt tasks.
 A (haploid) genotype is a bit string.
 4These differences in syntactic position are also of relevance to language modeling, as different positions may pose different restrictions on the words that can appear in them.
 Andoni et al., (2014) showed that for a sufficiently wide two-layer network, gradient descent with respect to the second layer can learn any low degree bounded polynomial.
 These methods enjoy a superior asymptotic performance in convex optimization compared to the standard SGD.
We select an appropriate generative model p(x, z) = p(x | z)p(z) with an approximate posterior q(z |x), where the latents z are going to serve as the transformed representation of x that we wish to compress.
Our rugosity measure quantifies how far the mapping f is from a locally linear mapping on the data.
 The direct way to measure novelty is to count the visited experiences.
 However, an action can have diverse behaviors and hence requires a collection of data (e.g, different viewpoints, videos or state trajectories of how it effects on environment) to sufficiently express this diversity.
 In this instance we may want to guide search towards a candidate possessing a high photoluminescence quantum efficiency with high aleatoric noise.
 This second order statistic suffices to return us the error rates.
 In particular, it learns this representation through reconstruction and prediction of the full-state from the latent state.
 For each encoding scenario, we generate adversarial text against different sentiment classification and QA models.
 We demonstrate that, by placing priors over our likelihood function, we can learn a grounded representation of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty without sampling during inference.
 Abstractly, our method performs in two stages: first, it selects a visited state with the least visitation counts as the goal to reach the boundary of the explored region; then, it takes random actions to explore the non-explored region.
 For imagery data, bluriness usually occurs.
 The general task dependency is learned as a parameterized weighted dependency graph.
 More importantly, we argue that this choice of always adapting from a labeled source is not optimal from an adaptation perspective, because the domain discrepancy between the labeled source and a potential target domain could be high in some cases.
We formalise the process of finding such questions as an adversarial search in a discrete input space arising from perturbations of the original question.
The main contributions of this paper are the following:
The main contribution of this paper include:
 The approach does not require end-task labels and can be applied in an unsupervised setting.
 We show that existing approaches produce representations that cannot be well-modeled by a Gaussian process (GP), or representations that likely do not contain an optimum (Sec.4).
Our contribution The main results are summarized as follows.
Modern automatic ICD coding models (Mullenbach et al., 2018; Rios & Kavuluru, 2018) can accurately assign frequent ICD codes while perform poorly on zero-shot codes.
 This gap-free dataset may be the image itself (9; 20; 18).
2. How robust are the representations that the model has meta-learned to perturbations in the hyperparameters of the update routine?
 This allows one to use much larger learning rates in SGD, typically of the order square root of the minibatch size.
In this paper, we propose a self-ensemble label filtering (SELF) framework that identifies potentially noisy labels during training and keeps the network from receiving supervision from the filtered noisy labels.
 To cope with these issues, some recent QG approaches (Song et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2018b) directly optimize evaluation metrics using Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Williams, 1992).
 Intuitively, achieving good results in MTRL with a single deep neural network is more desirable than using many of them, since the training time is likely much less and the whole architecture is easier to implement.
 The only case we find, where improvements are likely, is where the target token is among the first 2-3 most probable tokens according to the pretrained model.
 Following DIFFPOOL (Ying et al., 2018), we consider graph pooling as a node clustering problem, and each cluster corresponds to a node in the new graph after pooling.
 On the other hand, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) (Kipf & Welling, 2017) brings about new capability on tasks over graph-like data, as it naturally integrates the intrinsic graph structure in a general updating rule:H(l+1) = σ ( ÂH(l)W(l) ) (2)where Â is the normalized connectivity matrix.
 These aforementioned works usually boil down to a general classification task, where the model is learnt on a training set and selected by checking a validation set.
 One of the reasons why adversarial methods outperform greedy methods, such as BC, is that greedy methods only do (1), while adversarial methods do both (1) and (2).
 In its essence, the proposed NODE architecture generalizes CatBoost, making the splitting feature choice and decision tree routing differentiable.
 Specifically, our proposed MMT framework provides robust soft pseudo labels in an on-line peer-teaching manner, which is inspired by the teacher-student approaches (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017; Zhang et al., 2018b) to simultaneously train two same networks.
 However, this does not mean that the learned features are useful as a representation of the new classes.
 The expected action value of estimator one is selected for the maximal action from estimator two, which is guaranteed not to overestimate the true maximum action value.
 Finally, the knowledgelearned from source nodes is highly entangled (Bengio et al., 2013), which can possibly lead to negative transfer (Pan & Yang, 2010).
 We also extend the resource efficient object classification work of Huang et al., (2017) and Bolukbasi et al., (2017) to structured prediction where dynamic computation decisions impact future computation.
 These additional measures brought overheads to the optimization process, making the use of these methods on larger networks difficult.
 While the situation is slightly better in CNN space, all three algorithms still perform similarly to random sampling.
 In order to optimize the DSF, we formulate a diversity loss based on a determinantal point process (DPP) (Macchi, 1975) to evaluate the diversity of the DSF samples.
 It can be interpreted as a penalty function since at the optimal point x? of problem (1), the value r(x?) will be small.
 Treating QA as language modeling is beneficial because the LM can be pre-trained on a large number of sentences without any labeling (Radford et al., 2019); however, this does not directly solve the problem of LLL.
There are several lines of works related to the expensive coordination problem, including mechanism design (Nisan & Ronen, 2001) and the principal-agent model (Laffont & Martimort, 2009).
 Node degree has been used to re-parametrize the non-linear transformation of messages (Monti et al., 2017) or as an additional node feature (Hamilton et al., 2017).
 DBLE learns a distance-based representation space through classification and exploits distances in the space to yield well-calibrated classification.
 In this paper, we concentrate on learning DPPs.
 This inspiration comes from the way of structuring knowledge in knowledge bases (i.g,, knowledge graphs).
 NVIL has several advantages over existing methods, including the ability of black-box learning, tracking the partition function during training and getting approximate samples efficiently during testing.
 In other words, quantization is not only a method to reduce the memory footprint as in traditional work, but also a mandatory step to make the network deployable on integer hardware.
 One important application of this task is semantic segmentation of breast cancer metastases in histological lymph node sections, which is a crucial step in staging of breast cancer (Brierley et al., 2016).
 Yet, conventional continual learning methods have not been verified for their scalability to a large number of tasks, both in terms of effectiveness in the prevention ofcatastrophic forgetting, and efficiency as to memory usage and computations (See Figure 1 (a), and (b)).
 Asmore complex and heterogeneous tasks are considered, one would like a more flexible, data-driven approach to determine the appropriate amount of sharing across tasks.
 The true target blackbox model is not shown, but we only assume limited query access and that it has beentrained on ImageNet-1k (Deng et al., 2009).
 Our research interest is in fusing the strengths of these two worlds.
 Determining a QBN for each weight kernel via hand-crafted heuristics is so sophisticated that even machine learning experts can obtain only sub-optimal results.
 Inspired by this result, we examine the connection topologies of the architectures generated by popular NAS algorithms.
To solve the unknown representation problem of the state, Hausknecht & Stone (2015) and Zhu et al., (2018) try to represent the state as latent variables of neural networks.
 The rank of actions depends on the relative action values.
Despite these fundamental challenges, several recent works have demonstrated promising empirical results in representation learning using MI maximization (van den Oord et al., 2018; Hénaff et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2019; Hjelm et al., 2019; Bachman et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019).
 In order to isolate these factors, we study one broad factor affecting generalization that is most correlated with themes in SL, specifically observational overfitting, where an agent overfits due to properties of the observation which are irrelevant to the latent dynamics of the MDP family.
 With increasing number of pixel deflections (Prakash et al., 2018), there is improvement onthe performance on adversarial images, but this comes with a rapid deterioration of performance on clean images.
 Note that slipshod clipping of outliers can jeopardize the network a lot (Zhao et al., 2019) although they may only take 1-2% of all weights in one layer.
 And the performance of MC-CFR depends on the structure of the game and the chosen online learning algorithm.
 Let A and B denote two DNNs learned for the same task. xA and xB denote two intermediate-layer features of A and B, respec-∗Ruofan Liang and Tianlin Li contribute equally to this research.
In contrast, our approach explicitly handles view-dependent effects to output photo-realistic images and videos.
 However, most of the defense mechanisms are heuristic or ad-hoc, which lack principled theoretical justification (Carlini and Wagner, 2016; He et al., 2017).
 The entailed and refuted statements are both annotated by human workers.
Our goal is to advance a step further towards UTM by coupling a MANN with an external program memory.
 Consider, for example, the task of opening a drawer and putting a book in it, given supervision only in the form of the final image of the open drawer containing the book.
 We expect an increasing trend of NMARL based controllers in the near future, after the development of advanced communication technologies such as 5G and Internet-of-Things.
In this paper, we introduce a set pooling method for neural networks that addresses both the encoding bottleneck issue and the decoding failure issue.
 Moreover, we analyze the pre-trainedLMs and constituency trees from various points of view, including looking into which layer(s) of the LMs is considered to be sensitive to phrase information (§6).
 Graph reasoning needs to learn about entities, relations, and their composing rules to manipulate structured knowledge and produce structured explanations.
 For examples, the adversarial training (AT) methods (Madry et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Shafahi et al., 2019) induce locally stable behavior via data augmentation on adversarial examples.
 It is still unclear about their performance on real datasets.
Schmidt et al., (2018) show that the sample complexity of robust learning can be significantly larger than that of standard learning.
 In their proof of low-rank recovery for such models, Li et al., (2017) show that the model remains lowrank throughout the optimization process, leading to the successful generalization.
 This problem statement is more narrow than the standard information bottleneck, but encompasses many practical use cases.
 Now on the one hand, such disruptions – or side-effects – might be difficult to recover from.
 Such predictions could even become harmful if the predictions entailed decisions with severe consequences (Leslie (2019)).
 Figure 2 illustrates selection bias in an example (synthetic) observational dataset.
We evaluate our method, in both settings, in three different platforms to demonstrate its applicability in a wide range of domains.
Distribution Transformation The generator of GAN model and the decoder of VAE model are trained to compute a transport map that transforms a known continuous distribution (e.g, Gaussian white noise) to the real data distribution.
 In our situation, an appropriate algebra is the Clifford algebra Cl(H) of the space H of queries and keys, which contains that space H ⊆ Cl(H) and in which queries and keys can be multiplied.
 In contrast to previous meta-imitation learning approaches that learn one-shot imitation learning procedures through imitation (Duan et al., 2017; Finn et al., 2017b), our approach enables the agent to improve at the test task through trial-and-error.
 Such process is designed for increasing the robustness and accuracy of the tracking results, but ironically, we find that it can be exploited by attackers to substantially alter the tracking results.
 Another approach selects or reweights samples so that noisy samples contribute less to the loss (Jiang et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2018).
Compared with natural training (on natural examples), training adversarially robust DNNs is particularly difficult (Madry et al., 2018).
 Although network structures vary depending on the input types, it is desired that the piecewise linearity of features to be preserved, so that the resulting accuracy does not degrade too much compared with the original features.
 This is in contrast to the deterministic Nesterov method, which accelerates using the same step size as optimal gradient descent.
Concretely, in this paper we answer the following simple question: “is self-supervision able to exploit the information contained in a large number of images in order to learn different parts of a neural network?”We contribute two key findings.
 Even though this setting is not universally applicable (e.g, when the observations are not human interpretable) and a completely unsupervised approach would be elegant, collecting a small number of human annotations is simple and cheap via crowd-sourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, and is common practice in the development of real-world machine learning systems.
 1.Permutation of units (neurons) within a layer, i.g,for some permutation matrix P, Wl ← PWl, bl ← Pbl, (1)Wl+1 ←Wl+1P−1.
 Recent works, however, have shown that likelihoods derived from generative models fail to distinguish between training data and some OOD input types (Choi et al., 2018; Nalisnick et al., 2019a; Hendrycks et al., 2019).
 We procedurally generate environment dynamics and natural language templated descriptions of dynamics and goals to produced a combinatorially large number of environment dynamics to train and evaluate RTFM.
 After all, the knowledge of what cannot be computed (and thus learned) by a network of specific characteristics applies independently of the training procedure.
 2In our work, the domain is defined by datasets.
 Ideally, curricula would apply to complex, varying environments and would support goal-conditioning to handle changing tasks.
 The top and bottom figures are respectively the visualization of PETS (Chua et al., 2018) and our algorithm.
 We formalize the intuition in Section 4 by defining the so-called conservatively-extrapolated value function, which is guaranteed to induce a policy that stays close to the demonstrations states (Theorem 4.4).
 However, for general approximators and MDPs it can diverge as demonstrated by Tsitsiklis & Van Roy (1997).
 Not surprisingly, when meta-learning is applied directly on lexical inputs, its performance drops below a simple nearest neighbor classifier.
 We identify some mild conditions that guarantees SGD with stochastic momentum will provably escape saddle points faster than the standard SGD, which provides clear evidence for the benefit of using stochastic momentum.
 We train each adversarial policy using model-free RL against a fixed black-box victim.
 However, GSTs are associated with exponential complexity in space and time that increases with the number of layers.
 Our experiments on 10 common Wikidata (Vrandečić & Krötzsch, 2014) relations reveal that existing pretrained models encode entity-level knowledge only to a limited degree.
 Figure 1 illustrates the Huberised and partially Huberised logistic loss.
 However, this is computationally expensive as it requires to perform the training from scratch.
 Additionally, since programs are highly structured objects, static program syntax can supplement dynamic information with additional context about the program’s execution.
As the well-said quote goes: “those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it”.
 Specifically, GAN consists of two functions: generator and discriminator.
 Based on a surrogated loss of AUC and inspired by the min-max reformulation in (Ying et al., 2016), we cast the problem into a non-convex concave minmax stochastic optimization problem, where it is nonconvex in the primal variable and concave in the dual variable.
 Using linear or convex relaxations of fully connected ReLU networks, a robust certification method computes a “safe radius” r for a classifier at a given input such that at any point within the neighboring radius-r ball of the input, the classifier is guaranteed to have unchanged predictions.
an input from the capsule corresponding to the correct class results in a much lower reconstruction error than reconstructing the input from capsules corresponding to incorrect classes, as shown in Figure 1(a).
 The idea is to partition the input space into subspaces based on the classification system’s output and perform adversarial/natural sample classification in these subspaces.
The third category considers learning a model of the environment and estimating a belief state, extracted from a sequence of state-transitions (Kaelbling et al., 1998; Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018; Lee et al., 2019).
 In the proposed scheme, the shared best policy information is used only to guide other learners’ policies for searching a better policy.
In a different body of language research literature, evolutionary linguists have already studied the origins of compositionality for decades (Kirby & Hurford, 2002; Kirby et al., 2014; 2015).
 NAttack also used a regression network as initialization in the score-based attack (Li et al., 2019a).
 This leaves the door open for adapting classifiers to the test images, deliberately or unintentionally, via extensive hyperparameter tuning, raising the risk of overfitting.
 We observe that a finetuning solution of mixout(wpre) deviates less from wpre in the L2-sense than∗Department of Mathematical Sciences, KAIST, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea †New York University ‡Facebook AI Research §CIFAR Azrieli Global Scholarthat of dropout.

Dictionary learning for classification was introduced in Mairal et al., (2009) and implemented with deep convolutional neural network architectures by several authors (Sulam et al., 2018; Mahdizadehaghdam et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2018).
 To address these goals, we propose an efficient framework with provable guarantees for neural pruning, which is based on the existing theory of coresets such as (Braverman et al., 2016).
 The descent path property is shown to be satisfied in over-parameterized shallow networks with sufficiently large widths (Venturi et al., 2018).
 Compared to conventional baselines, SVD-RND shows a significant performance gain from 50% to over 90% in these domains.
This result only relies on four mild assumptions that cover most practical circumstances: (1) the training sample set is linearly inseparable; (2) all training sample points are distinct; (3) the output layer is narrower than the other hidden layers; and (4) there exists some turning point in the piecewise linear activations that the sum of the slops on the two sides does not equal to 0.
We briefly review some existing policies and discuss their limitations: In the simple bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) policy Valiant (1990), the parameter server waits for all workers to push their updated gradients, and then lets them pull the same latest model parameters for the next step.
 Sunehag et al., (2018) designed a value-decomposition network (VDN) to learn an optimal linear value decomposition from the team reward signal based on the assumption that the joint actionvalue function for the system can be additively decomposed into value functions across agents.
 Since this idea comes from an artifact of SGD optimization, it can be applied to any architecture optimized with SGD.
 In contrast to VAEs relying on variational approximations, flow-based models allow for latent-variable inference and likelihood evaluation in an exact and efficient manner, making themselves a perfect choice for achieving identifiability.
 For instance, Cao & Gong (2017) is the first to propose randomized smoothing with uniform noise as an empirical defense.
 A popular variant is based on pseudocounts (Bellemare et al., 2016), which derive an intrinsic bonus from approximate visitation counts over states and is inspired by the tabular MBIE-EB algorithm (Strehl and Littman, 2008).

 For instance, in active learning, additional training data should be collected from regions with high knowledge uncertainty, but not data uncertainty.
 This makes ASGD a potentially better alternative to SSGD when using cloud computing.
 A classic example is shown in Figure 1.
Motivated by these observations, we establish criteria which a function approximating the error landscape should meet.
 Some have used heuristic search to infer structured queries from denotations (Pasupat & Liang, 2016; Dasigi et al., 2019): this works in some cases but often an answer could be associated with many possible structured queries, introducing noise.
 However, loop invariants must be represented as explicit SMT formulas to be usable for program verification.
As a step towards understanding which methods are more effective, we have collected code for 8 reasonably fast (search time of less than 4 days) NAS algorithms, and benchmarked them on 5 well known CV datasets.
 Firstly, in dense prediction tasks such as video prediction, models are required to make pixel-wise predictions, which emphasizes the demand for the preservation of information through layers.
 While metric learning is about whether an object is ‘similar to or dissimilar from’ another object, order learning is about ‘greater than or smaller than.’ Section 2 reviews this related work.
 To answer the question∗Equal contribution.
 We show this behaviour of the VAE can lead to extreme errors in the recovered representation by the encoder and is a key hurdle in the effective use of representations for data-efficient learning and transfer.
 Most importantly, the VAE objective itself poses several challenges as it admits trivial solutions that decouple the latent space from the input (Chen et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017), leading to the posterior collapse phenomenon in conjunction with powerful decoders (van den Oord et al., 2017).
 Here we conduct an experiment to study the differences between the ERF of several FPN features.
 Our goal is to extrapolate from the training scenes to novel states that induce a specified behavior in the agent.
∗Equal contribution.
 Since a convolutional layer has an alternative representation as a fully connected layer, these analyses apply in the case of convolutional networks, but, intuitively, the weight-tying employed in the convolutional layer constrains the set of functions computed by the layer.
 In this paper, we provide a simple way to fix this problem.
 Similar to variational continual learning (VCL) (Nguyen et al., 2018) and the Virtual Vector Machine (VVM) (Minka et al., 2009), we approximate the posterior using a Gaussian distribution and a complementary memory of previous data.
 We assign a probability measure to each graph, which we refer to as a graph spectral measure (similar to (Gu et al., 2015)), based on the spectrum of the graph’s normalized Laplacian matrix representation.
 Recall that in supervised learning, the distribution of the training data is decoupled from the learned model, whereas in imitation learning, the agent’s policy affects what state is queried next.
 In our attack, the attacker only knows the pretrained (teacher) model used to re-train the target (student) model.
 The decoder is decomposed into conditionally independent components including a language model, a context processor, and a knowledge processor, and the three components are coordinated by a decoding manager that dynamically determines which component is activated for response prediction.
 The accumulation process is three-staged.
These results give, for any depth and a fairly general non-linearity, a complete description of the spectrum of the Hessian in terms of the NTK at initialization and throughout training.
 Also, as the aggregated effect of the population abstracts away the strategic interactions between individual agents, it circumvents the computational intractability of the MARL approaches that do not exploit symmetry.
 A number of verification frameworks were proposed over the last few years that can be roughly divided into complete (Katz et al., 2017; 2019; Tjeng et al., 2019) and incomplete methods (Weng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2018).
 The critic is learned adversarially by maximizing the MMD at the same time as it is minimized with respect to the generator.

In this paper, we conduct both empirical and theoretical analysis of the convergence issue to identify its origin.
The most direct use of DDL is to provide reward shaping for a standard deep RL algorithm, to optimize a policy to reach a given goal state.
 Intuitively, if support data is expected to be scarce, the meta-learner needs to provide strong inductive bias to the task-specific learner as the danger of overfitting is high.
 2 GLIDER identifies interactions that consistently appear over multiple data samples, then explicitly encodes these interactions in a target black-box recommender model frec.
 Meanwhile, work in computational neuroscience tells us that visual features (see, e.g, Hubel & Wiesel, 1968) can be inferred from the statistics of static images using unsupervised learning (Olshausen & Field, 1996).
 By explicitly controlling the temperature we remove a potential source of bias (models may have different ”implicit” temperatures) and obtain a more complete understanding of each model’s behavior (Figure 1 middle and right).
 Auxiliary network structures and training objectives in Zhu et al., (2017b) unavoidably increase training difficulty and memory footprint.
 Learning the quantization mapping by seeking to minimize task loss is appealing to us as it directly seeks to improve on the metric of interest.
 Once the dog face fills the full frame, continuing to walk in this direction fails to increase the zoom.
 Active learning (AL) is a well-established field that studies precisely this: selecting the most informative samples to label so that a learning algorithm will perform better with less data than a non-selective approach, such as labelling the entire collection of data.
 Figure 1 reproducing Ilyas et al., (2019) illustrates this observation for the MNIST dataset–see Appendix A for other datasets.
 A few works (Wang et al., 2005; Liu & Zheng, 2006; Görnitz et al., 2013) have investigated the general semi-supervised AD setting where one also utilizes labeled anomalies, however existing deep approaches are domain or data-type specific (Ergen et al., 2017; Kiran et al., 2018; Min et al., 2018).
 More specifically, we focus on limiting the number of iterations.
 This approach has also been motivated from a biological viewpoint (Li et al., 2018) by relating to a fruit fly’s olfactory circuit, thus suggesting the possibility of hashing using higher dimensions instead of reducing the dimensionality.
the performance of batch TD algorithms, and Peng et al., (2019) proposed two variants of SVRG to further save the computation cost.
 This means that every iteration – every update to the behavior policy – requires new interactions with the environment, precluding the use of these algorithms in settings where interactions with the environment are expensive and limited.
 It can be derived from the results of Srebro et al., (2010).
(ii) it is not focused on optimizing sequence generation, only on producing the next token.
By augmenting state-of-the art neural TTS with semi-supervised deep generative models within the VAE framework (Kingma et al., 2014; Narayanaswamy et al., 2017), we show that it is possible to not only discover latent attributes of speech but to do so in a reliable and controllable manner.
 Local ensembles also address a gap in approximate methods for estimating prediction uncertainty.
 Users may then perform model fine-tuning or transfer learning with a small set of bonafide data that they have.
 A wealth of work has shown in the single-task setting that it is possible for an adversary with only access to the model to learn detailed information about the training set, such as the presence or absence of specific records (Shokri et al., 2017) or the identities of sensitive features given other covariates (Fredrikson et al., 2015).
More specifically, current benchmarks: 1) Consider homogeneous learning tasks.
 Thus, one typically first uses a less powerful but more efficient algorithm (another scoring function f ) to reduce the solution space (the “retrieval phase”), and then use the BERT-style model to re-rank the retrieved documents (the “scoring phase”).
 Designing reward functions that cause MBRL to evoke complex, desirable behavior is difficult when the space of possible undesirable behaviors is large.
 Currently, this is achieved by simulating the whole range of noise levels during training (Zhang et al., 2017).
new formulation enjoys the benefit of having a smooth boundary in most tasks and the function value is computable using hard-label queries.
 Moreover, we found that current solutions that rely on greedy sampling lead to significant fractions of the candidate configurations being redundant over iterations, and that any optimizingcompiler are prone to invalid configurations which significantly prolongs the optimization time.
 One possibility is that contextual illusions like the orientation-tilt illusion are “bugs”: vestiges of evolution or biological constraints on the neural hardware.
Finally, in order to provide a cleaner framework for understanding the relationship between the above principles and generalization, we re-introduce Zero-Shot Learning from scratch (ZFS).
 Is there a way to further close the performance gap with standard AT models?In this paper, we aim to answer the three questions above, improving understanding of knowledge distillation through empirical analysis over a variety of AT and NAT models.
 A schematic comparison between the centralized and distributed backdoor attacks is illustrated in fig. 1.
In this work, we combine the ideas of BNNs and QNNs in a novel way that addresses the aforementioned challenges (1)(2)(3)(4) in training both models.
 In summary, our contributions are:
 However, the high variance of ZO gradient estimator which results from both random query directions and random samples (in stochastic setting) hampers the convergence rate of current ZO algorithms.
 Unlike Gym or Atari, 3D simulators require GPU acceleration, and, consequently, the number of workers is greatly limited (25 to 8 vs. 212 to 15).
 We are interested in producing confidence sets that satisfy statistical guarantees while being as small as possible.
In this paper, we reduce the inefficiency of a statically quantized DNN via precision gating (PG), which computes most features with low-precision arithmetic operations and only updates few important features to a high precision.
 Our contributions are two-fold:
 Our fast-weights approach stands in contrast to existing methods which encode objects as vector-valued inputs to a decoder network with fixed weights.
 To begin with, as shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), we construct VHE-StackGAN++ by using the Poisson gamma belief network (PGBN) (Zhou et al., 2016) as the VHE text decoder, using the Weibull upward-downward variational encoder (Zhang et al., 2018a) as the VHE image encoder, and feeding the concatenation of the multi-stochastic-layer latent representation of the VHE as the source of randomness into the image generator of StackGAN++ (Zhang et al., 2017b).

 In order to solve solve a popular IF game such as Zork1 it’s necessary to generate actions consisting of up to five-words from a relatively modest vocabulary of 697 words recognized by Zork’s parser.
In this paper, we take the second approach and particularly focus on the important question of what desirable traits should the latent embedding exhibit for it to be amenable to a specific class of control/learning algorithms, namely the widely used class of locally-linear control (LLC) algorithms? We argue from an optimal control standpoint that our latent space should exhibit three properties.

 We propose that this commonality detection can be explained as follows:
Neural networks augmented with external memory, like the Differential Neural Computer (Graves et al., 2016, DNC), and end to end memory networks (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015, EMN) have shown remarkable abilities to tackle difficult computational and reasoning tasks.
Similar problems can be seen in the field of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) research where a long piece of text is translated from one language to another.
 We will address this issue later but we note that this is not an artifact of CTRNN but is exhibited by ODEs that have motivated other RNNs (see Sec.2).

It has been hypothesized that in the mammalian brain sleep helps to create generalized representations of an input learned during the awake state (Stickgold & Walker (2013); Lewis & Durrant (2011)).
 In particular, Hardt & Ma (2016) established the existence of small norm solutions for deep residual networks with sufficiently large depth L, and proved that there are no critical points other than the global minimum when the maximum spectral norm among all weight matrices is smaller than Op1{Lq.
 Along similar lines, brain parcellations are a well studied paradigm for capturing the structure of brain activity (Thirion et al., 2014), often via statistical parcellation based on ward clustering (Ward Jr, 1963).

 At every frame, the architecture estimates and accounts for the motion of the camera, so that the internal 3D representation remains stable under egomotion.
 For learning rep-resentations, the model is exposed to the training instances and trained through different sampling strategies or losses.
 As an example, consider a robotic arm that executes a control policy to perform a specific task in a factory.
 These networks represent each parameter with a distribution defined by a mean and variance over possible values drawn from a shared latent probability distribution (Blundell et al., 2015).
 They show that there is a monotonic relationship between the (empirical) risk and the (empirical) adversarial risk when the 0-1 loss function is used.
 By combining ideas from deep generative models, FL, and user-level differential privacy (DP), we show how some needs traditionally met with data inspection can instead be met by generating synthetic examples from a privacy-preserving federated generative model.
 Computation-wise, each ensemble member requires a separate neural network forward pass of its inputs.
 Consequently, each layer has assigned two objectives: Learning the inverse of the layer’s forward function and minimizing the difference to the back-projected target activity.
 It is unsuitable to directly use continuous differential operators to provide local behaviors because it is hard to approximate the continuous derivatives precisely with the sparse points (Shewchuk, 2002; Amenta & Kil, 2004; Luo et al., 2009).
 The reward to guide RL can be: 1) a task-dependent user-defined metric, such as CIDEr for image captioning (Vedantam et al., 2015) and Generalization for neural program synthesis (Bunel et al., 2018); and 2) automatically learned reward using a discriminator or language model (Yang et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2017; Lamb et al., 2016; Caccia et al., 2018; d’Autume et al., 2019).
 In optimization, smoothness is a well-known condition that ensures that gradient descent and its variants become stable (see e.g, Bertsekas (1999)).
 c Fine-tuning: re-training the entire duplicated source model (Dauphin et al., 2012).
 In practice, however, such data are often collected over an extended period of time by multiple, unknown behavior policies.
 Our normalization has the effect of preventing the output features of distant nodes to be too similar or indistinguishable, while at the same time allowing those of connected nodes in the same cluster become more similar.
 Denote by θ the network parameters and by θp0q its random initialization.
 For example, to describe a scene, one likely enumerates the objects seen, their relative positions and relations and their characteristics (Berg et al., 2012).

In this paper, we study the optimization and generalization of over-parametrized two-layer neural networks via relating to their higher-order approximations, a principled generalization of the NTK.
 However, since RCFR uses full traversals of the game tree, it is still impractical for large games.
 To resolve this ambiguity, we first generate a set of candidate outputs for x∗, then use a neural model (which we train beforehand) that acts as an oracle and selectsthe most likely output, and finally, add x∗ and its predicted output to the input specification I.
 The proposed method iteratively improves the generalized ability of random forests for higher strength and lowers correlation by probabilistic triplet sampling.

To enhance the saliency of Jacobians, we draw inspirations from neural generative networks (Choi et al., 2018; Dai & Wipf, 2019).
The simplest baseline we can think of is to pre-train a model on the meta-training dataset using the standard cross-entropy loss, and then fine-tune on the few-shot dataset.
In this work, we develop a general framework for black-box verification that recovers prior work as special cases, and improves upon previous results in various ways.
 This is similar to the situation in image generation where an L2 objective produces blurry results, due to independence assumptions between output dimensions.
In short, the existing neural symbolic superoptimization algorithms all require human input to define equivalences.
 The augmentation policy is dynamically changed along with the training state of the target network, rather than fixed throughout the whole training process like normal AutoAugment (Cubuk et al., 2019).
 While learning to solve diverse tasks, it accumulates the meta-knowledge that is not specific to a single task, but is generic across all tasks, which is later leveraged when learning for a novel task.
 Examples of these notions include demographic parity, equalized odds, and equalized opportunity.
 For example, if the expert believes that one data Y is essentially data X with added Gaussian noise, then Euclidean cost could be natural.

 The critical limitation of prior expansion methods, however, is that the decisions of when to expand and which resource to use heavily rely on explicitly given task definition and heuristics.
 Structural representations would find applications in node classification, graph classification, and role discovery.
 Our contribution is two-fold:
 However, in standard neural networks with zero imputation, we observe that the model’s inference correlates with the number of known entries of the data instance as shown inthe second row of Figure 11.
 We call this phenomenon as over-smoothing of node features.
 Our model guides the translation to focus on more important regions and ignore minor regions by distinguishing between source and target domains based on the attention map obtained by the auxiliary classifier.
 The hypothesis is that when training conditionally gated networks, we can train models with a better accuracy/computation cost trade-off than their fully feed-forward counterparts.
 The resulting representations are more robust for the given task as they have eliminated view specific nuisances.
 Here we take a probabilistic approach: rather than learning a subsampling scheme directly, we pose a probability distribution that expresses belief over effective subsampling patterns and optimize the distribution’s parameters instead.
 Intuitively, compared with the model trained on contaminated dataset, the one trained on clean data could be better at distinguishing outliers from normal data.
 Crucially, we aim to learn an optimizer that generalizes to a broad set of previously unseen computation graphs, without the need for training on such graphs, thus allowing it to be fast at test time.
Ensembles have been widely explored as an approach to improve the performance of machine learning models and classifiers (Hansen & Salamon (1990)).
 In recent work Montobbio et al., (2019) show that such advanced V1 modeling geometries emerge in specific CNN architectures and in Ecker et al., (2019) the relation between group structure and the organization of V1 is explicitly employed to effectively recover actual V1 neuronal activities from stimuli by means of G-CNNs.
 As illustrated in Figure 1, an advantage of our layer dropping technique, or LayerDrop, is that from one single deep model, we can extract shallow sub-networks of any desired depth on demand at inference time.
One hypothesis that has been discussed as a way to explain the success of M-BERT has to do with some level of language similarity.

 However, such information may not always be accessible to the users, analysts, and adversaries.
 Indeed, Pérez et al., (2019) showed that a multilayer attention-based architecture with additive positional encodings is Turing complete under some strong theoretical assumptions, such as unbounded precision arithmetic.
 Besides, there is no theoretic comparison between policy-aware and policy-agnostic methods.
 The environment distributions in these cases have still been relatively low-diversity, mostly limited to variations of the same task, such as exploring different mazes or navigating terrains of different slopes.
3 Highly variable initial conditions (i.g, changes in the starting configuration of the environment in each episode) are a big challenge for learning from demonstrations, because the demonstrations can not account for all possible configurations.
 Explicit transduction is less explored in meta-learning, the exception is Liu et al., (2018), who adapted the idea of label propagation (Zhu et al., 2003) from graph-based semi-supervised learning methods.
 In fact, often higher likelihood is assigned to OOD data than to the training data itself (Nalisnick et al., 2019a).
 A successful unsupervised disentanglement algorithm will be able to learn a representation in which different factors of variation such as class and content will be represented separately.
Our approach, the Mixed-curvature Variational Autoencoder, is a generalization of VAEs to products of constant curvature spaces.
 This is similar to other model-based RL methods, but simpler, since in the context of sequence optimization, the state-transition model is deterministic and known.
 Although various techniques are employed to increase the query efficiency for the gradient estimation, they need an excessively large query budget to achieve a successful attack (Alzantot et al., 2018).
 These can then be further decomposed into smaller substask until some base subtask (e.g, pickup egg) is reached.
 To this end, we devise two metrics.
 In particular, it is essential to devise data structures and computational paradigms that can accommodate global fast convolutions, and at the same time track the non-linear feature evolution.
In this paper, we introduce a new type of contextual representation, StructBERT, which incorporates language structures into BERT pre-training by proposing two novel linearization strategies.
 Secondly, we further propose to use the real-valued activations of the binary network, available prior to the binarization preceding convolution, to compute scale factors that are used to re-scale the activations right after the application of the binary convolution.
 The observation lets us refine our question: When do the phase transitions occur, and how do they depend on the structure of the dataset? These questions are important, since answering them will help us gain a better understanding of the IB objective and its close interplay with the dataset and the learned representation.
 Howard et al., (2019); Cai et al., (2019); Wu et al., (2019); Stamoulis et al., (2019a) search the expansion ratios in the MobileNetV2 block but still limit them to a few discrete values.
 Several recent works have also suggested that by controlling the amount of information between learned representations and the original data, one can tune desired characteristics of trained models such as generalization error (Tishby & Zaslavsky, 2015; Vera et al., 2018), robustness (Alemi et al., 2017), and detection of out-of-distribution data (Alemi et al., 2018a).
 We discovered that the prevailing bottleneck-structured transformer block is not efficient.
Our discussion above directly follows that of Savarese et al., (2019), who initiated the study of the representational cost in term of weight magnitude.
 It provides means to generate a pair for each input point, for which the Lipschitz constraint is likely to be violated with high probability.
 It also helps humans acquire language from a small amount of data, and expand vocabulary sequentially (Biemiller, 2001).
 Due to the dynamics mismatch, the imitator becomes more likely to deviate from the demonstrations compared with the traditional imitation learning setting.
On the contrary, classical shape segmentation methods, such as (Kaick et al., 2014) that use manually designed features with relatively local context, can often perform much better on unseen object categories, although they tend to give inferior segmentation results on training categories (Table 1).
 More recently, Hosseini & Poovendran (2018) manipulated hue and saturation of an image to create adversarial perturbations.
 One may anticipate simultaneous regularization and normalization could improve sample quality.
 Sequentially processing every object in an image, SQAIR has a fundamental limitation in scaling up to scenes with a large number of objects.
 For instance, rounding decimals (Tramèr et al., 2016), revealing only high-confidence predictions (Orekondy et al., 2019), and introducing ambiguity at the tail end of the posterior distribution (Lee et al., 2018).
To turn this intuition into a working algorithm, we develop a multibranch architecture that sends the data through multiple network branches in parallel.
In this work, we close this research gap by proposing a probabilistic deep learning model inspired by Directional Statistics (Mardia & Jupp, 1999).
Although incorporating equivariance to arbitrary transformation groups is conceptually and theoretically similar1, evidence from real-world experiences motivating their integration might strongly differ.
 This is a promising approach as DNNs with learned quantization parameters almost always outperform DNNs with handcrafted ones.
 Instead of sampling labels uniformly, our algorithm uses an adversarial auxiliary model to draw ‘fake’ labels that are more realistic by taking the input features of the data into account.
Specifically, after providing some background (Section 2), we make the following contributions:
 However, doing so requires requires either a limit to be taken or a generalization of variational inference to a quasi-KL divergence (Hron et al., 2018).
Understanding the generalization performance in machine learning has been a central problem for many years and revived in recent years with the advent of deep learning.
 Moreover, stealing leads to threats such as Camouflage attacks (Xiao et al., 2019) that trigger misclassifications by exploiting the image scaling algorithms that are common in DNN pre-processing pipelines.
 The large latency translates to higher energy consumption during inference, thereby, diminishing the efficiency improvements of SNNs over ANNs.
In summary, we consider methods that attack a certified classifier in the following sense:
 RNN-based models have been outperformed by the recent state-of-the-art Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017), which features multiple encoder-decoder attention layers and multihead attention at each layer.
 Therefore, our model provides a local approximation of fine-tuning an underlying deep model, and the accuracy of the approximation is controlled by the semantic gap between the representation-learning and the target tasks.
∗Equal contribution, corresponding authors.
 Kailun Wu did his work when he was a Ph.D. student at Tsinghua Unversity, and now he works at Alibaba Group.
 Our theory gives new theoretical conditions under which neither layer stacking nor non-linearity contributes to improving expressive power.
 One option is to use semi-supervised methods which combine a small handful of labels with a larger, unlabeled, dataset.
 Thanks to its simplicity, the model permits closed-form sampling and moment computation.
In this paper, we identify one such weakness about the skip connections used by many state-of-theart DNNs.
 In detail, we transform the existing sentence-image pairs into a topic-image lookup table from a small-scale multimodal data set Multi30K.

Our focus in this paper is on selective synaptic plasticity.
 Accuracy parity and the so-called predictive rate parity (c.f. Definition 2.4) could be simultaneously achieved, e.g, the COMPAS tool (Dieterich et al., 2016).
 Many different theoretical frameworks exist, and the details of such frameworks are contained in Appendix 9.1.
 More precisely, if two nodes are labeled the same by the algorithm underlying the WL test, then the feature vectors of these nodes produced by any AC-GNN will always be the same.
 1We define it as K = 1N ∑N i=1(gi − g)T (gi − g), where gi = g(xi, yi; θ) is the gradient of the training loss L with respect to θ on xi, N is the number of training examples, and g is the full-batch gradient.
What are the neural circuits that implement Gestalt vs. object-based routines for perceptual grouping? Visual neuroscience studies have suggested that these routines emerge from specific types of neural interactions: (i) horizontal connections between neurons within an area, spanning spatial locations and potentially feature selectivity (Stettler et al., 2002; Gilbert & Wiesel, 1989; McManus et al., 2011; Bosking et al., 1997; Schmidt et al., 1997; Wannig et al., 2011), and (ii) descending top-down connections from neurons in higher-to-lower areas (Ko & von der Heydt, 2018; Gilbert & Li, 2013; Tang et al., 2018; Lamme et al., 1998; Murray et al., 2004; 2002).
 Similarly, in the case of different channels of a hidden layer of the network, there is a strong correlation or "cross-talk" between these channels; we refer to this as channel-wise correlation.
Recent work on unsupervised text style transfer mostly employs non-generative or non-probabilistic modeling approaches.
 Igor provided research supervision and team leadership.
In response to this problem, NAS-Bench-101 (Ying et al., 2019) and NAS-HPO-Bench (Klein & Hutter, 2019) are proposed.
 Otherwise, the transfer of knowledge from related pre-training tasks to a new downstream task can harm generalization, which is known as negative transfer (Rosenstein et al., 2005) and significantly limits the applicability and reliability of pre-trained models.
 Second, the sequential latent model can better leverage the response information, which makes knowledge selection even more accurate.
 Indeed, in many practical applications, optimizations are repeated numerous times in similar settings, underlining the need for specialized optimizers.
 A state of an n-qubit quantum register corresponds to a vector in C2n .
 Thus, humans provide paired supervision of rules and exemplars demonstrating correct deployment of that rule.
 We propose to let message embeddings interact based on the distance between atoms and the angle between directions.
 However, these bounds are typically exponentially dependent on the number of layers and thus tends to be loose for deep network situations (Dziugaite & Roy, 2017; Arora et al., 2018; Nagarajan & Kolter, 2019).
 This phenomena is called gradient staleness or delay as we will refer to it, and it causes a deterioration in generalization performance when using A-SGD.
 Very similar results exist for other members of the exponential family with two parameters, such as the beta and gamma distributions.
 (iii) The parameterization should admit practically efficient algorithms for training and inference, in terms of both speed and memory.
 Despite their insightful findings, there remains to be a major gap between the winning ticket observation and the goal of more efficient training, since winning tickets were only identified by pruning unimportant connections after fully training a dense network.
 In practice, we find highly suboptimal local minima in realistic neural loss functions, and we discuss reasons why suboptimal local minima exist in the loss surfaces of deep neural networks in general.
 Many of these methods are trained to maximize a particular lower bound called InfoNCE (van den Oord et al., 2019)—also known as contrastive learning (Arora et al., 2019).
 Therefore, after such aggregation, we cannot know which node contributes what to the final aggregated output.
Motivated by the importance of these off-line scenarios, and by the inapplicability of classical methods, we study the problem of off-line estimation of stationary values via a stationary distribution corrector.
 When this happens during training, such a non-responding/inactive device, which is called a straggler, appears tremendously slower than the other devices.
 By directly working with a general framework, our identified algorithmic improvements can be combined with any bounding method, leading to potential performance improvement for BaB based verification algorithms.
In a more encompassing view, our model can be seen as enriching the mostly additive dynamics of recurrent transitions placing it in the company of the Input Switched Affine Network (Foerster et al.,2017) with a separate transition matrix for each possible input, and the Multiplicative RNN (Sutskever et al., 2011), which factorizes the three-way tensor of stacked transition matrices.
In this work, we explore the low-rank structures.
 We conclude (in Section 3) by discussing several areas where such understanding is most critically needed.
This observations prompt us to study how such code-level optimizations change agent training dynamics, and whether we can truly think of them as merely auxiliary improvements.
 Tasks with higher shots could benefit from taking gradient steps afar, while tasks with few shots may need to stay close to the initial parameter.
 These approaches are faced with a common problem that the search space of all valid secondary structures is exponentially-large with respect to the length L of the sequence.
 Why is it then that we cannot even fine-tune these models on single machines?The above estimate includes only per-layer memory and input activations cost and does not take into account the following major sources of memory use in the Transformer.

 Thus, given an image, a capsule network provides a description of its components at various ’levels’ of semantics.
 Famously, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) added translation equivariance to standard multilayer perceptrons (LeCun et al., 1998; Cohen & Welling, 2016).
 We experimentally show that the method is promising and results in a neural network with state-of-theart 78.4% accuracy and 60.5% certified robustness on the challenging CIFAR-10 dataset with 2/255 L∞ perturbation (the best known existing results are 71.5% accuracy and 54.0% certified robustness from concurrent work of Zhang et al., (2020)).
 PFNM further utilizes Bayesian nonparametric methods to adapt to global model size and to heterogeneity in the data.
 To further enable actionable agents to utilize the scores, a neural dynamics model can be learned from the interaction data using self-supervision.
 In fact, crystal structure phase mapping easily becomes too complex for experts to solve and is a major bottleneck in high-throughput materials discovery.
Recently, many stochastic optimization methods solving the composition problem have been developed, such as the stochastic gradient based method and the variance-reduction based method.
 As a result, this has incited significant interest in new mathematical tools that help analyze piecewise linear functions, such as tropical geometry.
In our work, we go beyond structuring the agent’s memory with respect to the agent’s position.
 We achieve this by characterizing and aligning the low dimensional geometric summaries of the inputs and the adversarial examples.
 Although designing robust losses or explicit regularisation is easier and more flexible in practice, the performance is not the optimal yet.
 Hence, it seems that with these standard regularization methods deep networks are wasting capacity (Dauphin & Bengio, 2013).
 With this in mind we re-purpose the framework of harmonic analysis of Boolean functions, widely used in computational learning and computational complexity theory (O’Donnell, 2014; Linial et al., 1993; Mossel et al., 2003; Mansour, 1994).
 For each inner node, the standard RP Tree needs to project all data points into one random vector.
 A feature group is defined as a subset of features that provides a meaningful representation or high-level concept that would help the downstream task.
 To this end, a few methods have recently been proposed for locally interpretable modeling: Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) (Ribeiro et al., 2016), Supervised Local modeling methods (SILO) (Bloniarz et al., 2016), and Model Agnostic Supervised Local Explanations (MAPLE) (Plumb et al., 2018).
 It can suggest better practices for data collection, e.g, what kinds of additional data would the model benefit the most from.
 Patch-based method Li & Wand (2016) can alleviate this problem, but may cause insufficient color.

Coherence and discontinuity inaudio.
To remedy the misalignment, we propose to exploit the class prototypes for adversarial domain alignment, instead of using only the possibly inaccurate predictions.
 The policy can be a single unconditioned policy (Peters & Schaal, 2008) or a latent-condionted policy (Eysenbach et al., 2019).
 As shown in Figure 1, the proposed framework consists of a “recommender” and a “virtual user.
 Specifically, we use this representation to explore the followings.
 (2) Data augmentation with high energy noise can negatively impact the performance on noise-free test examples.
 On the other hand, verification aims to certify/verify for a given DNN that there exists no small perturbation of a given input that can change its output prediction (Katz et al., 2017; Sankaranarayanan et al., 2016; Weng et al., 2018a).
 In the first alternative scheme, an ANN is trained firstly, then it is transformed into the SNN version whose network structure is the same as the abovementioned ANN, and neurons analog the behavior of ANN neurons (Diehl et al., 2015).
 We consider the regression task, optimizing with respect to theL2 loss with random parameter initialization and focus on the over-parametrized regime, meaning that m > n, where n is the number of training samples.
 However, without knowledge of ground-truth class labels, it is difficult for unsupervised approaches to apply attention.
 First, we precisely define the relationship between the standard convolution and the depthwise separable convolution using EHP (Extended HadamardProduct), which is our proposed mathematical formulation to correlate the standard convolution kernel with the depthwise convolution kernel and the pointwise convolution kernel.
 The importance weighted autoencoder (IWAE) (Burda et al., 2016) maximizes a joint lower bound LKψ ≤ pθ(x) whose bias decreases as K → ∞.
 By pruning channels dynamically, different pruned structures can be considered as different routing of data stream inside CNNs.
 However, we find thatthe trusted (high confidence) regions in their confidence map are mostly located on the large target objects, and thus the effectiveness of semi-supervised learning is limited.
 For more information, please refer to Section H in the supplementary materials.
 L1 loss for image generation is known to generate low quality images as the generated images are blurred and lack details Dosovitskiy & Brox (2016).
 WaveGAN (Donahue et al., 2019) was the first and state-of-the-art GAN model that can generate raw waveform audio from scratch.
 In addition to such interpretability, prototypical learning:(1) provides an efficient confidence metric by measuring mismatches in prototype labels, allowing performance to be improved by refraining from making predictions in the absence of sufficient confidence, (2) helps detect deviations in the test distribution by measuring mismatches in prototype labels that represent the support of the training dataset, and (3) enables performance in the high label noise regime to be improved by controlling the number of selected prototypes.
 By registration-at-the-loss, we mean the problem of registering the super-resolved reconstructionto the high-resolution ground-truth prior to computing the loss.
 The placement network transforms the graph representations into a placement decision with soft attention, removing hard constraints such as hierarchicalgrouping of operations (Mirhoseini et al., 2018) or co-location heuristics (to reduce the placement complexity) (Mirhoseini et al., 2017).
Experimental evaluation reveals that models based on the theoretical constructions with high combinatorial power such as WL algorithm performs better than the models without them such as Vertex histogram kernel (Vishwanathan et al., (2010)) on a commonly used data sets.
 Learning rate decay (lrDecay) is a de facto technique for training modern neural networks, where we adopt an initially large learning rate and then decay it by a certain factor after pre-defined epochs.
 In Hinton et al., (2015); Furlanello et al., (2018); Yang et al., (2018a), the authors pointed out that secondary information, i.
 Burt et al., (2019) provide theoretical analysis to show that a relatively small M is sufficient to produce a reliable variational approximation when the input dimension is low.
 More fundamentally, deep neural networks need large amounts of labeled data to train.
 Note that, the mean and the variance are only the first-order and second-order moments, respectively, for a distribution.
Contributions:
 Toward this objective, we propose a multi-task learning framework for time-series data, where each task not only learns its own latent features at each timestep but also aggregates the latent features from the other tasks at the same or different timesteps via attention allocation.
 Asthe warm-up stage happens in the first several iterations, we investigate the optimization behavior at initialization of the Post-LN Transformer.
 To achieve this goal, we firstly demonstrate that lowering gradient Lipschitz constant and gradient variance is the key to boost the convergence rate of optimization algorithms with stochastic gradient methods.
 Since fθ and qφ is an adversarial relationship, this framework is called adversarial invariance induction (AII).
 These conditions prevent us from adopting existing work on transfer RL between different environmental dynamics, as they require access to source environment instances or their dynamics for training a target policy (e.g, Lazaric et al., (2008); Chen et al., (2018); Yu et al., (2019); Tirinzoni et al., (2018)).
 We denote these as shallow metrics, and their inherent problem is that they can not capture structures of any scale or contextual information.
 The second and third components are attention unit (Vaswani et al., 2017; Veličković et al., 2018) and gating units (Cho et al., 2014).
 Furthermore, these problems are mostly introduced because the loss-function of the triplets is based on the differences between the anchor-positive and anchornegative distances, so there is an equivalent effect of encouraging the positive image to be closer or the negative image to be further.
 Since LSTMs are effective at propagating information across the decoding process, the network does not necessarily need to associate particular decoded words with their corresponding image region(s).
 We apply this hard constraining layer to the problem of turbulence superresolution, where we show that training with thehard constraining layer in-the-loop not only guarantees that the imposed constraint is strictly satisfied, but also generates solutions that are more accurate measured via a variety of fluid flow metrics.
 (c) Existing algorithms cannot be readily applied to address the trade-off among model utility, privacy loss, and robustness.
 Prototypical percolation processes include water turning into ice or steam, and the spontaneous emergence of magnetization and superconductivity in metals.
 And in many other RNN’s application scenarios such as traffic forecast and optimal control, the input is a noisyobservation or measurement sequence and the output is an estimate sequence of a certain quantity, e.g, the traffic speed..
 For convenience, we define homologous test data and non-homologous test data here.
 Most of today’sAction sequence with lengthObservation sequence\\xa0 with lengthstate-of-the-art novelty models (e.g, (Savinov et al., 2019; Pathak et al., 2017)) only derive the novelty from local information, e.g, concatenation of few recent frames.
 Table 1 summarizes differences in this work.
 The evaluation performance is in turn exploited to update the controller.
 To solve this problem we propose to lift the problem to a higher dimensional one by treating the parameters defining the interest points as slack variables, and introduce a hard constraint that they must correspond to the output that the heatmap network gives.
 If randomized smoothing can be used to certify `∞-normed robustness, what mechanism is the optimal choice?To shed light on the above questions, we propose in this paper a unified and self-contained framework for randomized smoothing-based certified defenses.
 However, the existing methods require over-parameterized neural networks (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Chaudhry et al., 2018a) or are not flexible enough handle the stochastic nature of the learning process (Lopez-Paz et al., 2017; Chaudhry et al., 2018b) since they did not explicitly consider the model’s performance on the current task and old tasks in the learning process.
The strong continual learning ability of A-GEM relies on the episodic memory which can give a hint on the performance of the current model on old tasks.
The purpose of this paper is to address the aforementioned theoretical and practical issues in the construction of ST -equivariant CNN models.
We summarize the main contributions and advantages of MaskConvNet as follows.
 Zhang et al., (2016; 2017) modeled the whole city are as an entire image and employed residual neural network to capture temporal closeness.
 Our experiments shows that, similar to the results shown in (Shwartz-Ziv & Tishby, 2017), we first (to the best of our knowledge) observe the information extraction-compression phenomena in the context of deep RL (we need to use MINE(Belghazi et al., 2018) for estimating the mutual information).
To this end, we propose a novel input-dependent variational dropout regularization for network sparsification.
To solve these problems, this paper improves the clustering ability of k-means by measuring the similarity between samples and centroids by EVT (Coles et al., 2001).
 However, in CNF, for invertibility, the dimension of the latent code needs to be the same as the dimension of the input data and therefore is substantial, which results in many unnecessary parameters.
 This is wildly inefficient in terms of bit-efficiency: our experiments in Section 5 show that DIMCO’s discrete representation requires roughly 10× less bits per datapoint to achieve similar performance compared to continuous methods.
 Thus it is orthogonal to the study of algorithms for neural network architecture exploration.
The generalization properties of GANs are less explored in the literature, and some exceptions are these works(Jiang et al., 2019; Arora et al., 2017; Bartlett et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017).
 In this case, we define an aspect as an attribute of a product or service (Giannakopoulos et al., 2017), such as Location or Cleanliness for the hotel domain.
 And case3 contains a lot of geographical names, which make it possible to be misclassified as geographic topics.
The first major problem of GANs is how to measure the difference between the generated distribution and the true data distribution.
 They fail to incorporate the existence and effect of human interference: medications, therapies, surgeries, etc.
 Plausible deep learning approaches based on reinforcement learning however are lacking.
 (See Figure 1 for two examples.)When the approximability gap occurs, any deep RL algorithms with policies parameterized by neural networks will suffer from a sub-optimal performance.
 This enforces that the latent vector z preserves the encoded style information when translated from an image i to another image j and back to image i again.
In this work, we introduce novel visual attention mechanisms by endowing them with a new capability: that of selecting only the relevant features of the image.
 Li et al., (2018) for example, proposed the NETT (Network Tikhonov) approach to inverse problems.
In this paper, we propose a new approach called Iterative Proportional Clipping (IPC) to generate audio adversarial examples which are not only imperceptible to the humans but also more robustagainst existing defense mechanisms.
 Similar schedules are used for BERT (Devlin et al., (2018)) pre-training, while BERT fine-tuning uses a linear decay.
 However, these techniques are either not theoretically guaranteed in terms of approximation error, or thy require at least a linear time computation cost.
 TS algorithm is reported to convergences slowly to the optimal solution Hill et al., (2017) when dealing with MultivariateMAB problem.
 A regular convolution is now decomposed into two steps.
 Furthermore, given the computational complexity and difficulty in GAN training, a natural way to promote scalability is to consider parallelism Intrator et al., (2018); Durugkar et al., (2016).
 These challenges highlight the need for more relaxed learning approaches that are less dependent on the exact location of labels for training.
 The recently proposed GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017) learns a convolution kernel in an inductive manner.
This leaves a gap between the theory for multi-source adaptation and theoretically sound algorithm for domain aggregation.
To apply XLDA to any natural language input, we simply take a portion of that input and replace it with its translation in another language.
For example, ZO optimization serves as a powerful and practical tool for generation of black-box adversarial examples to evaluate the adversarial robustness of ML/DL models (Chen et al., 2017; Ilyas et al., 2018; Tu et al., 2018; Ilyas et al., 2019).
MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS
 In our experiments, we have observed that the standard embeddings can be replaced by TT–embeddings with the compression ratio of 1− 3 orders without any significant drop (and sometimes even with a slight gain) of the metric of interest.
 To keep the number of parameters fixed in the attention layer, each head projects the data into a lower dimensional subspace, dimension of which scales as 1/(number of heads), and computes the self attention in this subspace.
Hsu et al., (2019) and Zhang et al., (2019) use a variational approach (Kingma & Welling, 2014) to tackle the style task.
A key bottleneck in training models with Scheduled Sampling is its inherently sequential nature.
 Developing such knowledge is very difficult for various words and attributes in practice.
 In this setting, some of the stochastic gradients are much larger than the mean and can excessively influence the updates of SGD.
 Using generative models, compounds hypothesized to have specific properties can be rapidly generated and then a targeted subset of these can be experimentally tested.
KD has been extensively studied in NLP (Kim & Rush, 2016; Hu et al., 2018), while designing KD methods for BERT has been less explored.
 This is often a cumbersome task involving tuning hyperparameters of the distance function (Kandasamy et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2018).
ResNet, VGG, and MobileNet) and datasets (CIFAR and ImageNet) and have the following nontrivial and novel contributions:
 The large body of work on learning disentangled representations tackles this problem in several settings; fully supervised, weakly supervised and unsupervised, depending on the available data (Tran et al., 2018; Reed et al., 2014; Jha et al., 2018; Mathieu et al., 2016; Higgins et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Kim & Mnih, 2018; Chen et al., 2016; Nguyen-Phuoc et al., 2019; Narayanaswamy et al., 2017).
Another class of generative models employs an encoder-decoder structure and low dimensional latent variables to represent and generate the data.
To fulfil the above requirements, we need to address the following difficulties: (1) How to guarantee both diversity and naturalness, which is usually trade-off in the domain of generation (Srivastava et al., 2015)? (2) How to achieve long-range behaviour synthesis, which is stuck by error accumulation problem in many temporal modelling tasks (Denton & Fergus, 2018)? (3) How to generate unseen behaviours without loss of diversity or naturalness, which is hardly addressed in previous researches? As shown in Fig 1, the current two main branches of motion generation methods, i.g,, parametric and non-parametric, are yet to deal with these difficulties properly.
 Stereo matching is one of the basic vision tasks.
 We propose the BI-SENT2VEC algorithm, which extends the SENT2VEC algorithm (Pagliardini et al., 2018; Gupta et al., 2019) to the cross-lingual setting.
 They have demonstrated great performances in several tasks, such as link prediction, molecular property optimization, and network structure optimization (Li et al., 2018; You et al., 2018b; Grover et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2018; You et al., 2018a; Liu et al., 2018; Simonovsky & Komodakis, 2018; Wang et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018).
In order to solve the previous issues, in this article, we propose a deep learning wrapper algorithm that equips any black-box model with uncertainty prediction.
 To understand the behavior of weight sharing approaches, we use a small search space, which makes it possible to have ground truth for comparison.
 The large batches are then discarded, and the sub-sampled, smaller, batches are used to train the GAN.
 Here, the “embedding” stands for delay/shift-embedding (i.g,, Hankelization) which is a copy/duplication operation of image-patches by sliding window of patch size (τ, τ).
 Inspired by this new attention network, we propose U2GNN – a novel universal self-attention graph neural network to learn plausible node and graph embeddings.
 In particular, a recent study (Frankle & Carbin, 2019) created the lottery ticket hypothesis based on empirical observations: “dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks (winning tickets) that – when trained in isolation – reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations".
 To this end, this paper studies a new paradigm – Boosting network (BoN), where one starts from simple models, delving into complex trained models progressively.
 We will examine the impact of transition dropout (inspired by Srivastava et al., (2014) and Freeman et al., (2019)) and its theoretical implications.
 Studies on applying existing parser system on morphologically rich languages were conducted inAsker (2010) and marton; Nizar Habash; Owen Ranbow (2012).
 When treating patients with sepsis, for example, the only available signal is the mortality of the patient at the end of the treatment (Komorowski et al., 2018).
 For example, let us say that the goal is to learn MNIST sequentially with two batches: using only the data from the first five classes and then only the data from the remaining five other classes.
Commonly used PET reconstruction algorithms are analytic method (K, 2000) and statistical method (Shepp & Vardi, 2007).
 Liu et al., (2019) proposes an invertible-flow based graph generation model.
 One such metric in the literature is the inference speed when the model is executed on specific hardware.
 While most initialization techniques are designed to maintain the squared length of intermediate activations through the layers, the multiplication of i.i.d random weights along input-to-output paths in increasingly deep networks might lead to unbounded higher order statistics.
 Differently, we then place a non-informative prior on activation distribution and derive an activation regularizer that directly encourages high activation variability via preferring high-entropy activations.
 While prior work uses AST paths to read programs (Alon et al., 2019a), we generate code by producing the target AST node-by-node.
The utterance in (1) has a number of direct implications that are logically entailed by the utterance above, such as the implication that the hearer is standing on a body part of the speaker, and the implication that the speaker is touching the hearer.
 The first one is bridging the distributions by matching all their statistics (Long et al., 2015; 2017; Pan et al., 2009).
 While this group can be parameterized with a single variable, the wrap-around occuring between zero and 360 degrees makes it difficult to model it directly.
 Third, the model can be inherently complex for any existing algorithm to be effective.
 Due to a combined loss function,Figure 1: Overview of the proposed model MoE-Sim-VAE.
 Conventional distillation method requires pre-training a powerful teacher network and performs an one-way transfer to a relatively small and untrained student network.
Furthermore, we demonstrate by experiments that current deep learning models rely heavily on optimizing the lower order non-robust component to generalize, which is a major underlying reason for the adversarial behavior.
 An overview of GDA is shown in Figure 1.
 Moreover, designing statistics as neural networks allows a more fine-grained description of the data, opening the doors to applications of our model to the generative setting.
In this work we aim to collect credible samples from self-interested agents via studying the problem of sample elicitation.
Output perturbation (Wu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017) first runs the learning algorithm the same as in the non-private case then adds noise to the output parameter.
 Note that the direct approach naturally captures the aleatoric uncertainty (inherent observation noise), but captures less the epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty in the model) (Kendall & Gal, 2017).
 A standardization of the evaluation procedure is needed to make DRL that matters as pointed out by Henderson et al., (2018) for the Mujoco benchmark (Todorov et al., 2012): the authors criticize the lack of reproducibility and discuss how to allow for a fair comparison in DRL that is consistent between articles.
 Moreover, the treatment assignment is non-randomand instead is assigned according to the features associated with each sample.
 As a consequence, repeatable and fair evaluation is a “pain-point” within the community (Gundersen et al., 2018; Plesser, 2018; Ghanta et al., 2018; Hutson, 2018; Li & Talwalkar, 2019; Tatman et al., 2018; Reproducibility in Machine Learning; ICLR Reproducibility Challenge).
In this work, we learn a classifier from few clean labeled examples and additional weakly labeled data, while the representation is learned on different classes, as in few-shot learning.
Contributions
FURL defines the concepts of federated and private parameters: the latter remain on the user device instead of being transferred to the server.
 Our work combines aspects from both domain adaptation and domain randomization, in that we maintain the notion of randomized environments but use a regularization method to achieve good generalization over the randomization space.
 PGD perturbs a normal example x0 by iteratively updating it in the steepest ascent direction for a totalof K times.
 Thus, the information of mobile real-taken images is under-informative than its actual image size.
 However, not all saliency maps are equally informative (Fong & Vedaldi, 2017).
 Due to the influence of shooting angle and distance, the purpose of keypoints of vehicles visible in the sample is not fixed and fluctuates violently.
 Momentum helps speed up learning in directions of low curvature, without becoming unstable in directions of high curvature.
 This non-parametric property enables our proposed CNN models to be significantly compressed in terms of the number of parameters, leading to get the advantages (i.g, efficient distributed training, less communication between server and clients) referred by Iandola et al., (2016).
 The first is the difficulty in scaling the number of models for ensemble AL.
 A novel type of denoising autoencoder (DAE) (Vincent et al., 2010) is proposed to distill both high- and low-level representations accordingly.
 Therefore, it is non-trivial to break the limitations of existing work and develop capable and extendable framework for solving multi-output learning tasks.
 For each sample, only one random instance of each layer is activated during generation.
The main challenge in WGANs is estimating the Wasserstein metric, consisting of estimating expected values of the discriminator from samples (drawn from a model distribution and a given data distribution), and optimizing the discriminator to maximize an expression of these expectedvalues.
In this paper, we are the first to adapt the self-attention mechanism to impute missing data in multivariate time series, which cover multiple geo-locations and contain multiple measurements asUnder review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020Completed\\xa0Value Available\\xa0ObservationMissing\\xa0ValueData\\xa0Imputation Model (a) Location (L) Time (T) Measurement\\xa0(M) Location (L) Time (T) Measurement\\xa0(M) (c)Temporal\\xa0Only\\xa0 (Traditional)Cross‐Dimensional\\xa0 (Ours)(L) (T) (M)(L)(T)(M)QueryKeyValueWeighted\\xa0Sum(b)Attention\\xa0(Q,K,V)Attention\\xa0Mapshown in fig.  1(a).
 However, since the new adopted shaping reward yields no direct dependence on the current policy, this branch of methods, updating policy over demonstrated states in the same way as others by the reshaped value function, overlook the validity of such direct supervision for demonstrated states when learning the policy.
Another aspect for improvement of Mask R-CNN in multi-task learning is about the parallel isolated branches of Mask R-CNN.
Previously, binary-coding-based quantization has only permitted integer numbers of quantization bits, limiting the compression/accuracy trade-off search space, especially in the range of very low quantization bits.
 This solution is a coarse approximation to the original problem as show in Section 6 of this work and in Doe (2019).
 To the best of ourknowledge, only the very recent work of Ozbulak et al., (2019) adress this issue.
 Moreover, unlike previous work (Yoon et al., 2017; Baytas et al., 2017; Binkowski et al., 2018; Che et al., 2018), DISE integrates not only relative time information (the time between observations), but also absolute time information, which helps the model learn non-stationary properties of the signal.
 More precisely, they use the first L − 1 layers of a DNN as a feature map, which transforms contexts from the raw input space to a low-dimensional space, usually with better representation and less frequent update.
To reduce the testing cost, it is desirable to have an early estimation of the performance of a DL model by using only a small amount of testing data.
 They represent transport maps between the input distribution p(x) and a prescribed, easy-to-samplefrom latent distribution p(z).
In recent years, the development of deep learning has provided a new way to solve this problem.
Unsupervised extractive models.
 This scenario prevents ”cross-talk” between classifier units by not sharing them, which would otherwise rapidly decay the accuracy (Zenke et al., 2017; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Rusu et al., 2016; Shin et al., 2017; Gepperth & Karaoguz, 2016; Rebuffi et al., 2017; Achille et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2018) as newly introduced classes directly impact and confuse existing concepts.
 Moreover, we find that this problem described above can be remedied simply with an additional penalty term on the variance of a sampled representation.
 In GAN, good semi-supervised learning performance will lead to a mismatch between the generated results and the real data distribution (Dai et al., 2017).
 However, when the number of tasks are large, the regularization of past tasks becomes obsolete, leading to representation drift (Titsias et al., 2019).
 A recent study by Locatello1Codes available at. (2018) carefully compared these approaches based on extensive experiments.
1Videos comparing the policy behaviours of APRiL to the asymmetric DDPG baseline can be found hereBy introducing Attention Privileged Reinforcement Learning (APRiL), we aim to further leverage access to exact states.
 Our contributions are the following:
 For metric constrained problems, however, we have many more constraints than data points, so the condition numbers of the problems are quite high and these algorithms tend to require a large number of iterations.
1We will make the code publicly available upon acceptance.
In this work, we propose Prototypical Random Walks (PRW), as an effective graph-based learning signal derived from unlabelled data.
 We then fine-tune both English and target model to obtain the bilingual LM.
 In contrast, when powerfulpretrained language encoders are integrated into our agent, we find that agents can satisfy human instructions with substantially above-chance accuracy.
 By design, PCA yields the highest global score among all the DR methods and high values of global score indicates the efficacy of a DR method in reflecting the global structure.
Another, more intuitive explanation for generalization is that the function generalizes well if the extracted features encode a semantic similarity of the input that is robust to small changes—both in the input and the features.
 Since obtaining more private training samples will generally be nontrivial, we focus on using ‘public’ data to augment the training set.
 This approach is not tractable for finite T and n and therefore does not allow, for example, the study of transient behavior.
During training, the learning algorithms only have access to a batch of existing data collected a priori from a family of Markov Decision Process (MDP).
We will evaluate these two types of models (3D CNN and C-LSTM) on tasks where temporal order is crucial.
A standard practice when studying out-of-distribution detection is to evaluate the detection performance when examples from other datasets are mixed into the test set (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016).
 The NCBI Taxonomy maintains a tree ontology of taxonomic labels (Wheeler et al., 2006).
 By leveraging the modeling and learning capability of GNNs and considering multidimensional uncertainties in SL, we propose a Bayesian DL framework that allows simultaneous estimation of different uncertainty types associated with the predicted class probabilities of the test nodes generated by GNNs.
 Furthermore, the critic can leverage extradata sources for training, e.g, a paraphrase dataset and allow for better transfer learning.
 Adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Madry et al., 2017) on the other hand aims to learn models whose predictions are invariant under small perturbations that are humanly imperceptible.
 The convergence rates are derived with a key contraction property of the sparsification operator Compk (Topk or Randk) (Stich et al., 2018; Alistarh et al., 2018), that isEC ‖x− Compk(x)‖2 ≤ (1− k/d)‖x‖2,∀x ∈ Rd, (3) where EC is the expectation taking on the compressor and ‖ · ‖ is the `2-norm.
Contributions.
 These constraints can not be simply incorporated using syntactic restrictions over the grammar of expressions.
 Furthermore, a consensus in the highdimensional data analysis community is that, a method working well on the high-dimensional data is because the data is not really of high-dimension (Levina & Bickel, 2005).
 Unfortunately, choosing a suitable divergence objective for a specific task is challenging as it requires a thorough understanding of (i) the shape of the target distribution; (ii) the desirable properties of the approximate distribution (e.g, mass-covering or mode-seeking); and (iii) the bias-variance trade-off between the tightness and the variance of the Monte Carlo estimate of the variational bound.
While these results do give important insights, they do not fully explain the dynamics of SGD on neural nets, and how they relate to overparameterization.
Code is available at an anonymous link.
Procedurally, ALI-G is close to many existing algorithms, such as Deep Frank-Wolfe (Berrada et al., 2019), APROX (Asi & Duchi, 2019) and L4 (Rolinek & Martius, 2018).
To address this, we provide five representative and diverse remote sensing datasets in a standardized form for easy reuse.
If the classifier f(.) was linear, the distance of an input point x to its decision boundary (i.g, the robustness certificate) can be computed efficiently using a convex optimization.
 These outputs are produced by unique execution paths through the model.
Inspired by this ability of biological creatures, we seek to answer the question: Will learning to combine intrinsic adaptation reward with environment reward lead to more efficient transfer of policies between domains? Imitation Learning (IL) (Duan et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2018) seems to play a crucial part in biological learning, and as such has been widely studied in RL.
 On the other hand, conventional neural network architectures based on stacked convolutional or multilayer perceptrons, may not be the best fit for tabular data decision manifolds due to being vastly overparametrized – the lack of appropriate inductive bias often causes them to fail to find robust solutions for tabular decision manifolds (Goodfellow et al., 2016).
Such a search space enhancement is critical since NAS is enabled to explore stronger and previously undiscovered network architectures, which opens a door to potentially take the NAS research to thenext level.
Our Contributions:
 Merrill (2019); Suzgun et al., (2019); Weiss et al., (2018) also all report experimental results suggesting that some class of counter languages matches the learnable capacity of LSTMs trained by gradient descent.
 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.
 Therefore we argue that the incapability for causal reasoning (Pearl & Mackenzie, 2018; Gopnik et al., 2004) is the reason of DNN’s vulnerability to (adversarial) data manipulations.
 Though somewhat restricted, the teacher-student setting allows for assessing performance by comparing the parameters of the networks.
 We devise several objective functions, as well as deep neural-network architectures for parameterizing the approximating function class, for learning the gradient of the potential function.
 Wu et al., (2019) and Tom Beucler (2019) introduced statistical and physical constraints in the loss function to regularize the predictions of the model.
In this paper, we propose a new class of loss functions in quantization to improve the performance of MIPS.
 However, these datasets do not provide true labels for the training images.
Embedding-based models (Nguyen, 2017) have proved to be effective for knowledge graph completion.
 Notably, randomized smoothing with adversarial training has shown great promise for rigorous certification against attacks in the `2 norm (Salman et al., 2019), although it is not yet clear how randomized smoothing may be adapted to other norms.
 Considering this role during training, gradients can provide a complementary perspective with respect to activation and characterize missing information that the network has not learned for each unseen image.
At first glance, this may seem like an artificial dilemma – surely one could just avoid the problem by not adding such sensitive attributes to the model.
 Related to our approach, Rothe et al., (2017) proposed a powerful question-asking framework by modeling questions as symbolic programs, but their algorithm relies on hand-designed program features and requires expensive calculations to ask questions.
 To achieve this goal, we propose a novel Context-Aware Style Transfer (CAST) model, by jointly considering style transfer and context alignment.
 In the following sections we show how to derive practical regularization terms from these premises and meticulously evaluate them1.
 Following this line of research, in this work:
 Figure 1a shows how the attribute distribution over neighbourhoods at different scales can indicate nodes with similar network roles even if they are distant in the network, or even in different networks.
 Our approach can be thought of as a kind of Actor-Critic approach where the “Actor” is a student model asking for advice when learning to generate every single token and the “Critic” is a teacher model that gives logq(yt|y<t,x)) as rewards.
 We identify out-of-distribution examples by jointly considering the class assigned at the output layer and the activity patterns in the intermediate layers.
 One needs to not only learn the translation mapping in the local information (i.g, neighborhood pattern of each node), but also in the global property of the whole graph (e.g,node degree distribution or graph density).
 Broadly, in these methods, the behavior of policy is iteratively updated using the trajectories generated by an expert policy.
 More specifically, CRF models the label assignment problem as a probabilistic inference problem such that constraints can be incorporated, for example, the label agreement between similar pixels in image segmentation.
 The tree-LSTM uses dependency tree information extracted using an external dependency parser to model relations between entities.
 Examples include pixel-space sensitivity map methods (Simonyan et al., 2013; Zeiler & Fergus, 2014; Springenberg et al., 2014; Smilkov et al., 2017; Sundararajan et al., 2017) and class-discriminative localization methods (Zhou et al., 2016; Selvaraju et al., 2017; Chattopadhay et al., 2018; Petsiuk et al., 2018), where the former evaluates the sensitivity of a network classification decision to pixel variations at the input, and the latter localizes which parts of an input image were looked at by the network for making a classification decision.
 An alternative way is to introduce a forward decoder from latent space to image space, aiming to globally invert the representation.
 Therefore, we take a step forward to investigate ways to make DNNs as similar to GLMs as possible for interpretability purpose while maintaining competitive performance.
 The proposed pruning method, however, does not involve retraining of the pruned network.
 Black-box decisionbased attacks (Brendel et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019) require less information than the score-based attacks.
 In Figure 1, we want to cluster 6 images from CIFAR-10 dataset into two clusters.
 The first method will decrease performance, obviously, since some useful information placing behind the maximum sequence length is discarded by truncating. e.g, for text summarization, if the key point sentence locates at the end of the document, it never be recalledeven though the model is powerful.
 Many SR methods regarding to the real-world condition images have been already developed, such as Zhang et al., (2018a); Yuan et al., (2018).
 A core component of this approach is the density estimator, which we derive from the theory of denoising autoencoders, hence our term denoising density estimator.
 Manufacturing processes involve a number of additional criteria — such as green chemistry (having low detrimental effects on the environment).
 Lastly, each subroutine must be performed accurately enough so that composition results in accurate inference over long runs of the program.
 Given exact predictions for all actors, the self-driving car can invoke a motion planner to find a collision-free path.
 For example, consider the goal of an artificial agent acting indistinguishably from a human: the famous Turing Test.
 To this end, we propose a novel framework by combining Monte Carlotree search (MCTS) with a basic OR method (2-opt based local search) using variable neighborhood strategy to solve the TSP.
 Extrapolation error is particularly problematic in high-dimensional state and action spaces (such as those inherent in language generation).
 In the case of the SPE, the embeddings and prototypes are Gaussian random variables, each class instance is assumed to be a Gaussian perturbation of the prototype, and a query instance is classified by marginalizing over the embedding uncertainty.
 Thus, learning in a sparse reward setting (reward is only defined for a small subset of states) is a fundamental challenge for RL agents to perform ROS well, especially dealing with real-world scenarios and in complex environments.
 Truncation is unsuitable because long complex text often contains inter-referential pieces of information.
 Additionally, RRAM endurance is on the order of 106 writes (Grossi et al., 2019), shortening the lifetime of a device due to memory writes for on-chip training.
 Inspired by the recent progress in Neural Ordinary Diferential Equations (NODEs) (Chen et al., 2018; Dupont et al., 2019; Gholami et al., 2019), we propose to use NODEs to solve the level set formulation of the contour evolution, thus learning the forcing function in an end-to-end data driven manner.
Inspired by the success of pre-trained contextual embeddings for natural languages, we present the first attempt to apply the underlying techniques to source code.
 Second, we numerically examine if explanations created by NormLIME accurately capture characteristics of the machine learning problem at hand, using the same intuition proposed by Hooker et al., (2018).
 In order to find out where the limitation of GNNis and why, in learning logical reasoning problems, we decide to look at problems with complexity inbetween SAT and predicate logic problems, for which QBF (Quantified Boolean Formula) problems serve as excellent middle steps.
 To the best of our knowledge, previous works assumed that samples cover a broad spectrum of difficulty and hence need to be categorized and presented in a specific order.
 However, the dimension of latent space for flow based generative models is same as the high-dimensional input space, by virtue of bijectivity nature of flows.
 This issue is known as the planning horizon dilemma (Wang et al., 2019).
 The first comes from the loss of sequential information of positions as it treats every position identically.
Unlike for faces and bodies, the representation graph in sport is dynamic as players constantly move and switch positions.
 For tasks where incorrect predictions can harm human welfare, it is critical that we understand when a machine learning model is qualified to make decisions on real world inputs.
We present a general HRL framework TAIC (Temporal Abstraction with Information-theoretic Constraints), which allows an agent to learn the temporal abstraction from past experiences or expert demonstrations without task-specific knowledge.
 In particular, we learn new pivoting rule policies that combine existing hand-designed heuristics by training on large data sets of LP relaxations of randomly generated instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
Besides, a recent line of work (Greff et al., 2017; van Steenkiste et al., 2018; Eslami et al., 2016; Kosiorek et al., 2018; Greff et al., 2019; Burgess et al., 2019) has focused on unsupervised ways to decompose a raw visual scene in terms of objects.
 Also, it is among the goals of the latent variable modelling to model the description of data in terms of uncorrelated or independent components.
There are also some learning-based attempts for the packing problem, which utilize reinforcement learning in the neural network model since the optimal solution is unknown beforehand.
To recognize unseen attribute-object pairs, conventional methods (Chen & Grauman, 2014; Misra et al., 2017) typically learn attribute classifiers and object classifiers at the first, and then recognize unseen pairs by composing these separately-trained classifiers, which ignore the inner relationship between attributes and objects.
 However, on tasks such as NLI and NMT uniform attention weights degrades the performance substantially, indicating that attention is a crucial component of the model for these tasks and hence the analysis of attention’s interpretability here is more reasonable.
 This trade-off is observed even with a small training .
 Echoing to the above problem of aggregating human judgements, we face similar challenge when aggregating classifiers’ predictions in machine learning.
 Algorithm 1 describes a popular technique called “‘Gaussian smoothing”.
 For two given images, a variant of Grad-CAM has been used for visualization of image retrieval (Gordo & Larlus (2017)) by computing the gradient from the cosine similarity of the embedding features to the last convolutional layers of both images.
 However, these methods just utilize the sequential representations of the molecule, while ignoring the natural topological connections between atoms within the molecule.
 We denote Xi,u to be the number of times word u ∈ {1, . , d} appears for subject i ∈ {1, . ,n}.
Many unsupervised landmark learning methods perturb an input training image with various transformations, then require the model to learn semantic correspondences across the transformed variants to piece together the unaltered input image.
 Alternative non-Bayesian methods have been recently developed — mostly based on ad-hoc ensemble approaches (Lakshminarayanan et al., (2017)) — but formal frequentist methods with rigorous theoretical guarantees are still lacking.
 Simple log-linear potential functions are commonly used in traditional probabilistic graphical models (Sutton et al., (2012)).
 Similarly, the negative examples that are not similar to the positive examples are refered to as easy-negative examples.
 This approach paves a new hope of reducing false positive rates beyond the theoretical limit, by using context-specific information in the form of a machine learning model (Hsu et al., 2019).
 This, however, is non-trivial for differentially private neural networks, especially when we need to balance privacy and utility.
 The earliest proposed methods relied solely on deterministic clustering of the graphs, making them non-differentiable and task-independent (Jin et al., 2018; Dafna and Guestrin, 2009; von Luxburg, 2007; Ma et al., 2019).
Imagine a student is learning how to draw a horse.
SAEs can also be viewed as outcomes of perturbations in a “rich” semantic feature space (e.g,, texture of the image) rather than just the concrete feature space (e.g,, pixels).
 These techniques are also often guaranteed to find a solution in finite time if one exists (Karaman & Frazzoli, 2011).
This empirical finding is notable since the neural attention- and memory-based techniques have been steadily improving on standard metrics like perplexity and, in some cases, even produce remarkably coherent text (often with some heuristics to reject poor generations).
 As pointed out by Liu et al., (2018) that the feature embedding of elements lies close to the centroid of their corresponding class are the representatives, while features far away or closer to other classes are the confusing ones whichare not discriminative enough.
 This is the main cause of slowness with conventional black-box methods.
 We first introduce a novel advantage estimator that can utilize the independence property by importance sampling.
 This paper shows that these unimportant channels are inhibited channels, which usuallyassociated with small values of γ in Eqn.
 We are interested in learning a generative model of the formpθ(s1:T , z1:T ,x1:T |u1:T ) from partial observations, namely (x1:T ,u1:T ).
 This family of loss functions builds on approaches developed in the peer prediction literature (Miller et al., 2005; Dasgupta & Ghosh, 2013; Shnayder et al., 2016),which studies how to elicit information from self-interested agents without verification.
 Therefore, the cluster assignments are optimized such that patients in a cluster share similar future outcomes to provide a prognostic value.
 The second component, consists of a function f , typically a deep neural-network (Schmidhuber, 2015; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Mikolov et al., 2010) which maps the embedding representation for different NLP problems (machine-translation, summarization, question-answering and others), to the output-space of function f .
 Several works have proposed a priori structured sparsity (Prabhu et al., 2017; Isakov et al., 2018) or weight sharing (Ding et al., 2017) to allow training simpler but ‘wider’ models.
 Another direction of research notices the sparsity of real-world networks and exploits the clustering structure of the graph.
On the other hand, people recently found that for largely over-parameterized neural networks, e.g, more complex modern convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures such as VGGNet (He et al., 2016), ResNet (He et al., 2016), Wide ResNet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016), DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017), training with Adam or its variants typically generalizes worse than SGD with momentum, even when the training performance is better.
One step further, based on the stability argument, we show that if the network is properly overparameterized, gradient descent is guaranteed to find global minima for training ResNet with τ ≤ 1/Ω̃( √ L), where the range of τ is significantly enlarged compared to the result in Allen-Zhu et al.,1We use Ω̃(·) to hide logarithmic factor.(2018b); Du et al., (2018) with τ ≤ 1/Ω(L).
 One notable exception is the recent work on “target driven instance detection” that uses a Siamese architecture similar to those used in tracking to detect particular instances of objects (Ammirato et al., 2018).
 The architecture distribution parameters are jointly optimized during the supernet training via gradient based methods.
 To understand the behaviour of a classifier, the discriminative scores over all supporting features are preferred.
 However, sparse prior is ignored to a large extent in SRCNN for it adopts a generic architecture without considering the domain expertise.
 However, models relying on superficial statistics (non-robust features) can be brittle and generalize poorly, thus suffering from adversarial attacks (Ilyas et al., 2019).
 Hyper-parameter optimization problem can be formulated asmin λ,w L(M(w;λ),D) = min λ L(M(w∗;λ),D),where w∗ = A(L(M(w;λ),D)), (1)and A is an algorithm minimizing loss function w.r.t.w.
 Furthermore, deep learning is becoming a popular toolboth for making MD simulations more accurate and for analyzing data produced in the simulations.
 We call this framework perceptual generative autoencoder (PGA).
 For different layers, many cursors will be adaptively searched during the NAS process.
 Therefore, the key issue in network defense is to randomize or destroy the sophisticated pattern of the attack noise while preserving the original image content.
 Such simplification not only improves GCN’s computational speed and accuracy in a wide range of problems but also allows a better understanding of the GCN model.
 Notably, we postulate that this formulation brings about benefits pertaining to modeling data that is instrinsically hierarchical (recursive) in nature, e.g, natural language, music and logic, an increasingly prosperous and emerging area of research (Shen et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Choi et al., 2018).
 Additionally, we propose extensions to Mirman et al., (2018); Gowal et al., (2018) that allow us to train auto-regressive GRUs/RNNs to certifiably satisfy temporal specifications.
 Since it cares about the image marginal distribution exclusively, it fails to capture intra-conditioning diversity when changes only affect the image-conditioning joint distribution.
 Yu et al., (2019) shares weights among different subnetworks and each sub-network has its own batch normalization layer.
 Having a general recipe for blending physics and learning is an important step in adopting physics-based learning to encompass the wide range of physical problems, where priors are only approximate and training data can be sparse.
Modelling both fine-grained details and high-level structure in high-dimensional distributions is known to be challenging for autoregressive models.
As a baseline contribution, we demonstrate the feasibility of capturing error-potentials of a human observer watching an agent learning to play several different Atari-games, and then decoding the signals appropriately and using them as an auxiliary reward function to a DRL algorithm.
 Further, methods proposed in Cai et al., (2017); Gao et al., (2018) only combine the scores using simple linear weighted-sum, which do not solve these problems principally.
 While this latter type of approach diminishes the risk-disparity gap, it does so by degrading performance on advantaged groups, the previously disadvantaged groups do not directly benefit from this treatment.
 GANs attempt to generate new datapoints from the distribution underlying a given dataset and have achieved impressive fidelity for a variety of data types including images (Goodfellow et al., 2014), text (Yu et al., 2017), and electronic health records (Choi et al., 2017).
 In the generative GMM, methods that optimize M during learning exist (Crouse et al., 2011; Štepánová & Vavrečka, 2018).
 Traffic observations in the interior areas of S1, S2 and S3 may be quite close to each other, whereas observations along U1, U2, and U3 may have much larger variations.
 Such shared information presents opportunities for causal reconstruction to alleviate overfitting and to do inductive reasoning.
In this work we introduce the Hierarchical Bayes Autoencoder (HBAE).
 These two incorporations of compositionality are typically seen as distinct, with very different underlying implementations.
State-of-Art Deep Learning Methods for Outlier Detection.
 We use these metrics to evaluate and compare widely used explainers such as LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016), Grad-CAM (Selvaraju et al., 2016), SmoothGrad (Smilkov et al., 2017) and Integrated Gradients (Sundararajan et al., 2017) on an Inception-V3 (Szegedy et al., 2015) model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset (ILSVRC2012) (Deng et al., 2009), in an objective manner (i.g,, without the need of a human-in-the-loop).
Previous explanation models can successfully describe relationships between objects in the image.
 Fawzi et al.,(2018) proves that adversarial examples exist for any classifiers and can be transferred across different models, making it impossible to design network architectures free from adversarial attacks.
The key contributions of our work can be summarized as:
 For instance, it is trivial to write programmatic labeling functions for the two styles—speed and destination—depicted in Figure 1.
 In N-pair loss, a positive pair interacts with all negative pairs.
 Third, mostly unimodal imputation such as image in-painting has been explored for high-dimensional data (Ivanov et al., 2019; Mattei & Frellsen, 2019).
 However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these methods exploit the high amount of interdependence between the feature maps and spatial locations of the compute activations.
Another direction to augment ConvLSTM is to incorporate a higher-order RNNs (Soltani & Jiang, 2016) inside each LSTM cell, where its hidden state is updated using multiple past steps.
 However, even though an additional 10 epochs of training are required, an accuracy loss of around 1-2% is still observed.
 In particular, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), the graph counterpart of CNNs, have been shown to be effective at exploiting the same translation-equivariance bias as the CNNs over the neighborhoods induced by the graph.
 We model the feature distributionsas Gaussin mixture distributions, which facilitates us to measure the discrepancy between the source and target domains.
 This creates weight symmetry in the loss landscape.
 We consider a supervised-learning problem with m pairs of observations (Xi, Yi) where Xi are regarded as pdimensional vectors, and Xi can divided to n coordinates and each of them have D = p/n dimension.
 Based on such analysis, we provide theoretical explanation the behavior of α and derive a method to automatically find its optimal value.
Despite the achievements of these previous works on posteriors and priors, the state-of-the-art VAE models with continuous latent variables all rely on deep hierarchical latent variables1, although some of them might have used complicated posteriors/priors as components in their architectures.
 In fact, analytical invertibility as provided by some invertible architectures does not necessarily imply numerical invertibility in practice.
 As a result, the variance of the Gaussian noise needs to be sufficiently small to yield good approximation to the original classifiers (by squeezing the “soap bubble” towards the center point),which, however, makes it difficult to verify due to the small noise.
 This strategy is also be useful in human-in-the-loop systems where one can warn the human annotator that a label is suspicious, and automatically propose new labels based on its nearest neighbors’ labels.
 This can give a bird’s eye view of the algorithm and can be useful for comparing two algorithms based on, say, the “volume” of the Pareto front (Li et al., 2015).
In summary, our main contributions are:
 The key challenge, however, is the task of training expressive posterior approximations that can capture the true posterior without significantly increasing the computational costs.
 Consequently, information becomes localized and access toglobal information is restricted (Xu et al., 2018), leading to poor performance on datasets in which only a small portion is labeled (Li et al., 2018).
 Chen et al., (2019) propose L- and C-Shapley procedures which can reliably approximate the Shapley values in linear time with respect to the number of features.
 On the contrary, there are no statistical difference for human behaviors on both texture rich objects and global shape dominating objects in psychophysical trials.
 A learning criterion therefore must trade off accuracy, complexity and invariance.
 Unfortunately, the proposed algorithms use tabular representations of Q-functions, so while this establishes foundations for delusional bias, the function approximator is used neither for generalization nor to manage the size of the state/action space.
 Approaches like random projection and autoencoder are very efficient but they often fail to capture complex class structures due to its underlying data assumption or weak supervisory signal.
This work presents an attempt at reconciling interpretability and predictive performance on the sepsis prediction task and makes the following contributions
 As we demonstrate in Figure 1(a), the perturbation of converged adversarial examples for a neural network are quite different for different initialization configurations, and this phenomenon becomes more severe when it comes to discrete models such as GBDTs (see Figure 1(b)).
 And in each mini-batch of data, each network is updated using the other network’s small-loss instances.
 It involves stacking neural networks (NN) such that the output from a previous one becomes input for the next.
Figure 1 illustrates a key step and a non-key step in Atari Pong, where the main difference between them is whether the ball has already passed through the agent.
 However, there are no theoretical guarantees that the user-defined kernel is the ‘right’ kernel for embedded features.
 For e.g, if the left room was full of lava, where the robot would die, thinking of the middle red tile as a decision state would have limited utility, since the relevant goal information (across all reachable goals) in this case would be 0 bits.
 Sricharan & Srivastava (2018) also follow a similar approach with slight modifications.
 As such, this work assumes ground truth rewards are not available, and furthermore we assume that expert demonstrations come from only a single domain (i.g, an instance of an environment where dynamics cannot be exactly replicated by the policy at training time).
Our contributions are threefold.
 Thus, we enable a standard meta-learning algorithm, which is designed for the task segmented setting, to be both trained and tested directly on time series data without the need for task segmentation.
 The main component of our framework is a network generator, each draw of which is a neural network that serves as the dynamic function for RL.
 Recent work in this area includes learning better transformations (DeVries & Taylor, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Zhong et al., 2017), inferring combinations of them (Cubuk et al., 2018), unsupervised methods (Xie et al., 2019), theory of data augmentation (Dao et al., 2018), and applications for one-shot learning (Asano et al., 2019).
 In contrast, the entropy term in the SAC objective forces the outputs to have sensible values, so that even with squashing, exploration is maintained.
 Then, we evaluate the impact of reducing the numbers of samples per class or the number of classes used for winning ticket generation.
 Thus we can writeg : Rdz → Rdx , z 7→ x = g(z), z ∼ P(z;θ).
 These representations are well-suited for frequency domain signals, as they have the ability to explicitly encode frequency magnitude and phase components.
 We show that applying standard pruning techniques, with and without distillation, can cause the generator’s behavior to no longer achieve the network’s goal.
 We show that the conditional masking strategy can successfully ease the missing-alignment between images and text, and obtain better joint embeddings for downstream tasks.
 However, deterministic gradient descent hard thresholding algorithms such as fast gradient descent hard thresholding (FG-HT) (Jain et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2014) have to compute the gradients of all n component functions, which leads to a huge computing overhead.
 But another view of curiosity is that of a minimax game where a curious agent is seeking to maximize the surprisal of an uncertainty model, while the uncertainty model seeks become less surprised about new states.
 In this work, we are interested in personalization methods that adapt the model for data available on each device, individually.
 In these cases, the training dynamics of some GANs can converge to the globally optimal solution.
Our contribution:
 The Gumble-Softmax is also introduced by GSGAN (Jang et al., 2017) and RelGAN (Nie et al., 2019) to solve this issue.
 a) Recognizing predicates is difficult since predicates are often abstract not as specific as objects.
To avoid this limitation, in our method we investigate in one shot models for point clouds which have no absolute orientation, i.g,, the point cloud structure is considered to be the same independent of its rotation, translation, and of the permutation of points.
 Other heuristic approaches exist in which distances between atoms are set to fixed idealized values (Havel, 2002; Blaney & Dixon, 2007).
We propose a model that handles unsupervised domain shift and missing data assuming nonstochastic missing data in the target domain.
 This can be achieved by, for example, integrating a “hallucinator” module into a meta-learning framework, where it generates hallucinated examples, guided by real examples (Wang et al., 2018).
 Fetaya et al., (2019) discuss the issues of likelihood as a metric for density modeling, which may be the reason of non-robust classification, e.g, OoD samples detection.
 Such DRL-based methods are especially attractive since they can even solve unexplored problems where domain knowledge is scarce and no efficient heuristic is known.
 The question is then: what kind of bias is reasonable?Our work.
 The CloudLSTM builds upon a Dynamic Point-cloud Convolution (DConv) operator, which takes raw point-cloud streams (both data time series and spatial coordinates) as input, and performs dynamic convolution over these, to learn spatiotemporal features over time, irrespective of the topology and permutations of the point-cloud.
 Mathematically, a goal-conditioned policy should minimize the conditional entropy over the states given a goal,H(S | G).
 Following the analogies between the CCIM and the Information Bottleneck (IB), the theoretical principle associated with the ELBO, we deduce that the representation quality is associated to the capacity term.
 We show that this tension between local and global fit stems from the estimator having the wrong inductive bias.
 For example, it has been reported that the inference speed when operating the same model on different devices differs according to the computing performance and memory capacity of the hardware accelerator (Ignatov et al., 2018).
 MLA-GAN is similar to the GANs with multiple generators (Khayatkhoei et al., 2018; Ghosh et al., 2017; Hoang et al., 2018), but the generators are restricted such that their inverse maps can be represented by a single deep encoder.
1We will use the term meta-evaluation to refer to either meta-validation or meta-testing, i.g,evaluation on the meta-learning validation set or test set, respectively.
 Normalizing flows are more expressive and enable the modelling of complex multi-modal priors.
 These findings are summarized below (c.f. Figure 1 for an illustration):1Our code and models for reproducing these results is available at github.
This paper investigates how imitation of diverse past trajectories leads a further exploration and helps avoid getting stuck at a sub-optimal behavior.
 Motivated by real-world applications, we propose DHN (Directed Hypergraph Network), a novel method for directed hypergraphs.
This is likely related to the growing evidence that DNNs may exploit highly discriminative features that do not match human perception (Jo & Bengio, 2017; Ilyas et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019).
Most current meta-RL methods leverage experience from previous tasks to adapt to new tasks by directly learn the policy parameters over primitive action space. (Finn et al., 2017; Rakelly et al., 2019).
 Contrary to previous works, in this paper we focus on model-based approaches and propose a novel framework for learning better partial models.
 When two tasks are competing or conflicting in the gradient update directions, especially with a large number of past tasks, these constraints have to be violated and the feasible solution might be null.
 1Thus somehow data augmentation has to be incorporated into the computation of the kernel itself.
 2) Even if the agent finds that the additional objectives can help solve the primary objective better, the direction of policy updates may not be biased toward this behavior.
This paper presents several new results for privacy-preserving learning that improve the state-ofthe-art in terms of both privacy and accuracy.
 Our experiments suggest meProp fails to converge on larger networks and datasets.
 To that end, we formulate the training problem by augmenting the regular task-specific loss (the cross-entropy classifier loss in our case) with the feature map entropy serving as a proxy to the memory rate.
Although GANs are versatile as mentioned above, most of their development focus on the metrics such as quality and diversity of the data Salimans et al., (2016); Heusel et al., (2017); Lucic et al., (2018).
 However, this can be computationally expensive, and can also end up training the policy on a state distribution that is far from the current policy’s induced distribution.
 Furthermore, SLW can be encoded with one remaining state which is not used to store TW in a 2 bits representation.
 We extend the scope of membership privacy to different distributions and show that the risk from membership attack increases further on DNNs as the test distribution is changed.
 Consequently, a) this memory would learn to store an optimized representation of the past geared towards prediction and b) it would require fewer storage locations as it does not need to naively store every observed context points.
 This alarming observation leads us to investigate the conditions that can allow consistency regularization to operate even in these conditions.
 DSGD can be implemented on distributed frameworks like parameter server and all-reduce framework.
The second type of the structure concerns the function of the inputs that is to be learnt, which we will call the learning task.
 The critical learning rate which separates the two regimes varies between architectures.
Recent work (Choi et al., 2019; Farsad et al., 2018), has thus looked at the problem of learning to jointly communicate.
 Still, state-ofthe-art systems struggle with solving some of the problems – see Section 6 for details.
 The procedure is probabilistically sound, exact, and does not require sampling.
However, Rosca et al., (2019) reports that in case of hybrid VAE-GANs, the latent space does not usually match the Gaussian prior.
 In a distinct line of research, recent works have tackled the challenge of efficiently optimizing a complex black-box function f : X → R, f(x) = y defined over high-dimensional, richly structured input domains X (e.g, graphs, images or text).
 In this case, although learning based approaches can be inexact, we can roughly estimate the range of the number of subgraph isomorphism.
 Although LASSO is scalable and widely used (Hans, 2009; Li et al., 2011; 2006), it is restricted to the domain of linear functions.
 The user retains flexibility in defining these anchors and we show strong performance across a suite of initialization strategies including random, frequency, and clustering-based methods.
 Compared with the very recent theoretical work for neural Q-learning (Yang et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2019a), our analysis relaxes the non-realistic i.i.d. data assumption and applies to neural network approximation with arbitrary number of layers.
 Bayesian neural networks learn a distribution over weights, and a good posterior approximation should be able to learn multi-modal posterior distributions in theory.
 However, such methods don’t incorporate exploration or learning into their procedures, and are especially prone to becoming trapped in poor local minima.
We revisit the concept of adding an autoencoder to model-free RL approaches, but with a focus on off-policy algorithms.
 A higher transfer of attack across networks is observed for data-free UAPs as well, raising its practical utility.
 We show that gradient descent almost perfectly interpolates the data over the information space (incurring only a small bias).
Our Contribution:
 For segmentation problems with a dense population of instances, such as the food components (see e.g, Figure 1), cells (Guerrero-Pena et al., 2018; Ronneberger et al., 2015), glandular tissue, or people in a crowd (Wang et al., 2018b), separating objects sharing a common boundary is a well known challenge.
 DeepXML reformulates this problem as an extreme multi-label learning task by treating each of the top 3 Million monetizable advertiser bid phrases as a separate label and learning a deep classifier to predict the relevant subset of bid phrases given an input query.
 In our setting, a sequence of tokens can be copied token-bytoken, in pairs of tokens, . , or in just a single step.
 When the batchsize is smaller, one does not need large learning rates to train efficiently, and so we can study the other benefits of batch normalization in isolation.
 Such methods proved to be quite successful.
Therefore, it is useful to address the following question: How do we translate the successes of masked language modeling and deep transformers to images? Unlike language which is a layer of abstraction to be able to understand the world and communicate thoughts, images are raw sensory observations.
 The right image of this figure shows the result of pixel-level OOD detection using one of the proposed methods, which clearly identifies the unusual objects.
 (1) Many forms of data, e.g, images, text, and other types of sequences, are often highly unstructured and complex.
 The first term, encourages the agent to choose its own goal states as diverse as possible, therefore improving the exploration, and the second term forces the agent to reach the different goals it has specified for itself, i.g,, training a goal-conditioned policy, (.|s, g).
Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in solving (1) for individual signals, both in terms of accuracy and inference speed (Mousavi et al., 2015).
 Their effectiveness hinges on whether or not they encompass the true structure of the data.
 Relying on Caron et al., (2018), we show that such unsupervised pre-training improves accuracy in many cases at little additional cost.
 We draw on the complementary strengths of the fine-grained evaluation and multidataset evaluation, driving fine-grained analysis to the multi-dataset setting.
 The sustainability prompts governments to re-recognize the role of the transport system, and thereby influences their transport policy (Manaugh et al., 2015).
 Building a VC system from non-parallel data is highly challenging, at the same time valuable for practical application scenarios.
 We propose two models, whereby f is trained jointly with either a “composition” function g (Model I) that answers questions about set union, or a “query” function h (Model II) that answers question about subsumption (see Figure 1(a)).
 However, these synthesis-based methods require the generative model to generate numerous diverse and highquality images for each class, including unseen ones, sufficient to classify with high-performance, which can be difficult and costly.
 These examples demonstrate substantial performance and area benefits from reducing FP precision by only 1 to 2-bits.
 As a result, we find that for a variety of popular deep learning models and datasets, bandwidth (and therefore training time) can be easily reduced by 2× on average relative to JPEG compression without affecting model accuracy.
Optimization approaches as described above can be thought of as instances of self-supervised learning, an informal name given to a machine learning paradigm with the goal of "predicting any part of the input from any other part" (LeCun, 2019).
 Example approaches include training with noisy data, introducing noise to network parameters during training, and using pixel level regularization (Milyaev & Laptev (2017); Nazaré et al., (2017); Luo & Yang (2014); Na et al., (2018); Long et al., (2019)).
 This position can be thought of as a multiset over a single element, and indeed the Transformer uses a position encoding involving sinusoidal functions that turns out to be a special case of our representation.
 As outlined by Achille & Soatto (2018); Censi & Murray (2011), the “optimal” learned function from input to output is maximally invariant to all data variations that do not contain information about the output.
 However, they are typically rather hard to train in practice (see e.g, (Rosenbaum et al., 2019) for the challenges of routing networks and references there in).
 While existing models can all explain (1), our model can also account for (2) and (3) naturally.
 In this regard, we present a technique that can handle all inputs and train an agent to manipulate natural painting media such as charcoal, pencil, watercolor, and so on.
 Past work investigating self-supervision for sequential data has focused on full-signal reconstruction (Dai & Le, 2015), and to a lesser extent forecasting (Ramachandran et al., 2016).
 The transformation is learnt by an adversarial strategy (Goodfellow et al., (2016)).
 Structural zeros are weights that are fixed at zero regardless of the model parameters.
Increasing the number of processing machines reduces the computational costs significantly.
 In each case, it was observed that the spectra of the kernels correlated strongly with whether or not the architectures were trainable.
 Other approaches have started looking at representations that are essentially probability distributions that are built from the co-occurrence of particular contexts.
 This result can be exploited to initialize recurrent architectures to approximate the linear autoencoder for the input sequences.
 We then apply randomization in that latent subspace, enabling us to create models that are robust to adversarial attacks, without modifying directly the weights, activations or inputs.
 Defferrard et al., (2016) and Fey et al., (2018) employ Graclus that successively coarsens a graph based on the heavy-edge matching heuristic.
 As illustrated in Figure 1, the attention in vanilla Transformer assigns high credits to many irrelevant words, while in Explicit Sparse Transformer, it concentrates on the most relevant k words.
 Both of these hypotheses motivate an understanding of how manifolds are acted upon by deep networks.
 Nowadays, any image uploaded to the Internet is likely to be analyzed by certain vision systems.
 Recent Deep Learning (DL) advances have motivated the development of general imputation methods relying on generative models such as GANs (Wang et al., 2018a; Xu et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019).
Inspired by multi-headed architectures already widely applied in various applications (Szegedy et al., 2015; Sercu et al., 2016; Osband et al., 2016; Song & Chai, 2018), we propose a multiheaded model to distill ensembles.
We propose a quality-diversity controllable GAN through a principle approach which is a generalization of N3DGAN (Li et al., 2019).
 This is achieved by plugging the value function into the planner, to provide guided heuristics in the local search, shorten the search horizon, and make the search computationally efficient.
 Right: Illustration of our SemanticAdv in the real world face verification platform.
 EI optimises a tractable objective function which only requires to evaluate the logarithm of the unnormalized target density.
 Subsequently, this allows our framework to perform, 1) unconditional generation and 2) conditional generation.
 We found that no single filter design can achieve optimal results on all possible graphs.
 We also evaluate our model on other regression tasks, namely the 1D heat equation tasks modeled by partial differential equations and the 2D Gaussian distribution tasks.
 Even though prior works investigate neural compression techniques like pruning or low-rank parameter factorization, they face fragility concerns regarding the tuning of hyperparameters and network architecture, besides struggling to balance the trade-off between compression and accuracy (Cheng et al., 2017).
 When meta-learning optimizes over a longer time horizon, or using a different algorithm, than the original “inner loop” learner, this can reveal new incentives for SIDS that were not apparent in the original learner’s behavior.
 Deep & Cross Network (DCN) (Wang et al., 2017) stacks multiple interaction layer to learn the high-order feature interaction.
 On the other hand, Burda et al., (2019b) proposed a self-frame prediction strategy by employing a predictor network to predict the feature representation of the current state from a fixed and randomly initialized target network.
 More importantly, it does not exploit the fine-grained semantics of each word in the sentence.
Machine learning (ML) was proposed to efficiently classify (stable) molecules and estimate chemical properties by reproducing the results of DFT, with recent advancements through a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) (Gilmer et al., 2017).
Importantly, this insight allows us to identify geometric relationships between such word embeddings necessary for other semantic relations to hold, such as those of knowledge graphs.
 The main idea is to mine ’harder’ training samples progressively on the data manifold according to the current parameter state of a network until a certain criteria is fulfilled(e.g, size of training dataset or performance on validation dataset).
 In this scenario, the constraint is not formulated as any specific distance between obstacles but the feeling according to experience.
 More recently, Wang et al., (2018) have shown that 8-bit floating representation can be used to train convolutional neural networks, with the help of specialized chunk-based accumulation and stochastic rounding hardware.
In deep learning in general, experimental evidence has established that higher order derivatives are usually "well behaved", in which case gradients of consecutive parameter updates correlate and applying momentum speeds up convergence (15; 16; 17).
 We attempt to identify the piecewise linear surfaces in input space where individual neurons transition from inactive to active.
 As a result of this rich collection of information, the student can develop complex associations between (a) the observed visual features, (b) the demonstrated arm movement, and (c) the provided verbal descriptions.
 Specifically, structures often exhibit as a sharing of zero/nonzero pattern for grouped entries (dependent on each other) of sparse signals.
 However, these methods cannot be directly applicable to joint learning the graph structure and graph representations when the graph is noisy or even not available.
 While this split strategy is not locally optimal in terms of information gain, the resulting decision trees have far more leaf nodes, and it endows more expressive power which can be helpful in dealing with noise and unseen data or classes.
 We perform verification of this property using the framework of abstract interpretation (Gehr et al., 2018).
 Thus, we estimate prediction by calculating the increments between two consecutive results, instead of calculating the separate prediction for each input data.
 The Hessian of the loss function has numerous almost-zero eigenvalues throughout training, thus the landscape is flat in many directions (Sagun et al., 2017; Papyan, 2018; Ghorbani et al., 2019).
 In this case, an intermediate representation with the smallest difference does not equal to an accurate prediction.
 However in sparse-data setting, topics (e.g, Z4) are incoherent (noisy) and therefore, it is difficult to infer meaningful semantics.
Instead, the most commonly used regularization in the RL community, is an “entropy regularization” term that penalizes the high-certainty output from the policy network, to encourage more exploration during the training process and prevent the agent from overfitting to certain actions.
In this work, we explore the combination of DCNNs and graph-based algorithms for annotating ground truth segmentation.
 GR-based approaches can address a continual learning setting where a stream of real samples is seen only once, which can not be considered in ER-based CL algorithms.
 For such purpose, aside from using the latent variable on which we condition primitive skills, an extra latent variable is introduced on which we condition our transitional policy.
 In particular, a problem-solving algorithm should be able to determine correctness without knowledge of English or consulting an answer key.
 The major difference between flow field inpainting and image inpainting lies in the fact that flow field data inherently follows the solution of the NavierStokes equations, and hence existing image inpainting algorithms can easily fail in physics-aware completion tasks as they never aim to capture the physical laws.
 This conclusion challenges the common practice of deterministic bias initialization for neural networks.
In this work, we investigate irregular weight pruning techniques on the BERT model, including the iterative pruning method (Han et al., 2015) and one-shot pruning method (Liu et al., 2019b).
In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model that can learn, without supervision, objectoriented 3D representation of a 3D scene from its partial 2D observations.
 Information collected from Google Maps.
 These updates are inspired from the 2D convolutional model, where such “updates” are an inherent consequence of the architecture.
Gradient penalties need to choose a metric on sample space: The above observation has motivated restriction of the size of the gradients of D (as a function on sample space) (Arjovsky & Bottou, 2017; Arjovsky et al., 2017; Gulrajani et al., 2017; Roth et al., 2017; Kodali et al., 2017;Miyato et al., 2018).
 However, how to open the internal mechanism of DNNs and investigate the across-layer behavior of a DNN remains an open question.
 To stabilize each trajectory and reduce error accumulation over long-time horizons, we use a state-invariant recurrent training mechanism.
 For example, in a web graph such as Wikipedia, a hyperlink between two webpages does not necessarily indicate that they belong to the same category, so mixing their features could be harmful for learning.
 Furthermore, the choice of reference value inherently introduces bias.
 We keep the advantages of GANs: unsupervised training, applicability on real datasets without feature engineering, the theoretical guarantees and simplicity.
 Kirkpatrick et al., (2016) preserved weights which correlate with previously acquired knowledge by using a fisher information matrix based regularizer.
 Crucially, we assume that the weight of each link of the neural network is a fixed sparse linear function of the genes.
We aim to learn a function from contextualized word representations to a space that exposes these similarities.
 Xu (2018) provided Fourier analysis to twolayer networks and showed similar empirical results on one-dimensional functions and real data.
 The control-variate techniques are shown to improve the convergence rate of SGD from a sub-linear to a linear convergence rate.
 We show that − log p(x | z) corresponds to the distortion and KL  q(z |x) || p(z) corresponds to the rate of the model.
 Building on the concept of Hessian eigenmaps introduced by Donoho & Grimes (2003), we evaluate this deviation from a locally linear mapping using the tangent Hessian, assuming the data points x ∈ RD lie on a low-dimensional manifoldM with dimension d D.
 In (Bellemare et al., 2016; Ostrovski et al., 2017), pseudo-counts are estimated from a density model.
 Hence, the primary challenge is to develop a generalizable unsupervised learning method which can extract an action’s characteristics from a dataset constituting its diverse effects.
 If the cost of repeating material syntheses is small relative to the cost of the search, the large aleatoric noise will present opportunities to synthesise materials possessing efficiencies far above their mean values.
 3.The third step of our approach looks at producing a robust boosting method that is trained over the generated noisy data.
 In other words, the learned low-dimensional latent state must retain a sufficient amount of information from the original state to accurately predict the state in the high-dimensional space.
 Compared with the state-of-the-art adversarial text generation methods, our approach achieves significantly higher untargeted and targeted attack success rate.
In summary, this work makes the following contributions:
 An illustration can be seen in Figure 1.
In order to manipulate real images for GAN models, we usually need to formulate an encoder via the framework of VAE.
 And the data-specific task dependency is learned with the position-wise mutual attention mechanism.
 Our work seeks to explore an interesting proposition: in addition to adapting from the labeled source, can we also perform uDA with other target domains, which themselves may have undergone domain adaptation in the past.
 There are two types of discrete perturbations that we consider, based on part-of-speech and named entities, with the aim of obtaining grammatical and semantically consistent alternative questions that do not accidentally have the same correct answer.
 We describe the relevant background and our methods in Section 2.
 To resolve this discrepancy, we aim to improve the predictive power of existing models on zero-shot codes by finetuning the models with synthetic latent features.
 For numerous application domains, as mentionned above, this assumption cannot be fulfilled.
3. Are MAML-type algorithms hindered by having a fixed update policy for training and testing tasks that is not conditioned on the available labeled examples for a new task?
 Surprisingly, recent works have demonstrated that up to certain minibatch sizes, linear scaling of the learning rate with minibatch size can be used to further speed up the github.pytraining Goyal et al., (2017).
 This allows DNNs to gradually focus on learning from undoubtedly correct samples even with an extreme level of noise in the labels (e.g, 80% noise ratio) and leads to improved performance as the supervision become less noisy.
 However, existing approaches usually only employ evaluation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE-L as rewards for RL training.
 In this paper we study the benefits of shared representations among tasks.
 These findings suggest that REINFORCE (§5) and CMRT (§6) are likely to improve over the pre-trained model only under the best possible conditions, i.g,, where the pre-trained model is “nearly” correct.
 Intuitively, two nodes with similar features should have a higher probability of being assigned to the same cluster.
 H(l) and W(l) are the features and weights at layer l, respectively.
 However, they do not put great efforts on how to learn to infer from one node to another node on a topological graph, especially in the few-shot regime.
 Our approach is intended to do both (1) and (2) without adversarial training, by using constant rewards instead of learned rewards.
 As a result, the NODE architecture is fully differentiable and could be incorporated in any computational graph of existing DL packages, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
 The networks gradually capture target-domain data distributions and thus refine pseudo labels for better feature learning.
 Furthermore, even if the representation transfers well, one still has the problem of identifying the new classes in an unlabelled dataset, which is a clustering problem.
 Double DQN (Hado van Hasselt et al., 2016), the extension of this idea to Q-learning with neural networks, has been shown to significantly improve performance over Q-learning.
 Related work from computer vision includes Teerapittayanon et al., (2016); Figurnov et al., (2017) and Wang et al., (2018) who explored the idea of dynamic routing either by exiting early or by skipping layers.
 To achieve even sparser neural networks, we argue to move beyond `0 and `1 regularizers and seek for a sparsity-inducing regularizer that is both almost everywhere differentiable (like `1) and scale-invariant (like `0).
 Note that this does not necessarily mean that these algorithms perform poorly, but rather that the search space has been sufficiently constrained so that even a random architecture in this space provides good results.
 The DPP defines the probability of choosing a random subset from the set of trajectory samples.
 One nominant example is the Tikhonov regularization r(x) = µ‖x‖22 for some predefined constant µ, and it can be used to alleviate the ill-conditioning and ensure that the magnitude of the weights will not become exceedingly large.
 If we train an LM on a stream of tasks, catastrophic forgetting still occurs.
 However, these works focus more on static decisions (each agent only makes a single decision).
 However, node degree is fairly limited; there can be different graph topologies with the same degree distribution.
 Our motivation is that a test sample’s location in the representation space and its distance to training samples should contain important information about the model’s decision-making process, which is useful for guiding confidence estimation.
 In learning of DPP, the term det(L) is typically treated as a singleton diversity measurement and is extended to learning paradigms on continuous space (Chao et al., 2015; Kulesza & Taskar, 2010; Affandi et al., 2014).
 In knowledge bases, the underlying relational structures across text entities are automatically constructed and applied to a new query to improve the searching efficiency.
 However, NVIL also comes with two disadvantages: (1) it leaves the inference problem of MRFs unsolved1 and only trains simple MRFs with tractable posteriors, and (2) the upper bound of the partition function can be underestimated (Kuleshov & Ermon, 2017), resulting in sub-optimal solutions on high-dimensional data.
Though there is a lot of prior work that investigates low-precision quantization, they mainly target on reducing the memory overhead caused by floating or high precision data representation in the networks, but not focus on specialized integer hardware for network inference.
 In this task, each pathology image of a lymph node section is a bag and each pixel inside that image is an instance.
Another important but relatively less explored problem is the problem of task order sensitivity, which describes the performance discrepancy with respect to the task arrival sequence (See Figure 1 (c)).
 Here, we aim at automating the architecture adaptation process so that each neuron of the network can either be kept intact, i.g,acting as global, or adapted to the new task locally.
 Adversarial examples are then generated on the whitebox model and transferred to the blackbox model.
 Another related line of research is hyper-heuristics, which is “a search method or learning mechanism for selecting or generating heuristics to solve computational search problems” (Burke et al., 2013).
 Recent works (Wang et al., 2019; Elthakeb et al., 2018) automatically select a QBN for each layer of a CNN through a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent without human intervention.
 In particular, we find a connection pattern of the popular NAS architectures.
 However, they only use∗J. Zhu and T. Chen are corresponding authors. J. Zhu is also with RealAI.a deep recurrent neural network to capture the historical information and fail to utilize the Markov property of the state in POMDPs. Igl et al., (2018) apply sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) (Le et al., 2017) to introduce inductive bias to the neural network, which can embody the Markov properties of the state.
 As long as the relative action values preserve the same rank of actions as the optimal action values (Q-values), we choose the same optimal action.
 To study this factor, we fix a single underlying MDP’s dynamics and generate a distribution of MDP’s by only modifying the observational outputs.
The exact mechanism of the deterioration in performance on clean images is unclear.
 Previous works have tried either pre-defined (Cai et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2016) or trainable (Choi et al., 2018b) clipping thresholds, but how to find the optimal threshold during training automatically is still not resolved.
Contributions: In this paper, we explore another approach to address the problem.
As a toy example, we show how to revise a pre-trained DNN to generate different features but represent consistent knowledge.
 It is a neural rendering approach that combines image-based rendering and the advances in deep learning.
 Inspired by literatures in robust optimization (Wald, 1939; Ben-Tal et al., 2009), Feige et al., (2015); Madry et al., (2018) formalize the notion of achieving adversarial robustness (i.g,, having small adversarial risk) as solving the following minimax optimization problemmin θ∈Rd LEadv(θ) = min θ∈RdE(x,y)∼D max δ∈∆`(θ, x+ δ, y)  , (1)where ∆ is the set that each sample could be contaminated by arbitrary perturbation chosen within this set.
 With some examples in Figure 1, we can clearly observe that unlike the previous verification related problems, TABFACT combines two different forms of reasoning in the statements, (i) Linguistic Reasoning: the verification requires semantic-level understanding.
 This dodges the many issues caused by estimating second derivatives with backpropagation on stochastic policies (see Section 2 for details).
 The program memory co-exists with the data memory in the MANN, providing more flexibility, reuseability and modularity in learning complicated tasks.
 The goal image provides nearly no useful cost signal until the last stage of the task, and model predictions are likely to become inaccurate beyond the first stage of the task.
Recent works studied decentralized NMARL under assumptions of global observations and local rewards (Zhang et al., 2018; Qu et al., 2019), which are reasonable in multi-agent gaming but not suitable in NSC.
 We make the following contributions:
 To summarize, our contributions in this work are as follows:
 Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide such structured computation and also inherit powerful data-fitting capacity from deep neural networks (Scarselli et al., 2009; Battaglia et al., 2018).
 However, AT methods are usually computationally expensive, and will often degenerate model performance on the clean inputs or under general-purpose transformations like rotation (Engstrom et al., 2019).
We believe that there are at least two major reasons for the current unsatisfying state of disentanglement learning: i) the lack of a formal notion of disentangled representations to support the design of proper objective functions (Tschannen et al., 2018; Locatello et al., 2019), and ii) the lack of robust evaluation metrics to enable a fair comparison between models, regardless of their architectures ordesign purposes.
 Given the difficulty of training robust classifiers in practice, they further postulate that the difficulty could stem from the insufficiency of training samples in the commonly used datasets, e.g, CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009).
 Additionally,Arora et al., (2019) explore the dynamics of such models, showing the singular values are learned at different rates and that deeper models exhibit stronger incremental learning dynamics.
 For example, in reinforcement learning, which is the primary subject of our experiments, the agent can be augmented with some privileged information in the form of a model based planner, or information which is the result of communication with another agent.
 In the extreme case, they might be virtually irreversible – say when the vase is broken.
 Specifically, we develop a Random Block Shuffle (RBS) transformation to study such relationship by breaking up the global structure features on normal adversarial examples.
 Also, since deep neural networks have become a popularmachine learning technique in applied domains, spurious correlations would undermine scientific discoveries.
Here, we want to accurately estimate the Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) for each instance i – i.g,, to estimate ei = y1i − y0i .
 Namely, the transport map pushes forward the given noise distribution to a generated distribution to approximate the real data distribution, the similarity between the two distributions determines the generalization ability of the generator Ben-David et al., (2010).
To represent a 3-way interaction we map each entity i to a triple (pi, l1i , l 2 i ) of vectors inH consisting of a query vector pi, a (first) key vector l1i and a (second) key vector l 2 i .
 Further, from the perspective of meta-RL algorithms that aim to learn efficient RL procedures (Duan et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Finn et al., 2017a), our approach also has significant appeal: as we aim to scale meta-RL towards broader task distributions and learn increasingly general RL procedures, exploration and efficiency becomes exceedingly difficult.
 Leveraging such attack technique, successful AEs on as few as one single frame is enough to move an existing object in to or out of the headway of an autonomous vehicle and thus may cause potential safety hazards.
 A challenging issue is to design a reliable criteria to select clean samples.
 Nakkiran (2019) showed that a model requires more capacity to be robust (i.g,, simple models can have high natural accuracy but are less likely to be robust).
 Second, an adversary attacker who intercepts the features in the middle should not be able to recover the exact input, nor can it figure out the correct output.
 As we prove rigorously in this paper, the slow-down of convergence caused by the small stepsize negates the benefit brought by the momentum term.
 As a consequence, the considered setup allows us to explicitly encode prior knowledge and biases into the learned representation via annotation, rather than relying solely on implicit biases such as the choice of network architecture with possibly hard-to-control effects.
 (2) 2. Positive scaling of all incoming weights of a unit coupled with inverse scaling of its out-going weights.
 This occurs for different likelihood-based generative models, and even when inputs are unrelated to training data or have totally different semantics.
 Usually, the data from different genres or times typically have different underlying distributions.
Surprise- or difficulty-based exploration may sometimes discover desired agent behaviors (Gregor et al., 2016b; Burda et al., 2018; Haber et al., 2018).
∗Equal contribution with authors in alphabetical order.
 The red area has higher reward.
In Section 5, we design a practical algorithm for learning the conservatively-extrapolated value function by a negative sampling technique inspired by work on learning embeddings Mikolov et al., (2013); Gutmann & Hyvärinen (2012).
 Today, the convergence of this ODE is known in two regimes: under linear function approximation for general environments (Tsitsiklis & Van Roy, 1997) and under reversible environments for general function approximation (Ollivier, 2018).
 The inability of a traditional meta-learner to zoom-in on important features is further illustrated in Figure 2: when considering the target class fifty (lifestyle for middle-aged), the standard prototypical network (Snell et al., 2017) attends to uninformative words like “date,” while downplaying highly predictive words such as “grandma.”
 For stochastic heavy ball momentum, a weighted average of stochastic gradients at the visited points is maintained.
 We find the adversarial policies reliably beat their victim, despite training for less than 3% of the timesteps initially used to train the victim policies.
 Specifically, we propose a new class of video prediction models that can provide exact likelihoods, generate diverse stochastic futures, and accurately synthesize realistic and high-quality video frames.
 This discourages deployment of GSTs when a deep architecture is needed.
 Thus, we propose a new weakly supervised knowledge learning objective that requires themodel to distinguish between true and false knowledge expressed in natural language.
 Another solution is to use a manual cache (e.g, lookup table) that overrules model predictions on problematic samples.
We combine these two sources of information by learning a representation of a program from both its static syntax and its dynamic intermediate state during execution.
 Inheriting and inspired by the successful practice in hand-crafted efficient segmentation, we propose a novel NAS framework dubbed FasterSeg, aiming to achieve extremely fast inference speed and competitive accuracy.
 Both functions are represented as parameterized neural networks.
 This allows us to leverage the inexact proximal point algorithmic framework proposed in (Rafique et al., 2018) to solve stochastic AUC maximization with a deep neural network.
 However, the certification methods are usually computationally expensive and can only handle shallow neural networks with ReLU activations, so these training algorithms have troubles in scaling to modern networks.
 Motivated by this, we propose using the reconstruction sub-network in a CapsNet as an attack-independent detection mechanism.
 The partition allows us to drop the adversarial constrain and employ a novel asymmetrical adversarial training (AAT) objective to train robust binary classifiers in subspaces.
 The belief state is an agent-estimated variable encoding underlying states of the environment that determines state-transitions and rewards.
 The chief periodically determines the best policy among all learners and distributes the best policy parameter to all learners so that the learners search for better policies with the guidance of the previous best policy.
 Theyproposed a cultural evolutionary account of the origins of compositionality and designed a framework called iterated learning to simulate the language evolution process, based on the idea that the simulated language must be learned by new speakers at each generation, while also being used for communication.
 The transferred adversarial example could be a good starting point that lies close to the decision boundary for the target network and accelerate further optimization.
 As a result, it is never guaranteed that image classifiers with highly competitive performance on such small and fixed test sets can generalize to real-world natural images with much richer content variations.
 In the main experiment, we finetune BERTLARGE with mixout(wpre) on small training sets of GLUE (Wang et al., 2018).
∗These two authors contributed equally.
 To reach good classification accuracies, these networks cascade several dictionary learning blocks.
 Coresets decrease massive inputs to smaller instances while maintaining a good provable approximation of the original set with respect to a given function.
For a training set and a set of weights at which all neurons are inactive, results we present in this work, tighten the existing bounds on the over-parameterization required to guarantee this property.
Our result significantly extends the existing study on the existence of spurious local minimum.
 However, in a heterogeneous cluster, it is common that some workers, also referred to as stragglers, run much slower than others.
 Later, Rashid et al., (2018) relaxed the linear assumption in VDN by assuming that the Q-values of individual agents and the global one are also monotonic, and proposed QMIX employing a network that estimates joint action-values as a complex non-linear combination of per-agent values.
 We consider random Gaussian noise because of its certified robustness guarantee (Cohen et al., 2019).
 However, adding a positive intrinsic bonus to the reward yields optimistic Q-values only for state-action pairs that have already been chosen sufficiently often.
 ∗Equal contribution.
is representative of this direction is Deformable Convolution (Dai et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2019).
A fundamental limitation of ensembles is that the computational cost of training and, more importantly, inference can be many times greater than that of a single model.
 Unfortunately, ASGD also has a significant weakness known as gradient staleness; the gradients used to update the parameter server’s (master) parameters are∗Equal contribution.
 In part due to these issues, some have considered non-architectural constraints.
 We propose an intuitive candidate for such a function and evaluate its quality, both in explaining the observed error landscapes and in extrapolating from small scale (seen) to large scale (unseen) errors.
 Others have supplemented gradient approaches with1At the time of this writing.
 Unfortunately, existing methods for extracting logical rules from general neural architectures lack sufficient precision (Augasta & Kathirvalavakumar, 2012), while inductive logic learning lacks sufficient expressiveness for use in verification (Evans & Grefenstette, 2018).
 Using a simple metric—the relative improvement over the average architecture of the search space—we find that most NAS methods perform very similarly and rarely substantially above this baseline.
 Prior works attempt to address such demand through the extensive use of resolution-preserving blocks (Wang et al., (2017; 2018); Kalchbrenner et al., (2016)).
In order learning, a set of classes, Θ = {θ1, θ2, · · · , θn}, is ordered, where each class θi represents one or more object instances.
 1Project page:， this example, readers need to identify the logical connections between the lines to pinpoint the conflict, then understand each of the options and select an option that solves the conflict.
 AssembleNet is a general formulation thatallows representing various forms of multi-stream CNNs as directed graphs, coupled with an efficient evolutionary algorithm to explore the network connectivity.
 To address this problem, we propose to augment the data with properties that enforce insensitivity of the representation with respect to families of transformations.
 Furthermore, due to its variational formulation, training a VAE requires approximating expectations through sampling at the cost of increased variance in gradients (Burda et al., 2015; Tucker et al., 2017), making initialization, validation, and annealing of hyperparameters essential in practice (Bowman et al., 2016; Higgins et al., 2017; Bauer & Mnih, 2019).
 As shown in Figure 1, we notice the allocation of computation across different resolutions has a great impact on the ERF.
In our work, we learn a generative model of the environment as an input to the agent.
Some of the most common reproducibility problems we encounter in this field concern hyperparameters selection and the correct usage of data splits for model selection versus model assessment.
 This additional restriction should be expected to aid generalization.
 The details can be found in Appendix G.
 Both components are updated sequentially, while adapting to changes in the data distribution.
 Given this metric space of graph spectral measures and the underlying distance as the Lp Wasserstein distance, we compute Wasserstein barycenters (Agueh & Carlier, 2011) for each set of graphs specific to a base class and term these barycenters as prototype graphs.
 The mismatch between training and testing distributions, also known as covariate shift (Ross & Bagnell, 2010; Ross et al., 2011), yields significant compounding errors.
 The attacker does not know the class labels, samples from any target class, the entire re-trained model, or probabilities the model assigns to each class, making it target-agnostic.
 The language model predicts the next word of a response based on the prior sub-sequence, and the context processor ensures coherence of the dialogue by attending over the conversation history.
 First, we induce the value states of nonterminals with hierarchical embeddings, which help the model become aware of the hierarchical and sibling relationships between the nodes.
Our theoretical results are consistent with a number of observations about the Hessian (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Pascanu et al., 2014; Dauphin et al., 2014; Chaudhari et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2017; Pennington & Bahri, 2017; Geiger et al., 2018), and sheds a new light on them.
However, most existing work on mean-field games focuses on characterizing the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium rather than designing provably efficient algorithms.
 As the training and∗This work was mostly done during internship at VMware Research.
 This is much more effective than MMD-nets, but training MMD-GANs can be challenging, because in this saddlepoint optimization problem, the need to balance training of the learned kernel and the generator can create a sensitivity to hyperparameter settings.
 More broadly, however, we envision that property signatures could be useful across a broad range of problems, including algorithm induction (Devlin et al., 2017), improving code readability (Allamanis et al., 2014), and program analysis (Heo et al., 2019).
 As shown in Figure 1, to model long-range dependency in a more efficient way, V4D is composed of two critical designs: (1) holistic sampling strategy, and (2) 4D convolutional interaction.
 Interestingly, the model learns complex frequency attenuation patterns as simple inclusion of high-frequency information turns out to be insufficient.
 We show that its root cause is: the adaptive learning rate has undesirably large variance in the early stage of model training, due to the limited amount of training samples being used.
 We can also formulate a semi-supervised skill learning method, where a user expresses preferences over goals, and the agent autonomously collects experience to learn dynamical distances in a self-supervised way.
 In contrast, if support data is expected to be abundant, then the meta-learner can provide generally more relaxed biases to the task-specific learner to achieve better fitting to the taskdata.
Our contributions are as follows:
 Empirical results demonstrate that our estimators have much better bias-variance trade-off compared to existing methods on standard benchmark tasks.
 Experimental investigations further show that specific brain areas (e.g, LO) appear specialised for objects, for example responding more strongly to common objects than to scenes or textures, while responding only weakly to movement (cf. MT) (e.g, GrillSpector & Malach, 2004).
Additionally, we address that temperature modulation changes the entropy of the conditional distributions, as opposed to changing the entropy of the joint distribution.
 These previously proposed methods usually require considerable modifications to the underlying framework.
 However, as the quantizer itself is discontinuous, such an approach requires approximating its gradient, which existing methods have done in a relatively coarse manner that ignore the impact of transitions between quantized states (Choi et al., 2018b;a; Jung et al., 2018).
 A similar effect occurs in the daisy example (row 2 of fig.  1), where a direction in latent space moves the daisy up and down, but cannot move it out of frame.
 Active learning methods can be roughly divided in two groups: (i) methods that combine different manually-designed AL strategies (Roy & McCallum, 2001; Osugi et al., 2005; Gal et al., 2017; Baram et al., 2004; Chu & Lin, 2016; Hsu & Lin, 2015; Ebert et al., 2012; Long & Hua, 2015) and (ii) data-driven AL approaches (Bachman et al., 2017; Fang et al., 2017; Konyushkova et al., 2017; Woodward & Finn, 2016; Ravi & Larochelle, 2018; Konyushkova et al., 2018), that learn which samples are most informative to train a model using information of the model itself.
 Therefore our goal is to recover the sign of the gradient with high query efficiency so we can use it to generate adversarial examples as effective as those generated by full gradient estimation approaches.
Research on deep semi-supervised learning has almost exclusively focused on classification as the downstream task (Kingma et al., 2014; Rasmus et al., 2015; Odena, 2016; Dai et al., 2017; Oliver et al., 2018).
 This allows us to abstract out the specific constraint without loss of generality since any one of the aforementioned constraints could be converted to a finite iteration limit.
 Furthermore, as suggested by Glorot et al., (2011), sparsity can have additional advantages of linear separability and information disentanglement.
 However, the analysis of batch TD does not take into account the statistical nature of the training samples, which are generated by a MDP.
 Several papers attempt to relax this on-policy requirement and resolve the sample inefficiency problem by designing off-policy imitation learning algorithms, which may take advantage of past logged data, usually in the form of a replay buffer (Kostrikov et al., 2019; Sasaki et al., 2019).
 The first issue means that greedy or beam search decoding, which rely on the top of the list to generate, are not optimized – there is a discrepancy between maximizing the log-probability of a ground-truth token and ensuring the rank of the ground-truth token to be one.
 In particular we are able to achieve reliable control over affect, speaking rate and F0 variation (F0 is the
 Specifically, whereas exact Bayesian or Frequentist uncertainty includes underdetermination as one component, approximate methods such as Laplace approximations (MacKay, 1992) or influence function-based methods (Schulam & Saria, 2019) break down when underdetermination is present.
 However, publicly available pre-trained models may carry an unknown but significant risk of tampering by an adversary.
 Furthermore, Carlini et al., (2018) showed that deepneural networks can effectively memorize user-unique training examples, which can be recovered even after only a single epoch of training.
 In contrast, real-life learning experiences are heterogeneous: they vary in terms of the number of classes and examples per class, and are unbalanced.
∗work performed when interning at Google.
 In order to succeed, the rewards cannot lead the model astray towards observations significantly different than those with which the model was trained.
 Here, we show that this is not necessary.
 Therefore, the authors of (Cheng et al., 2019) are able to use standard zeroth order optimization to solve the new formulation.
 As such, this work sets out to present an Adaptive approach dubbed CHAMELEON to significantly reduce the compilation time and offer automation while avoiding dependence to hand-optimization, enabling far more diverse tensor operations in the next generation DNNs.
 Another possibility is that contextual illusions are the by-product of efficient neural routines for scene segmentation (Keemink & van Rossum, 2016; Mély et al., 2018).
 In this setting, the model is not allowed to be pretrained on another dataset, such as Imagenet, and is evaluated on its ability to perform classification using auxiliary attributes and labels trained only using the data available from the training split of the target dataset.
 Specifically, our contributions are as follows:
Through extensive experiments on several financial and image datasets and in-depth analysis, we summarize our main contributions and findings as follows.
 Typically, as problem dimension d increases, these ZO algorithms suffer from increasing iteration complexity by a small polynomial of d to explore the higher dimensional query space.
 The desired agents operate from high dimensional inputs (pixels) and, consequentially, use deep networks (ResNet50) that strain the parameter server.
 Given a test input x ∈ X , a confidence set CT (x) ⊆ Y1Our code is available at github.(parameterized by T ∈ R) should contain the true label y for at least a 1− fraction of cases: P(x,y)∼Dy ∈ CT (x) ≥ 1− .
 More concretely, PG first executes a DNN layer in a low precision and identifies the output features with large magnitude as important features.
 Empirically, we find that our approach enables a dramatic reduction (two orders of magnitude) in the size of the mapping network compared to the decoder networks employed by other methods.
 While VHE-StackGAN++ already achieves very attractive performance, we find that its performance can be clearly boosted by better exploiting the multi-stochastic-layer semantically meaningful hierarchical latent structure of the PGBN text decoder.

 Because of weight sharing across nearby filters that overlap each other, the parameter space of convolution layer with FS is much smaller than its counterpart in conventional CNNs.

 This phenomenon is illustrated by Figure 1.

 Also, more powerful attention mechanisms (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dehghani et al., 2018) or the use of context (Seo et al., 2016) have recently allowed traditional neural networks to tackle the same set of tasks.

 This type of methods can restore the performance in small batch cases to some extent.
 A natural question to ask is: How much communication is actually needed for near-optimal performance? In this work, we show that the answer is somewhat surprising: The required communication cost has almost no dependence on the time horizon.
 Sleep has been identified as being critical for memory consolidation - a process of converting recent memories into long-tern storage (Rasch & Born (2013)).
 Motivated by this intriguing finding, Bartlett et al., (2019) studied the convergence rate of GD for training deep linear networks with identity initialization, which is equivalent to zero initialization in deep linear ResNets.
 The result of ward clustering is a tree where leaf nodes represent voxels of the brain and interior nodes represent grouping of voxels into spatial clusters.
 Most of the work is done during Junxian’s internship at FAIR.
 For example, a common approach in recommender systems, collaborative filtering (He et al., 2017), predicts the item interests of each user with the help of the collection of item preferences for a large number of users.
 In addition to expressing logical constraints (e.g, subtyping relations) as in traditional type inference, a type dependency graph also incorporates contextual hints involving naming and variable usage.
 For example, the condition in a cGANs framework is typically provided as embedded conditional vectors through the embedding look-up table for one-hot encoded labels (Brock et al., 2019; Miyato & Koyama, 2018).
 The model projects its inferred 3D feature maps to novel viewpoints, and matches them against visual representations extracted from the target view.
 For classification, upon the learned representations, the model recognizes the long-tailed classes through various classifiers.
 If, for some reason, the arm needs to be replaced and the specifications do not exactly match, then the control policy still needs to be able to perform the task with the ‘perturbed’ robotic arm dynamics.
 Variational inference can approximate posterior distributions using Monte Carlo sampling for gradient estimation.
 This suggests that minimizing the empirical risk with the 0-1 loss function is equivalent to minimize the empirical adversarial risk (worst-case risk).
 These examples could be representative of all or a subset of the non-inspectable data, while at the same time preserving the privacy of individuals.
 Memory-wise, each ensemble member requires an independent copy of neural network weights, each up to millions (sometimes billions) of parameters.
 Variants of TP differ in how exactly the target activity is projected backward (LeCun, 1986; Bengio, 2014; Bartunov et al., 2018).
 Furthermore, they are only applicable when the specific physics equations are explicitly given and still hard to be generalized to incorporate other types of equations.

 For example, observational healthcare data typically contain patient records, whose treatments were provided by different doctors in multiple hospitals, each following potentially different procedures that are not always possible to specify explicitly.
 We summarize our main contributions as follows.
 This method adds a regularizer λ }θ ´ θp0q}2 to the training objective.
 This way of characterizing images is also described in Krishna et al., (2016).
kinetic and potential energy of a physical system can be leveraged to synthesize appropriate control strategies, such as the method of controlled Lagrangian (Bloch et al., 2001) and interconnection & damping assignment (Ortega et al., 2002), which can reshape the closed-loop energy landscape to achieve a broad range of control objectives (regulation, tracking, etc.).
 The key idea there is to utilize the properties of higher order SOS polynomials to correctly recover one column of the dictionary at a time, for which there are m columns in total.
One way to address this challenge is to consider the self-supervised paradigm.
 Our theory starts from the fact that a two-layer neural network fW0+W(x) (with smooth activation) can be Taylor expanded with respect to the weight matrix W asfW0+W(x) = m∑ r=1 arσ((w0,r + wr) >x) = m∑ r=1arσ(w > 0,rx)︸ ︷︷ ︸fW0 (x)+ ∞∑ k=1 m∑ r=1 ar σ(k)(w>0,rx) k! (w>r x) k︸ ︷︷ ︸ f (k) W0,W (x).

 Specifically, on zero-shot XNLI, where the model is trained on English MultiNLI and tested on other languages (Conneau et al., 2018b), the aligned model improves accuracies by 2.78% on average over the base model, and it remarkably matches translate-train models for Bulgarian and Greek, which approximate the fully-supervised setting.
 The whole process is then repeated.
 For a triplet of an anchor, a positive, and a negative sample, the loss function is designed to pull the anchor and the positive closer and to push the anchor and the negative apart.

 PM led efforts to migrate to the new pytorch transformer, helped with code release.
 Though some research tackles this problem, their performance is limited when applied to natural images.
 Instead of better, yet still imperfect search heuristics, we describe how interval bound propagation (IBP) (Gowal et al., 2018; Mirman et al., 2018) – a formal model verification method – can be used to efficiently cover the full reduction space, and verify the under-sensitivity specification.
 More specifically, in generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014), a generator network learns to generate natural-looking images with a training objective to fool a discriminator network.
 Although this approach is basic and has been considered before (Vinyals et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018), it has gone unnoticed that it outperforms many sophisticated few-shot algorithms.
Contributions Our contributions are summarized as follows:
To overcome this problem, we would like an objective that captures correlations and higher order output dependencies.
 It would have benefited from improved efficiency and better simplification if there were algorithms independent of human knowledge.
 Due to reusing the computation in policy evaluation and dispensing with the retraining of the target network, the computing cost and time overhead are extremely reduced.
 During this meta-training step, we observe both the training and test data.
Demographic parity condition requires that the model output (e.g, assigned label) be independent of sensitive attributes.
 If the cost is correctly specified, then there are powerful methods for finding the global optimal transport (Villani, 2008).

 In contrast, empirically motivated complexity measures such as sharpness (Keskar et al., 2016) are justified by experimentation and observation.
 For frames under perturbation in the input sequence, we aim to compute a lower bound such that when these frames are perturbed within `p-balls centered at the original frames respectively and with a radius of , the model prediction is certified to be unchanged.
 Furthermore, the communication patterns of both algorithms are identical if B HBloc.
 (3)While adversarial adversarial optimization techniques such as GANs can in principle solve problem eq. (3), they remain under-constrained thus not giving a reasonable solution to the original problem eq.(1).
 By adding a correction term to the follower, we explicitly cancel out negative effects of the leader update.
In this work, our goal is to propose a novel expansion-based approach for task-free CL.
 A unified theory is required if we wish to eliminate these artificial boundaries, and better cross-pollinate, node embeddings and structural representations in novel techniques.
 It would be fatal in some safety-critical applications such as a medical domain: a patient’s probability of developing disease for example should not be evaluated differently depending on the number of medical tests they received (we do not want our model to predict the probability of death is high just because some patient has been screened a lot!).
 To illustrate its influence, we have conducted an example experiment with 8-layer GCN in Figure 1, in which the training of such a deep GCN is observed to converge poorly.
 These attention maps are embedded into the generator and discriminator to focus on semantically important areas, thus facilitating the shape transformation.
 In addition, conditional computation with channel gating can potentially increase the interpretability of models.
Our contributions are three-fold:
 To enable differentiable sampling from this distribution, we leverage recent advancements in a continuous relaxation of this sampling process, known as Gumbel-softmax sampling or sampling from a concrete distribution (Jang et al., 2017; Maddison et al., 2016).
 Therefore, differential privacy can potentially be leveraged to improve theidentification of outliers.
Previous works on learning to optimize model parallelism decisions (Mirhoseini et al., 2017; 2018; Addanki et al., 2019) have not considered generalization to a broad set of graphs nor joint optimization of placement and scheduling.
 Examples of various successful ensembling methods include averaging, bagging (Breiman (1996)), boosting (Dietterich (2000)), etc.
G-CNNs are well motivated from both a mathematical point of view (Cohen et al., 2018a; Kondor & Trivedi, 2018) and neuro-psychological/neuro-mathematical point of view and their improvement over classical CNNs is convincingly demonstrated by the growing body of G-CNN literature (see Sec.2).
We validate our findings on a variety of competitive benchmarks, namely WMT14 EnglishGerman for machine translation, WikiText-103 (Merity et al., 2016) for language modeling, CNNDailymail (Hermann et al., 2015) for abstractive summarization, ELI5 (Fan et al., 2017) for long form question answering, and several natural language understanding tasks (Wang et al., 2019a) for sentence representation.
 This could be lexical similarity (shared words or wordparts) or structural similarities (word-ordering or word-frequency), or both.
 Such features are grounded on the semantics of physics and should be useful in many ways (e.g, sample efficiency, interpretability, geometric reasoning and inference, transferability).

 For this setting we show that communication efficient CHOCO-SGD can improve time-to-accuracy on large tasks, such as e.g, ImageNet training.
Besides, although it may not be surprising that adversarial attacks exist for the deep RL agents as adversarial attacks have been shown to be possible for neural network models in various supervised learning tasks.
 Unfortunately, universality results do not reveal how a machine solves a task, only that it has the capacity to do so.
 We would like to discover curiosity mechanisms that can generalize across a much broader distribution of environments, even those with different state and action spaces: from image-based games, to joint-based robotic control tasks.
 When the initial conditions are fixed it is possible to be extremely efficient through tracking (Aytar et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2018); however, with a large variety of initial conditions the agent is forced to generalize over environment configurations not present in demonstrations.
 We take a totally different path that meta-learn the “gradient” descent on xt without using yt.
 However, class-conditional likelihood necessarily needs to decrease towards the decision-boundary for the classifier to work well.
 Fully unsupervised disentanglement is highly ambitious and is work in progress, current methods typically do not produce consistently good results in this setting (Locatello et al., 2019).
1 It has the advantage of a better reduction in dimensionality, while maintaining efficient optimization.
 Initially the learned reward model, f ′(x), is unreliable, so we rely entirely on f(x) to assess sequences and update the policy.
 Another line of work removes the need for gradient estimation and uses decision-based techniques (Brendel et al., 2017) or genetic algorithms1Our code is available at github.
 Each subtask can provide the agent with reward; if only few subtasks provide reward, this is considered a sparse reward problem.
 The first metric measures the total amount of reconstruction errors in input and hidden spaces.
The key motivation of this work originates from physical computing that tackles its various framedependent and temporally-evolved computational challenges by creating the most natural and effective geometric toolsets under the two different viewpoints.
 Specifically, in addition to the existing masking strategy, StructBERT extends BERT by leveraging the structural information: word-level ordering and sentence-level ordering.
 This is in line with recent works which have shown that re-scaling the binary convolution output can result in large performance gains (Rastegari et al., 2016; Bulat & Tzimiropoulos, 2019).
Moreover, the IB objective belongs to a general form of two-term trade-offs in many machine learning objectives: L = Prediction-loss + β · Complexity, where the complexity term generally takes the form of regularization.
 We argue that search space of finer granularity is critical to find optimal neural architectures.
Despite playing a pivotal role across a variety of domains, MI is notoriously intractable.
 We then present a novel Long-Short Range Attention (LSRA) primitive.
 Savarese et al., considered two-layer (i.g,, single hidden layer) ReLU networks, with an unbounded (essentially infinite) number of units, and where the overall Euclidean norm (sum of squares of all the weights) is controlled.
 In general, enforcing Lipschitz continuity of complex models can be useful for a lot of applications.
 In contrast to humans’ such ability, state-of-the-art continual learning approaches do not achieve the expected generalization.
 Therefore, it is very important that the imitator should be able to resume to the demonstration trajectory by itself.
 In fact, many globally different shapes share similar part-level structures.
 However, these examples are easily distinguishable by human and are also not scalable to complex datasets.
 However, most of these gradient based regularization methods either provide marginal gains or fail to introduce any improvement when normalization is used (Kurach et al., 2019), which is also observed in our experiments.
 As detailed in Theorem 2.1, the error between the infinite width and sampled networks is Õ( + 1/√m).
 As such, the state-of-the-art remains at the level of modeling videos containing only a few objects, such as MNIST digits, per image.
 Such strategies benefit from preserving the accuracy metric of the defender.
 What gives it the necessary flexibility are trainable gates that are tuned to modulate and combine the outputs of these branches, as shown in fig. 1.
 We present a loss based on the Bingham distribution (Bingham, 1974), an antipodally symmetric distribution on the sphere.
 Several studies in neuroscience and psychology have shown that our visual system does not react equally to all transformations we encounter in visual data.
Recently, and in parallel to our work, (Jain et al., 2019) explored the use of STE to define the gradient with respect to the quantizers’s dynamic range.
 We prove that such procedure1reduces the gradient noise of the algorithm, and in fact minimizes the gradient variance in the limit where the auxiliary model optimally mimics the data distribution.
 In practice, MC dropout can give arbitrarily overconfident estimates (Foong et al., 2019).
 One classical approach to proving generalization bound is via notions of complexity.
The emerging Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) model that offers DL computation tools in the cloud makes remote hardware side-channel attacks a practical vector for stealing DL systems (Liu et al., 2015).
 To reduce the latency, spike-based backpropagation rules have been proposed that perform end-to-end gradient descent training on spike data.
We thus propose monotonic multihead attention (MMA), which combines the high translation quality from multilayer multihead attention and low latency from monotonic attention.
 Finally, the structure of the gradient features and the linear model allows us to derive an efficient and scalable algorithm for training and inference.
 †Work partially done during an internship at Baidu Research.
 This work is (jointly or partly) funded by the NSFC (Grant No. 61876095) and Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI).networks (DNNs) have been proven both effective and efficient in dealing with many tasks, including image classification (He et al., 2016), object detection (Girshick, 2015), speech recognition (Hinton et al., 2012), and also sparse coding (Gregor & LeCun, 2010; Wang et al., 2016; Borgerding et al., 2017; He et al., 2017; Zhang & Ghanem, 2018; Chen et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Sulam et al., 2019).
 We consider a specific dynamics that includes a transition defining a Markov process and the forward propagation of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) (Kipf & Welling, 2017), which is one of the most popular graph NN variants, as special cases.
 In real-world applications, partially labeled datasets are common, making tools that are able to efficiently utilize the present labels particularly useful.
 We first conduct a toy experiment with the BIM attack and ResNet-18 on the ImageNet validation dataset (Deng et al., 2009) to investigate how skip connections affect the adversarial strength of attacks crafted on the network.
 During the training and decoding process, a group of images with a similar topic to the source sentence will be retrieved from the topic-image lookup table learned by the term frequency-inverse document frequency, and thus is encoded as image representations by a pretrained ResNet (He et al., 2016).
 However, unsupervised domain adaptation approaches assume that numerous unlabeled images are available in the target domain during training.
 The standard deep neural network architectures are uniformly plastic; hence, all neurons are prone to changes during training, and this powerful capability is also the demise of these networks and leads to catastrophic forgetting.
 Furthermore, under some conditions, it is also known that demographic parity can lead to accuracy parity (Zhao & Gordon, 2019).
 The ones of chief interest are turnover-based, class-based, and Duration-of-Stay (DoS) based strategies.
 Moreover, there are AC-GNNs that can reproduce the WL labeling, and hence AC-GNNs can be as powerful as the WL test for distinguishing nodes.
complementary aspects of optimization (Roux et al., 2008; Ghorbani et al., 2019) and generalization performance of DNNs (Jiang et al., 2020; Keskar et al., 2017; Bjorck et al., 2018; Fort et al., 2019).
 The anatomical and functional properties of these feedback connections have been well-documented (see Gilbert & Li 2013 for a review), but the relative contributions of horizontal vs. top-down connections for perceptual grouping remains an open question.
 The goal of this paper is to show that both kinds of correlation or redundancy hamper effective learning.
 For example, Shen et al., (2017) and Yang et al., (2018) design adversarial discriminators to shape their unsupervised objective – an approach that can be effective, but often introduces training instability.
 †Work performed while at OpenAItime consuming and costly.
 However, some NAS algorithms can not be applied directly on NASBench-101, and NAS-HPO-Bench only has 144 candidate architectures, which maybe insufficient to evaluate NAS algorithms.
Present work.
 It is naturally easy to select the knowledge in the pool once the response is known, because the response is generated based on theselected knowledge.
 Examples include hyperparameter optimization which is repeatedly done for the same machine learning model on varying datasets or the optimization of control parameters for a given system with varying physical configurations.
 To have exponential dimensionality of the state space, though, the qubits in the register have to be interconnected so that their states can become entangled; a set of all possible states of n completely separated, independent qubits can be fully represented by C2n instead of C2n .
 We explain further with two illustrative applications.
 Both distances and angles are invariant to translation, rotation, and inversion of the molecule, as required.
 As a result, Arora et al., (2018) reported that a simple VC-dimension bound (Li et al., 2018; Harvey et al., 2017) can still give sharper evaluations than these norm based bounds in some practically used deep networks.
The generalization deterioration can be seen in fig. 1.
We introduce a variant of the RealNVP (Dinh et al., 2016) invertible neural network: the General Incompressible-flow Network (GIN).
Currently, no class of structured linear maps satisfies all of these criteria.
This paper closes this gap by demonstrating the Early-Bird (EB) tickets phenomenon: the winning tickets can be drawn very early in training, and with aggressively low-cost training algorithms.
Without modeling such structural information, as shown in (Kondor et al., 2018) and (Xu et al., 2019), the existing MPNNs cannot discriminate between certain non-isomorphic graphs.
 Instead of having access to the transition probabilities or a next-state sampler, we assume only access to a fixed sample of state transitions, where states have been sampled from an unknown distribution and next-states are sampled according to the Markov chain’s transition operator.
 Unfortunately, since it has no control over the devices, the system can do nothing but waiting or ignoring the stragglers.
Branching strategies have significant impacts on the overall problem-solving process, as it directly decides the total number of steps, and consequently the total time, required to solve the problem at hand.
 Also following this line of research are the Multiplicative Integration LSTM (Wu et al., 2016) and – closest to our model in the literature – the Multiplicative LSTM (Krause et al., 2016).
 To check whether low-rank Q matrices are common, we examine the benchmark Atari games, as well as 4 classical stochastic control tasks.
 2) class-dependent learning rate, which decides how much information to use from each class, to automatically handle class imbalance where the number of instances per class can largely vary.
 To make the minimization tractable, it is often assumed the base-pairing has a nested structure (Fig 2 left), and the energy function factorizes pairwisely.
• Memory in a model with N layers is N -times larger than in a single-layer model due to the fact that activations need to be stored for back-propagation.
 Such a representation guides exploration by providing a measure of (di-)similarity between patterns.
 Up to 3 bits per pixel are available for regions corresponding to the monkeys\\u2019 faces, whereas the tree is scored with close to zero bits per pixel.
 In order that this distributed representation across layers be an accurate component-parsing of a visual scene, and capture meaningful and inherent spatial relationships, deeper capsules are constructed from shallower capsules using a mechanism that combines backpropagation-based learning, and consensus-based heuristics.
 However, it is not straightforward to generalize NPs in an analogous way: (i) CNNs require data to live “on the grid” (e.g, image pixels form a regularly spaced grid), while many of the above domains have data that live “off the grid” (e.g, time series data may be observed irregularly at any time t ∈ R).
Main Contributions Our key contributions are:
 As a result, PFNM has better performance and communication efficiency than FedAvg.
 We show that how an agent can take advantage of the scoring function and the learned dynamics model with planning algorithms (Mayne et al., 2000).
 DRNets are inspired and motivated by problems from scientific discovery, such as crystal structure phase mapping.
 For example, stochastic compositional gradient descent (SCGD) (Wang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2016) estimates the inner function G(x) by using an iterative weighted average of the past values of G(x), and then performs the stochastic quasi-gradient iteration.
 While tropical geometry has shown its potential in many applications such as dynamic programming (Joswig & Schröter, 2019), linear programming (Allamigeon et al., 2015), multi-objective discrete optimization (Joswig & Loho, 2019), enumerative geometry (Mikhalkin, 2004), economics (Akian et al., 2009; Mai Tran & Yu, 2015), it has only beenrecently used to analyze DNNs.
 We use projective geometry as an inductive bias to neural networks, allowing the agent to structure its memory with respect to the locations of objects it perceives, as illustrated in Figure 1b.
 The summaries capture the semantics of the inputs and the adversarial examples.
1One training example is composed of an input and its corresponding label.
Unlike explicit regularization, data augmentation improves generalization without reducing the capacity of the model.
 We cast stochastic neural networks as Boolean functions f(z) over Boolean latent variables z sampled from probability1Training a nonlinear sigmoid belief network model with two stochastic layers on MNIST with REBAR took a day and a half on GPU.
 In this way, it projects each data point four times.
 For instance, in the disease diagnosis example, the combination of a certain blood factor and age might be the indicator of a higher level clinical condition which would help the final classification task.
 LIME in particular has gained notable popularity and has been deployed in many applications due to its simplicity.
 For organizations that sell data, it determines the correct value-based pricing of data subsets.
 Is there a way to combine the advantages of both and overcome their shortcomings? Obviously, redesigning a new algorithm is difficult, why not use some simpler ways, such as combining existing methods directly through some general architectures?Based on the above analyses, we propose Cascade Style Transfer (CST) mainly for two targets, i.g,, higher quality and higher flexibility, and design two architectures, i.g,, the Serial Style Transfer (SST) and the Parallel Style Transfer (PST) for these targets.
 (b) One design choice based on a particular dataset is not always applicable to other applications, which harms the generality (Yang et al., 2018).
 Recent advances in computer vision also explore neural architecture search (NAS) methods (Zoph et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019b; Tan et al., 2019) to jointly search micro operations and topology.
 Empirically, the existing primal-dual algorithms may perform poorly for solving (1).
Domain gap between audio and visual images precludes direct adoption of the image priors.
 Prototypes are global feature representations of different classes and are relevant to the inherent semantic structures shared acrossdomains.
 One way to learn skills is to simultaneously train a discriminator to discern the skill-options of the agent (Szepesvari et al., 2014) based on the states of the trajectory (Eysenbach et al., 2019).
” The recommender is a collaborative filtering (CF) model, that predicts items from observed user behavior.
 This can be explained by the fundamental trade-off between accuracy and robustness (Tsipras et al., 2018; Boopathy et al., 2019).
 However, there are also works at the intersection of both often referred to as robustness verification methods, which use verification methods to train robust networks.
 The other is the direct supervised learning, also called Gradient descend, which is a superior, prevalent optimization method for this learning procedure.
The neural network function class (1.1) has been studied in many papers including 3, 15, 33, 36 along with other similar over-parameterized architectures 1, 14, 23.
 To address this issue, we introduce a dual encoding framework for unsupervised inductive representation learning of graphs.
 We then design FALCON by fine-tuning and reordering the results of EHP to improve the accuracy of convolution operations.
 The gradients of this objective can be unbiasedly approximated via the Monte-Carlo method.
 This kind of approaches is able to significantly improve the representation capability of CNNs, and thus achieve better performance in terms of prediction accuracy compared with static approaches.
 To obtain more reliable small object labels, we adopt a different approach in generating the confidence map.
 These methods also avoid gradient vanishing problems and allow for non-differentiable activation functions such as binarized neural networks (Courbariaux et al., (2015)), as well as allowing for complex nonsmooth regularization and the constraints that are increasingly important for deep neural architectures that are required to satisfy practical requirements such as interpretability, energy-efficiency, and cost awareness Carreira-Perpinan & Wang (2014).
 Instead, Gatys et al., (2016), Johnson et al., (2016) are using a modified version of the perceptual loss, allowing generation of finer details in an image.
The first generations of sound-generating GANs, like the WaveGAN and its followers, have been influenced much by the enormously successful generative models for image synthesis.
 Given these motivations, prototypes should be controllable in number, and should be perceptually relevant to the input in explaining the decision making task.
 This gives rise to the notion of a registered loss.
 Both of our graph-embedding network and placement network can be jointly trained in an end-to-end fashion using a supervised reward, without the need to manipulate the loss functions at multiple levels.
 This could add additional bias to results of comparison of classification algorithms since the models could simply apply a graph isomorphism method (or an efficient approximation) to determine a target label at the inference time.
 Popular deep networks such as ResNet (He et al., 2016), DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017b) are all trained by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with lrDecay.
e the semantic similarity between different classes, is part of the "Dark Knowledge", and Bagherinezhad et al., (2018) observed that the "Dark Knowledge" can help to refine noisy labels.
While inducing-point methods capture global correlations among data points through inducing points, inference methods based on local neighbors focus more on correlation structures at local scales.
 The goal is to find the optimal mixing parameters to combine the estimated gram matrix with the target in the semi-Riemannian manifold that maximises the similarity between the combined matrix and the oracle one.
 Consequently unsupervised training is a more practical approach.
 To further encourage the distributions to become closer, we propose to introduce an extra dimension of normalization by mapping the data to ensure they have similar skewness.
Yet this brings in another challenge.
 According to our theoretical analysis, when putting the layer normalization between the residual blocks, the expected gradients of the parameters near the output layer are large.
 And then we construct a normalization approach – removing the mean of inputs and dividing by the scaled l2 norm of inputs before conducting themain operation (convolution or inner-production) of a layer, which can be theoretically ensured to reduce the gradient Lipschitz constant and gradient variance.
 A similar approach was extensively used in domain generalization, fair-prediction, and privacy-protection contexts (Edwards & Storkey, 2016; Motiian et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2017; Iwasawa et al., 2017).
 Similarly, meta-learning approaches (Vanschoren, 2018; Sæmundsson et al., 2018; Clavera et al., 2019) cannot be used here because they typically train an agent on a diverse set of tasks (i.g,, environment instances).
This problem is not confined to the field of natural images: it represents a fundamental challenge for many areas of simulation, most prominently for the field of turbulence simulations (Moin & Mahesh, 1998; Lin et al., 1998).
 These adaptive weighting functions in the module help to adjust the flow of messages and deliver a message of appropriate strength to each node in the graph.
 We create a new loss function that breaks this symmetry and weights the importance of changing the anchor-positive and anchor-negative distances.
 However, for a captioning model to be visually grounded, the model has to predict attentional weights without knowing the word to localize.
In summary, the main contributions of this paper are:
 Therefore, theoretically bounding the robustness of a model (which both protects the privacy and is robust against adversarial examples) is nontrivial.
 Percolation theory mathematically models these physical systems as complex networks and phase transition as a dramatic change of the properties of network connections.
 We observe that the function of RNN is quite similar to a filter.
 It is called homologous test data if the test data comes from the same source as the training data.
 Second, though prediction error has been widely adopted as an effective metric to infer novelty, most of the existing approaches develop novelty model upon short-term prediction error such as 1-step look-ahead.
 Their goal was to overcome difficulty of training deeper DNNs or accelerate it.
 This process is incredibly slow because both the controller and each derived architecture require training.
 This constraint is realized by introducing an auxiliary function that creates a heatmap given a set of interest point parameters.
 We look at the problem from a differential privacy’s point of view and present two types of robustness in this framework.
In this paper, we propose a novel and effective lifelong learning algorithm, called MixEd stochastic GrAdient (MEGA), to address the catastrophic forgetting problem.
 It has been known that in the standard super-vised learning setting, deep neural networks can be easily fooled by adversarial examples (Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014).
 Specifically, our contribution is three-fold:
• Flexible.
 Ma et al., (2017) and Yu et al., (2017) also learned traffic as images but they used LSTM instead to obtain the temporal dependency.
 This observation motivates us to adopt the information bottleneck (IB) framework in reinforcement learning, in order to accelerate the extraction-compression process.
 We first propose beta-Bernoulli dropout that learns to set dropout rate for each individual neuron, by generating the dropout mask from beta-Bernoulli prior, and show how to train it using variational inference.
 In particular, we consider the generalized extreme value (GEV) (Jenkinson, 1955) distribution or generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) (Pickands III et al., 1975; DuMouchel, 1975) to transform the Euclidean space into a probability space defined as, extreme value space.
 These additional but redundant parameters increase the complexity of the model and hinder learning efficiency.
 DIMCO generalizes well to novel datasets because its learning objective encourages the model to compactly use all of its degrees of freedom, thus enabling it to effectively compare datapoints while only requiring a small number of bits per datapoint.
 Finally, it is easy to be deployed into off-the-shelf devices with little hardware co-design to obtain significant performance and energy benefits.
 Motivated by the supervised learning context, where we say training to be generalized if the gap between the training loss and the test loss is small, we can define the generalization for GANs in a similar way.
 There are three different methods to generate masks: using reinforcement learning with a trained model (Li et al., 2016b), generating rationales in an unsupervised manner and jointly with the objective function (Lei et al., 2016), or including annotations during training (Bao et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2016).
By the above examples, we find a problems in present models: These models are shallow, especially CNN.
 It means that there is no an unanimous metric to represent the difference between the true data distribution and the generated distribution (Borji, 2018).
 Two patients with similar symptoms initially may have different futures if they choose different treatments.
Here we provide the first RL approach to deep biologically plausible learning that compares favorably performance-wise to supervised learning results found in the (recent) literature (Amit, 2018; Scellier & Bengio, 2019).
 These algorithms include both model-free algorithms such as DQN (Mnih et al., 2015) and SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018), and model-based policy optimization algorithms such as SLBO (Luo et al., 2019) and MBPO (Janner et al., 2019).
 This constraint can also be applied to paired training data, where it encourages style/attribute transfer between images.
 To this end, we first propose replacing softmax with sparsemax (Martins & Astudillo, 2016).
 NETT considers regularized solutions having a small value of a regularizer defined by a trained neural network.
 Specifically, we first compute the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss (Graves et al., (2006)) of the original audio and the target sentence.
Our key idea to tackle this problem is driven by the following simple observation.
In this study, we consider the problem of approximating the embedding of one node using GNNs in constant time with maximum precision1.
 To speed up convergence, one common enhanced TS solution is to model the expected reward as general linear model (TS-GLM) Chu et al., (2011)Bubeck et al., (2012)Scott (2010) by probit/logit link function with m-way dimension interaction features.
 First, a domain-specific basis convolves spatially only each individual input channel for shift “correction.
In view of these considerations, we propose in this paper a new adaptive DA strategy based on deep generative models.
The presence of temporal noise in localization tasks is ubiquitous given the continuous nature of the perturbation, in contrast to classification noise where only a fraction of the samples are misclassified.
To our knowledge, all existing GNN models mentioned above have a structure of discrete layers.
This research has three contributions:
This makes XLDA compatible with recent methods for pretraining (Lample & Conneau, 2019; Devlin et al., 2018).
ZO optimization can also help to solve automated ML problems, where the gradients with respect to ML pipeline configuration parameters are intractable (Aggarwal et al., 2019).
 Specifically, we report the following compression ratios of the embedding layers: 441 on the IMDB dataset with 0.2% absolute increase in classification accuracy; 15 on the WMT 2014 En–De dataset with 0.3 drop in the BLEU score.
 This projection size for each head is commonly known as the head size.
 Advantages of this approach include its ability to generate style samples via the accompanying prior and the potential for better disentangling between latent style factors (Burgess et al., 2018).
 Unlike teacher-forcing, tokens must be processed one time-step at a time.
In this study, we propose a novel framework based on reflection, which enables word attribute transfer by a single reflection-based mapping for a certain attribute.
 This makes SGD unstable and leads to its poor performance.
 For example, in Gómez-Bombarelli et al., (2018), an auxiliary property prediction task is introduced for a network separate from the encoder/decoder.
 The pre-training-then-fine-tuning paradigm firstly pre-trains BERT on a large scale unsupervised text corpus, then fine-tunes it on task-specific dataset, which greatly increases the difficulty of BERT distillation.
 Furthermore, Bayesian optimization most commonly uses a Gaussian process (GP) model, and it can be quite challenging to achieve highly accurate prediction performance with GPs, given the potentially high dimensional input architectures (Elsken et al., 2018).
 Ideally, we would like to come up with an unsupervised generative model that can generate samples which approximate the data to a high level of accuracy while also giving rise to a disentangled and interpretable representation.
 An encoder is used to produce estimates of the latent variables corresponding to a particular data point, and samples from a predefined prior distribution on the latent space are passed through a decoder to produce new samples from the data distribution.
 Parametric (Goodfellow et al., 2014) (e.g, GAN) methods could not maintain the reality/naturalness of generated sequences, and diversity (e.g, VAE) is hard to preserve.
 In the traditional stereo matching algorithm (Scharstein & Szeliski, 2002), the color similarity metrics of pixels are usually used tocalculate the matching costs between the left and right images to find the matching points in the two images.
 We also revisit TRANSGRAM Coulmance et al., (2015), another joint learning method, to assess the effectiveness of joint learning over mapping-based methods.
 However, to the best of our knowledge, no proposed model is scalable in all three contexts.
 Here a wrapper is understood as a machine learning model that takes any other model and operates without accessing its internals.
 It is a simplified NAS problem, therefore, making it easy to show the ability of the NAS algorithms with weight sharing.
 Informally, this procedure yields small batches with ‘coverage’ similar to that of the large batch – in particular the small batch tries to ‘cover’ all the same modes as are covered in the large batch.
 The embedding/Hankelization is a preprocessing to capture the delay/shift-invariant feature (e.g, non-local similarity) of signals/images.
 Our intuition comes from an observation that the recurrent attention process in the universal self-attention network can memorize implicit dependencies between each node and its neighbors from previous iterations, which can be then aggregated to further capture the dependencies among substructures into latent representations in subsequent iterations; this process, hence, can capture both local and global graph structures.
 How to effectively reduce an over-parameterized model thus becomes the key to compressive deep learning.
 Specifically, BoN could simultaneously grow the structures and train the parameters from a simple initialized network on the data gradually to complex ones.
 We consider on-policy methods for their unbiasedness and stabilitycompared to off-policy methods (Nachum et al., 2017).
 these studies showed applying parser like MST and malt parser on morphological rich languages results a poor performance.
 This signal is sparse, and it is unclear how to manually tweak the reward to maximize the patient’s health condition (Leike et al., 2017; Raghu et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019).
 In multi-head learning, one asks at test time to be able to recognize samples of 0-4 among the classes 0-4 and samples of 5-9 among classes 5-9.
 The currently widely used algorithms are MLEM and OSEM.
 However, their generative model is not invertible because its decoder for graph structure is not built upon invertible flows.
 This metric is useful or even ideal when the target hardware is known in advance but strongly depends on features of the hardware architecture.
 In the extreme case, while the mean of activation and gradients remain constant in deep layers, it would be improbable to achieve mean values for any specific realization of the weights, rendering training difficult.
 In conjunction with a discriminative learning loss, this means that the network is optimized for activation patterns that havehigh uncertainty while simultaneously being predictive of the target variable.
 But there are also more indirect implications, that are not literally expressed, but need to be inferred from the context, such as the implication that the speaker wants the hearer to move away from them.
 The second strategy is using adversarial learning (Goodfellow et al., 2014) to build a minimax game between domain discriminator and feature extractor, where a domain discriminator is trained to distinguish the source from the target while the feature extractor is learned to confuse it simultaneously (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015; Ganin et al., 2016; Tzeng et al., 2017).
 However, if the individual rotations between images are small, żt can be chosen to encode the tangent-space at zt with a single variable.
 Sometimes groups of items are compared, thus the effects of interactions among in-group items come into play, further complicating the model.
 This is essentially the same framework introduced in Bafna et al., (2018), though Bafna et al., (2018) considered only `0 attacks.
 Data (in panel A) gets encoded via a encoder network (B) into a latent representation (C) which is trained to be a mixture of standard Gaussians.
 On the other hand, in online mutual distillation, there is no specific teacher-student role.
 We also show the state-of-the-art adversarial training algorithms are all in fact trying to constrain the model from using the lower order non-robust component to discriminate data of different categories.
Mainstream unsupervised domain adaptation aligns the marginal feature distributions of two domains by methods that include minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (Long et al., 2015; Tzeng et al., 2014a), aligning high-order moments (Zellinger et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2019a), or adversarial training (Tzeng et al., 2017; Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015a).
CONTRIBUTIONSThe main contributions of this work are:
 Instead of asking each agent to report the entire distribution p, we hope to elicit samples drawn from the distribution P truthfully.
 Objective perturbation (Chaudhuri et al., 2011; Kifer et al., 2012; Iyengar et al., 2019) perturbs the objective (i.g,, the empirical loss) then release the minimizer of the perturbed objective.
 We chose as a test case for our calibration method, the direct approach for producing uncertainty: we transform the network output from a single scalar to a Gaussian distribution by taking the scalar as the mean and adding a branch that predicts the standard deviation (STD) as in (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017).
In this work, we first discuss current issues in the evaluation procedure of different DRL algorithms on ALE and their impact.
 Due to the continuous nature of the dosage parameter, adjusting for the bias in the dosage assignments is significantly more complex than for binary (or even multiple) treatments.
 Thus, an evaluation platform design must have a standard way to specify, provision, and introspect evaluations to guarantee repeatability and fairness.
 We assume the class names are known, and we use them to search an existing large collection of images with textual description.
 However, our proposed method alleviates numerical instabilities associated with the multivariate matrix– based approach, which enables estimation of entropy for high-dimensional multivariate data.
 Specifically, we use a private user embedding vector oneach device and train it jointly with the global model.
 Our contributions are the following:
 Each ascent step is modulated by a small step size and a projection step back onto the -ball of x0 to prevent the updated value fall outside the -ball of x0 (Madry et al., 2017):xk = ∏( xk−1 + α · sign(∇x`(hθ(xk−1), y) )(2) where α is the step size, ∏(·) is the orthogonal projection function onto {x′ : ‖x0 − x′‖ ≤ }, and xk is the adversarial example at k-th step.
 Therefore, the informative level mismatch exists between the training LR data and the mobile captured data.
 For example, the Jacobian1 can be used to determine the saliency of a pixel in the classification of the image (Papernot et al., 2016b; Zhang et al., 2018).
 To adapt to the application scenes and avoid the disastrous consequences caused by the potential wrong inference of invisible points, we only forecast visible points in the image.
 Minimizing the objective function L(·), the simplest and most common momentum method, SGDM, is given by the following recursion for variable vector θt ∈ Rp:θt+1 = θt + ηvt, vt = βvt−1 − gt.
 We note that especially DWHT is considered to be a good replacement of the conventional PC layer, as it requires no floating point multiplications but only additions and subtractions by which the computation overheads of PC layers can significantly be reduced.
 While it seems intuitive that more ensembles can improve performance, existing studies show no gains in AL performance beyond 10 models, and even recommend the use of only 5 models (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017; Ovadia et al., 2019).
 Different from the conventional DAE, where the noisy input is generated from the clean data by adding noises in the original space, we propose to generate noisy input by corrupting the clean data in the gradient domain.
In this work, during training, we project the feature data or directly raw image data into the metric space using neural networks model and incorporate labels information in a bidirectional way.
 The training of the RPGAN can then be performed in the same adversarial manner as in traditional GANs.
 The discriminators are functions from the sample space to the real line, that have different interpretations in different GAN variations.
 In order to impute a missing value in such unique multi-dimensional data, it is very useful to look into available data in different dimensions (i.g, time, location and measurement), as shown in fig.  1(c), to capture the intra-correlation individually.
In order to provide both guidance for all states as well as direct supervision for demonstrated states, we propose a new objective function with policy-dependent shaping reward.
 The segmentation branch of Mask R-CNN is based on the output of Region Proposal Network (RPN) in training stage, which ignores the inherently tie in those two tasks and is inconsistent with testing processes.
 In this paper, we propose a flexible encryption algorithm/architecture (called “FleXOR”) to enable fractional sub 1-bit numbers to represent each weight while quantizated bits are trained by gradient descent.
 In fact, we show that searching directly over 20 cells leads to a reduction in test error (0.24 p.p; 8% relative to Liu et al., 2019).
 In their work, they state that some adversarial examples, referred to as ”over-optimized” adversarial examples, have very high logit values, but their magnitude is masked by the softmax function.
 Overall, we make the following contributions:
 Then they learn a linear exploration policy on top of the last hidden layer of the DNN with a more frequent update.
 After the first end-to-end system is established, developers can quickly test the performance of the DL model using a small subset of testing data, and start evaluating the design of the model.
 During training, the likelihood of training samples from p(x) is maximized in latent space, while at inference time, z-samples can trivially be transformed back to the data domain.
 This is true even when the test accuracy on the original task is the same for the wide and narrow networks.
 Deep learning can well learn the characteristics of data in a domain by self-updating.
 TextRank (Mihalcea & Tarau, 2004) encodes sentences in the article as nodes in an undirected graph.
 In the multi-head scenario task ids thus need to be encoded or are often assumed to be given by humans in order to know which classifier to use for prediction.
Our contributions:
 While in VAE, the evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective is irrelevant to the classification loss, making it difficult to learn from the labels directly (Narayanaswamy et al., 2017).
 It applies to both Top 1 and Top k uncertainty.
 Second, modular approaches (Rusu et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2017) add new modules to the learner as new tasks are learned.
 They found that the performance of these approaches is very sensitive to the hyperparameter tuning associated with the augmented objective function and the initial random seed during training.
 APRiL leverages states not only to train the critic, but indirectly also for an image-based actor.
Another standard approach is to consider the Lagrangian and maintain a KKT type optimality condition.
Thus, our method requires no heuristics and is generalizable to various tasks.
 Our approach improves few-shot learning models by a random walk through the embeddings of unlabeled data starting from each class prototype passing through unlabeled data in the embedding space and encourages returning to the same prototype at the end of the prototypical walk (cf.fig.1).
 We apply our approach to autoencoding language models with masked language model objective and show the advantage of the proposed approach in zero-shot transfer.
To better analyze the generalization that supports this robustness, we probe trained agents with specific modifications to their training instructions.
Next, we introduce TriMap, a DR method which focuses on preserving the global structure of the data in the embedding.
 This allows to generalize from the training set to novel, sufficiently similar data.
 This involves assuming that there will be unlabeled2 public data that is sufficiently related to our private data to be useful, but we think this is a reasonable assumption to make, for two reasons: First, it is an assumption made by most of the semi-supervised learning literature (Oliver et al., 2018).
 An alternative approach to studying the game of information aggregation is heuristic, see Golub & Sadler (2016) for a review of many important contributions.
During testing, the trained policies should perform well on unseen MDPs sampled from the family.
The 20BN-Something-something-V2 dataset (Mahdisoltani et al. (2018), hereon Something-something) will be central to our investigations; it contains time-critical classes, agnostic to object appearance, such as move something from left to right or move something from right to left.
Here we refer to this type of out-of-distribution input as out-of-dataset (OOS)1 inputs.
 Organisms are assigned taxonomic labels and thus are placed on the tree.
 We treat the predictions of a Subjective Bayesian GNN (S-BGNN) as nodes’ subjective opinions in a graph modeled as Dirichlet distributions on the class probabilities, and learn the S-BGNN model by collecting the evidence from the given labels of the training nodes (see Figure 1).
 Our key contributions in this work are the following:
 Thus adversarial training can be seen as the worst-case distribution shift in the local proximity of the original training distribution.
 For any x ∈ Rd, Topk(x) ∈ Rd selects the top k largest elements (in terms of the absolute value) of x with corresponding indices and sets other d− k elements to zeros; while Randk(x) ∈ Rd randomly (in a uniform distribution) selects k elements from xwith corresponding indices and other d−k elements are zeros.
 We present a system to effectively use asymptotic constraints for symbolic regression, which has two main parts.
 These high-dimensional data, such as images, are actually embedded in a low dimensional space.
 A crucial question remains to be addressed in order to make VI a success for a wide range of applications: can we automatically choose a suitable divergence which are tailored to specific type of tasks?To answer this question, we propose meta-learning for variational inference (meta-VI) which utilizes the advantages of meta-learning to improve approximate Bayesian inference.
 The first regularization term minimizes the l1 norm between the output distribution given by softmax and the uniform distribution which constitutes a distance metric between the two distributions (Deza & Deza, 2009).
 Training performance is also highly affected by the neural network architecture.
We evaluate UDA on a wide variety of language and vision tasks.
 And yet uniquely, thanks to its careful design and analysis, ALI-G enables accurate optimization of a wide class of deep neural networks using only a single hyper-parameter that does not need to be decayed.
 In particular, we explore the importance of in-domain representation learning for remote sensing at various data sizes and establish new state-of-the-art baseline results.
 For example, the l2 robustness certificate in that case would be equal to ∣f(x)∣/∥∇xf(x)∥.
 In a neural network, such a path is made up of a subset of the total nodes and operations in the model.
 However, the key is, when presented with a new situation, animals do not just imitate, but quickly adapt existing behaviors, and improve them through further experience.
 We argue here that neural network architectures for tabular data should be redesigned to account for a ‘decision-tree-like’ mapping.
 In the no free lunch saying, this also comes with two new challenges: (i) It is non-trivial and more challenging to assemble such heterogeneous tensors and operations (i.g, features, attentions and dynamic weights) in a unified computing block, as compared to the conventional homogeneous feature-tensor-to-feature-tensor transformation; (ii) The search space increases exponentially which leads to a much harder NAS problem.
Taking the counter machine as a simplified formal model of the LSTM, we study the formal properties of counter machines as grammars.
This work discusses the robustness of DNNs from a causal perspective.
 The main contributions of this paper are listed as follows.
 (ii) We then use the surrogate gradient model in the constrained Langevin dynamics in lieu of the black-box potential.
 However, their studies only focused on spatial modeling without temporal dynamics, besides regularization being ad-hoc and difficult to tune the hyper-parameters.
 Our contribution is threefold:
 Their underlying noise levels are not only fixed but also unknown, rendering them infeasible for controlled studies on noise levels.
 These approaches learn embeddings for entities and relations.
In practice, certifiably robust networks often perform worse than adversarially trained models, which in general lack theoretical guarantees.
We demonstrate the role of gradients with an example in fig. 1.
 However, such an approach (ignoring a sensitiveattribute) does not control for any existing correlations that may exist between the sensitive metadata and the edges of a node.
We use “neural program generation” to bridge symbolic program generation and deep neural networks, bringing together some of the best qualities of both approaches.
 For parallel training data, CAST uses two separate encoders to encode the source sentence and its surrounding context, respectively, and a decoder to translate the encoded features into the target sentence.
Our contributions are twofold.
 Methods that take attributes of nearby nodes into account generalizes those that do not, e.g, Perozzi et al., (2017), for which feature vectors can be considered standard basis vectors.
 After receiving the feedback, “Actor” updates it’s belief accordingly, as shown in fig. 1.
 For example, if an image is predicted to be a dog, yet the intermediate activity patterns are somehow atypical of those seen by the network for other dog images during training, then that is a strong indicator of an OOD example.
To address the aforementioned challenges, we present a novel neural network architecture – GraphTranslation-Generative-Adversarial-Nets (GT-GAN).
 Then, the newly updated policy in return guides the expert to generate higher quality samples.
 It achieves ∼ 46.7 times speed-up over Deep Voice 3 (DV3) at synthesis, while maintaining comparable speech quality using a WaveNet vocoder.
 The use of these external NLP tools limits the effectiveness of a model to domains(e.g, news) where those NLP tools perform well.
Our experiments show that CoNAS is able to discover a deep convolutional neural network with test error 2.74± 0.12% on CIFAR-10 classification, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods, including DARTs (Liu et al., 2018b), ENAS (Pham et al., 2018), random search with weight-sharing (RSWS) (Li & Talwalkar, 2019), and the baseline vanilla random search method (Liu et al., 2018b) interms of test error, search time, model size, and number of multiply-add operations.
 Sensitivity map methods include vanilla gradient (Simonyan et al., 2013), deconvolution (Zeiler & Fergus, 2014), guided backpropagation (Springenberg et al., 2014), SmoothGrad (Smilkov et al., 2017), integrated gradient (IG) (Sundararajan et al., 2017) to name a few.
 Among these curricula, cluster curriculum is newly proposed in this paper.
 This technique has been used in Dosovitskiy & Brox (2016b); Johnson et al., (2016); Dosovitskiy & Brox (2016a) and our method follows this line of work.
Fortunately, a GLM model naturally exists in the last layer of most discriminative architectures of DNNs (See appendix A.3 for the reason that the last layer is a GLM layer).
 The motivation of this work is the interpretation of CNNs: pruned and unpruned filters are analyzed to evaluateclass-wise relations and dependencies.
 They utilize hard labels of the attacked model to generate adversarial examples.
 The affinity graph for these data points is shown in Figure 1(a) (details of constructing such graph is discussed in Section 4.2).
 For the second method, re-pretraining the BERT from scratch will cost a mass of computing time and resources.
 Among them, some models regard the noise as a kernel estimating problem which can be solved by addictive Gaussian noises.
 Compared to normalizing flows, a key advantage of our theory is that it does not require any specific network architecture, except differentiability, and we do not need to solve ODEs like in continuous normalizing flows.
 It is therefore helpful to generate a diverse collection of alternative ways of synthesizing the given target molecule.
 The robot arm can employ an optimal controller to dexterously retrieve an object given exact knowledge of all objects.
 Incorrectly modeling sentence density by using a given sentence structure 60% of the time instead of 40% of the time is relatively harmless.
 The main contributions are summarized as follows.
We propose to resolve these issues by leveraging a pre-trained generative model of the state-action space, p(a|s), trained on known sequences of interaction data.
To overcome the sparsity issue in reward settings, hierarchical RL has shown its superiority under the sparse reward setting (Kulkarni et al., 2016; Le et al., 2018; Levy et al., 2018).
 For instance, reading the final chapter of a book after all the previous ones takes on a different meaning compared to reading the same text by itself.
In this paper, we present an online training scheme amenable to NVM memories to enable next generation edge devices.
 Unlike earlier attempts in combining the level set method with CNNs, we benefit from NODEs parametrization of the derivative of the contour because it allows us to incorporate external constraints that guide the contour evolution, e.g, by adding a regularization penalty to the curvature of the front or exploiting images at the evolving front by extracting appearance constraints in a non-supervised way.
 In particular, BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) produces a bidirectional Transformer encoder (Vaswani et al., 2017) by training it topredict values of masked tokens and whether two sentences follow each other in a natural discourse.
 Empirical results indicate that NormLIME identifies features vital to the classification performance more accurately than several existing methods.
 QBF is an extension of propositional formula, which allows quantifiers (∀ and ∃) over the Boolean variables (such as ∀x1∃x2. (x1 ∨ ¬x2) ∧ (¬x1 ∨ x2)).
 This introduces computational overheads e.g, pre-computing the relative difficulty of samples, and also reduces the effective amount of data from which a model canlearn in early epochs.
 This poses a bottleneck for flow models to scale with increasing input dimensions due to computational complexity.
 As a result, despite having a strong intuition at first sight, MBRL has to be designed meticulously.
 To mitigate this problem, Transformer introduces position embeddings, whose effects,however, have been shown to be limited (Dehghani et al., 2018; Al-Rfou et al., 2018).
 Thus dynamically discovering the appropriate representation of individual players according to their role in a formation affords us structural information while learning a useful representation for subsequent tasks.
 To our knowledge, this is the first work to shed light on the trade-offs pruning incurs by considering new measures beyond test accuracy.
 Built upon the ideas of options framework (Sutton et al., 1999) and motor skills (Lin, 1993), we formulate the temporal abstraction problem as learning a latent representation of action sequences.
 Our main contributions are:
 They rely on a slot-structured representation (see Figure 1) of the scene where the latent space is a set of vectors and each vector of the set is supposed to represent an “object” (which we refer to as “entity”) of the scene.
 Some classical examples are Independent Component Analysis; Hidden Markov models (Rabiner & Juang, 1986); Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Tipping & Bishop, 1999); Gaussian-Process Latent variable model (Lawrence, 2005) and factor analysis.
 In particular, it shows that standard regularization and data augmentation are generally useful and improve upon standard GAIL.
 For example, MTSL (Duan et al., 2019) separates selecting and rotating step by selected learning, and applies the transitional greedy method to perform final positioning step.
 The conventional classifier-based methods also ignore the abstractness of attributes.
In comparison to the existing work on interpretability, we analyze attention mechanism on a more diverse set of NLP tasks that include text classification, pairwise text classification (such as NLI), and text generation tasks like neural machine translation (NMT).
 Second, the adversarial training requires a larger model capacity than the natural training does.
 For example, we have a deep learning (Goodfellow et al., 2016) classification model which performs the best among multiple models when used in the ensemble method.
 It first samples some K perturbed vectors vkt from a Gaussian distribution, then a pseudo-gradient gt is constructedAlgorithm 1 Gaussian smoothing.
 However, Grad-CAM only provides the overall highlighted regions of two input images, the relationship between each activated region of two images is yet to be uncovered.
 These atomic connections can provide more flexible and accurate chemical information, which is critical in many related chemical tasks like molecular representation (Duvenaud et al., 2015; Gilmer et al., 2017) and chemical reaction prediction (Jin et al., 2017; Do et al., 2019).
 Viewing X as an n-by-d matrix, the i-th row of X can be thought of as the feature vector for the i-th subject.
 The primary issue with this approach is it penalizes the entire image reconstruction when we care only about the foreground, resulting in landmarks being allocated to the background.
Summary of Contributions.
 Kernelized potential functions (Lafferty et al., (2004)), gaussian energy functions (Krähenbühl & Koltun (2011)), or semantic-driven potential functions (Lan et al., (2011)) are developed in varied cases to adapt to specific tasks.
 Hard-negative examples can cause big trouble in model training, because the nuance between positive examples and hard-negative examples can cause confusion for a model trained from scratch.
 Rae et al., (2019) further proposed Neural Bloom Filter that learns to write to memory using a distributed write scheme and achieves compression gains over the classical Bloom filter.
 Recently, it has been shown that there exist smaller sub-networks within large neural networks, which when trained in isolation provide similar utility as the large networks (Frankle & Carbin, 2018; Frankle et al., 2019).
 In contrast, more recent methods use node features but, as we will show, are unable to preserve the graph structures after pooling (Ying et al., 2018; Gao and Ji, 2018), limiting their interpretability.
 The standard discriminator, as a painting master, merely grades the student’s painting and hopes that can help the student improve his work.
 Consequently, SAEs are physically realizable, and it is easy to understand how the changes in semantics results in an adversarial example.
 In order to leverage the advantages of these methods, we formulate RL exploration as a planning problem in the state space.
 That the perplexity of generated text is so much higher than it is under the true distribution suggests that there are significant gaps in our current methodologies in accurately learning language models, particularly if we are interested in generating text that globally resembles the modeled language itself.
 Inspired by this observation, we identify a successful discriminability indicator by measuring one embedding’s distance with class centroids and compute the ratio of between positive and hardest-negative, where the positive is its distance with its class’s corresponding centroid and the hardest-negative is the closest counterpart.
Inspired by the lighting and shadowing phenomena in nature, we propose a simple yet effective black-box method, called Gaussian light and shadow (GLAS), which simulates feature perturbation as the presence or the absence of light at the pixel level of an image.
 The estimator formalizes a dependency factor Cπ , representing the contribution level of each future reward to advantage function estimation.
(1) or small values of the channel features (In this paper, inhibited channel is defined as channel whose all feature values are less than 1e− 2).
 This requires inferring the posterior over the latent states, pθ(s1:T , z1:T |v1:T ), where vt = (xt,ut) contains all the visible variables at time t.
 Typical approaches in the peer prediction literature design scoring functions to score each reported data using another noisy reference answer, without accessing ground truth information.
The behavioral test functions underpin all our algorithms, directing optimization towards desired behaviors.
In this paper, we propose an actor-critic approach for temporal predictive clustering, which we call AC-TPC.
 The third component, is the output layer which maps the output of function f to the vocabulary-space, followed by a softmax function.
 A priori sparsity, where the sparse network topology is selected before training has started, is a promising approach that allows the user to finely and transparently tune the ratio of information bandwidth to memory requirements.
 For example, Cluster-GCN (Chiang et al., 2019) separates the graph into several clusters, and in every iteration of training, only one or a few clusters are picked to calculate the stochastic gradient for the mini-batch.
 In particular, people found that carefully-tuned SGD, combined with proper momentum, weight decay and appropriate learning rate decay schedules, can significantly outperform adaptive gradient algorithms eventually (Wilson et al., 2017).
 Over-parameterization has been recently used as a hammer to tackle the optimization property (Allen-Zhu et al., 2018b; Du et al., 2018; Zou et al., 2018; Zou and Gu, 2019) of neural network.
 Whereas detectors represent all classes of interest in theirs weights, trackers are expected to form a representation of the target object using a template image.
 The best architecture is sampled from the distribution after optimization.
 The comparison of an expected salinecy map to others are shown in fig. 1(a)3.
 Figure 1 provides a visualization of our approach; we defer the full details to Section 3.
 To address this issue, Wang et al., (Wang et al., 2015) implemented a Sparse Coding based Network (SCN) for image SR, by combining the merits of sparse coding and deep learning, which fully exploits the approximation of sparse coding learned from the LISTA (Gregor & LeCun, 2010) based sub-network.
 The natural idea is therefore using only robust features for learning.
 It is challenging to optimize Eq.
 Unfortunately, the issues facing MD libraries are even more pronounced when combining MD with deep learning, which typically involves complicated derivatives that can take weeks to derive and implement.
 We show that PGAs enable training generative autoencoders with maximum likelihood, without restrictions on architectures or latent dimensionalities.
 Since the cursor itself is continuous and the whole search procedure can be considered as a differentiable architecture search (DAS) process, which can be effectively solved based on an alternative optimization strategy.
Motivated by this observation, we design a new generative cleaning network with quantized nonlinear transform to first destroy the sophisticated noise patterns of adversarial attacks and then recover the original image content damaged during this nonlinear transform.
 To show the low-pass filtering nature of GCN-like models, Wu et al., (2019) used the Rayleigh quotient to bound the maximum eigenvalue when self-loops are added to the graph, which means adding self-loops created a stronger low-pass filter (Wu et al., 2019, Lemma 3, Theorem 1).
 While the notion of recursive neural networks is not new, our work is neither concerned with syntax-guided composition (Tai et al., 2015; Socher et al., 2013; Dyer et al., 2016) nor unsupervised grammar induction (Shen et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2018; Havrylov et al., 2019; Yogatama et al., 2016).
 We focus on the problem of verified training for consistency rather than post-facto verification.
 See Appendix A.sistency.
 US-Net (Yu & Huang, 2019) proposes to compute batch normalization statistics after training, and introduces two training techniques to train a network that is executable at any network widths.
In this work, we approach the problem of PBL from a different angle.
 To capture both local and global structure in spectrograms with hundreds of thousands of dimensions, we employ a multiscale approach which generates spectrograms in a coarse-to-fine manner.
 We show that a full access approach to obtain feedback on every state-action pair while RL agent is learning, can significantly speedup the training convergence of RL agent.
We propose a method specifically designed for GNN that naturally avoids the problems of methods above.
 Since our proposed methodology does not require test-timeaccess to sensitive attributes, and can be applied to any standard classification or regression task, it can also be used to reduce risk disparity between outcomes, acting as an adaptive risk equalization loss compatible with unbalanced classification scenarios.
 Here, we identify TSC as a practical downstream taskfor which GAN generation is consistently useful across data types and classification tasks and develop GAN-assisted TSC (GAN-TSC) to improve the TSC of an arbitrary classifier.
 However, in a discriminative GMM, a method to optimize M simultaneously during learning has not been clearly formulated.
 Figure 2 shows 24-hour temporal patterns in the spatial neighborhood of a selected smoothregion (2a) and a selected unsmooth region (2b).
 However, it is also challenging to detect common and specific causal structures simultaneously.
 The model incorporates a multimodal decoder, in the form of an EBM, which we show under mild assumptions can be trained similarly to a conditional GAN, where the conditioning is the latent code of a VAE.
 In this work, we propose to implement compositionality ideas via energy based models (EBMs).
 Deep learning methods for outlier detection not only overcome the limitations of density and distance based methods, but they can also leverage the inherent featurization capabilities of deep networks.
 Moreover, our proposed metrics are general and computationally inexpensive.
 However, when the answer to the question is “no,” the previous methods have difficulty on providing logical bases.
 Schmidt et al., (2018) shows that adversarially robust generalization requires much more labeled data than standard generalization in certain cases.
 Labeling functions also motivate a metric for learning, which we call programmatic style-consistency, to evaluate calibration of policies: rollouts generated for a specific style should return the same style label when fed to the labeling function.
 In LS loss and MS loss, a positive pair interacts with all positive pairs and all negative pairs.
 Unimodal data refers to data with only one modality such as image, video, or text.
Contributions.
 However, a higher-order model for high-dimensional data (e.g, video) requires a huge number of model parameters, and the computation grows exponentially with the order of the RNNs.
 The main drawback is the overhead incurred while implementing such technique on the target platform.
Though existing GCNs share basic common features with lattice CNNs in terms of localized parameter sharing, the ways in which deep network architectures can be constructed based thereon are more limited in comparison.
Our proposed method, i.g,, DMPN, works as follows.
 It is possible that the minimal loss paths between a network and all networks equivalent to a second network could be quite different.
 Also, let fSn denote a function by a deep neural network which satisfies an invariant property, f(x) = f(σ · x) holds for any x ∈ Rn×D where σ is an arbitrary permutation of D-dimensional coordinates in x.
 The approach is justified by novel theoretical results, which show that the reconstruction ability of a set of features bounds its performance in downstream supervised learning tasks.
 To summarize, this research is motivated by two questions:1. What is the inner mechanism resulting in these two good properties of word embedding?2. How does the parameter α influence the word embedding? Can we find a method to determine its optimal value?1We will explain the meaning of these variables (e.g, Ud) in the following sections.
 Most latent variables in such deep hierarchical VAEs have no clear semantic meanings, just a technique for reaching good lower-bounds.
In this paper, we first discuss the relevance of controlling the bi-Lipschitz bounds of invertible networks.
 Further, for the more challenging `∞ attack, Gaussian smoothing provably degenerates in high dimensions.
In addition to strong empirical performance, deep k-NN filtering has a couple of advantages.
 In this work, we propose a methodlogy for estimating the fairness-accuracy Pareto front of a fully-connected feedforward network.
This paper describes a novel method for training highly flexible posterior approximations.
In order to address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel method, Graph Entities with Step Mixture via random walk (GESM), which considers information from all nodes in the graph and can be generalized to new graphs by incorporating random walk and attention.
Majority of the listed methods are heuristics which are constructed according to certain desirable qualities.
 Ilyas et al., (2019) further analyze and show that deep convolutional features can be categorized into robust andnon-robust features, while non-robust features may even account for good generalization.
 The best achievable complexity trade-off is what we define as Information for the task.
 Consequently, this approach is not scalable to RL problems of practical size.
In this paper, we introduce a Random Distance Prediction (RDP) model which trains neural networks to predict data distances in a randomly projected space.
 This makes decision-based attacks converge to a sub-optimal perturbation.
To the success of these sample-selection methods, the memorization effect of deep networks (Zhang et al., 2016; Arpit et al., 2017) is the crux.
 Idea is for each network to clean up predictions of previous one in order to progressivelyimprove overall accuracy.
 If the attacker is aware of this difference, the attacker can concentrate on attacking the key steps.
Contributions.
Identifying ‘unsupervised’ (or task-agnostic) decision states is advantageous in scenarios where: 1) rewards are sparse or absent (Pathak et al., 2017), 2) for an agent to learn meaningful behaviour, proxy goals and rewards need to be hand engineered (making it hard to scale), and 3) the notion of a goal might not even be obvious, e.g, in continuous control tasks (Lillicrap et al., 2015).
 Contribution.
 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle this challenging problem formulation.
Contributions.
 Multiple draws then approximate a posterior of the dynamic model and the variance in future state prediction based on this posterior is used as an intrinsic reward for exploration.
Despite these advances, individual data augmentation methods that improve robustness do so at the expense of reduced clean accuracy.
 We conclude that the entropy term in the objective for Soft Actor Critic principally addresses the bounded nature of the action spaces in the Mujoco environments.
 Finally, we evaluate the performance of semi-supervised approaches to winning ticket generation.
It is crucial to establish such dual maps z = f(x) and x = g(z).
 This motivates us to design a new signal extraction mechanism operating in the frequency domain.
 Similarly, past work targeted at compressing GANs for simple image synthesis fall short when they are applied to large tasks.
 Detailed ablation study also demonstrates that the combination of MLM+ITM+MRC-kl+MRFR yields the best pre-training performance.
 To address this issue, many stochastic hard thresholding methods have been proposed.
 Thus, to enable a policy to learn good visual representations, we can treat the uncertainty model as a representation learning model.
 We refer to a trained global model as the initial model, and the locally adapted model as the personalized model.
 Thus at least in the simplest single-mode setting, there is evidence that the global landscape of (some) GANs is compelling.
 These language GANs pre-train both the generator (G) and the discriminator (D) before adversarial learning.
 Analogizing the seen abstract predicates to the unseen ones further escalates the difficulty.
A natural representation, which is independent of rotation and translation is the Euclidean distance matrix, which is the matrix of all squared pairwise Euclidean distances.
 Several methods based on statistical learning have also recently been developed to tackle the issue of conformation generation.
 The model learns to perform imputation for the target domain while aligning the distributions of the source and target domains in a latent space, thus going beyond the simple juxtaposition of a data imputation module followed by a domain-invariant featurerepresentation learning module.
 The learner then uses an augmented training set which includes both the real and the hallucinated examples to learn classifiers.
In this paper, we propose supervised deep infomax (SDIM) by introducing supervised statistical constraints into deep infomax (DIM, Hjelm et al., (2018)), an unsupervised learning framework by maximizing the mutual information between representations and data.
 However, the existing methodsstruggle to compete with the existing highly optimized solvers.
 In this paper, we propose a model that performs classification in a novel task by focusing on the differences between closely related classes of its support set.
 This eliminates the need for the data preprocessing described above, and so avoids the distortions thereby introduced.
 This objective provides us with a principled way for training a policy to explore all states, by maximizingH(S), such that the state that is reached can be controlled by commanding goals, which means minimizingH(S | G).
The theoretical arguments are confirmed by the performed experiments where we observe that, differently from what was argued in previous works (Higgins et al., 2017; Burgess et al., 2018), it is possible to train a model that is able to learn good (able to generalise) representations while maintaining optimal generative performance.
 In particular, the minimum norm estimator minimizes a generic parameter norm while the test error is measured by a possibly different norm on the parameter error vector which depends on the data distribution (Section 4.1).
 Therefore, it is desirable that the model size can be flexibly changed according to the resources of the target devices without re-training the model, which we refer to as scalability in this paper.
 Due to the abstracting property of deep encoders, this restriction guides the inverse maps to learn semantically similar mappings, and the model achieves a semantically plausible manifold alignment.
From a methodological perspective, we argue that supervised few-shot classification becomes an awkward task in the ideal case where the class semantics are perfectly consistent.
 Recent work on flow based priors (Chen et al., 2017; Ziegler & Rush, 2019), have focused only on the unconditional (plain VAE) case.
 The choice of the counterfactual distribution affects the quality of the explanation.
 There are two advantages of VAENAS: 1) it learns the good-performing architecture distribution which could be used to reduce search space.
 Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
 DHN can be applied for soft-SSL using existing tools from optimal transportation (Section 3).
 We postulate that this is due to the combination of their large capacity and the highly unconstrained learning setup of typical supervised deep models, and that incorporating elements from human visual perception and biological constraints can add a positive inductive bias that may yield better, more robust representations.
 Such approaches suffer from two problems: (i) For complex tasks which requires sophisticated control strategies, it would be quite inefficient to directly learn such policy with one nonlinear function approximator and the adaptation to new tasks is prone to be inaccurate.
 A key insight of our methodology is the fact that any piece of information about the state of the environment that is used by the policy to make a decision, but is not available to the model, acts as a confounding variable for that model.
3. The gradient constraints only assure to avoid catastrophic forgetting, but might not promote positive backward knowledge transfer in some scenarios.
 The main observation here is that the above-mentioned algorithm for computing CNTK involves a dynamic programming whose recursion depth is equal to the depth of the corresponding finite CNN.
 The reason is that many timesteps are spent on these additional objectives without reward.
 Significantly, these new results stem from a single, simple observation: differentially-private learning with DP-SGD is different enough that all aspects of learning—model architecture, parameter initialization, and optimization strategy, as well as hyperparameter tuning—must be reconsidered.
Recently, Liu et al., (2019) proposed a method of reducing computation during training and inference by constructing a dynamic sparse graph (DSG) using random projection for dimensionality reduction.
 The strength of the latter penalty is controlled through aparameter b > 0. fig.  1 demonstrates the effect of the entropy penalty on the compressibility of the intermediate activations.
 Generating high model compatibility data via GANs is still under explored.
In this paper, we propose an algorithm that finds a middle ground by using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Kocsis & Szepesvári, 2006) to perform local trajectory improvement over states sampled from different time steps in the trajectory unrolled from the policy.
 It allows the networks to preserve their model size similarly to ternary weights.
 That is, the abiltity of an adversary to distinguish a member from a non-member improves with change in test distributions.
 To implement such a memory, we introduce the concept of imaginary context that augments the set of real context points observed at any time-step.
 Each worker calculates gt,k and sends it to the server or other workers for updating w.
 We will consider two models: the teacher task, where the label is obtained as a function of the high-dimensional input; and the latent task, where the label is a function of only the lower-dimensional latent representation of the input.
 This includes systems that learn to do source and channel coding jointly from data.
Other works using machine learning to guide a prover (Chvalovský et al., 2019; Jakubuv & Urban, 2017; Kaliszyk & Urban, 2015b; Kaliszyk et al., 2018; Loos et al., 2017; Urban et al., 2011) usually deal with large mathematical corpora, while we focus on a fragment of Robinson Arithmetic, which is a limited and simple theory.
 Notably, the circuit, which can be quite large depending on the complexity of the constraints, can be thrown away after learning.
 This is because, the reconstruction log-likelihood in the VAE objective is at odds with the divergence to the latent prior (Tabor et al., 2018) (also in case of alternatives proposed by Makhzani et al., (2016); Arjovsky et al., (2017)).
 Given examples D = {(xi, yi)}Ni=1, these methods jointly train a VAE on inputs x and a predictive model g : Z → R, g(z) = y mapping from latent codes z to targets y, to then perform the optimization w.r.t. y in the low-dimensional, continuous latent space Z instead of in input space X (GómezBombarelli et al., 2018).
 This can already help many applications that do not require exact match or need a more efficient pre-processing step.
 For instance, adversarial training is ineffective against our approach.
 To allow the model to capture nonlinear interaction, it is appealing to consider the non-convex extension of the LASSO formulation using neural networks.
 2) TRANSFORM: Learn a sparse transformation from anchors to all objects (§3.2).
 Our main contributions are summarized as follows
 Deep ensembles were inspired by the bootstrap (Breiman, 1996), which has nice theoretical properties.
While there has been a recent surge in fast and accurate differentiable simulators not previously available, most applications for control have relied on established local methods such as MPC (de Avila Belbute-Peres et al., 2018), gradient descent (Degrave et al., 2019), or trajectoryoptimization (Hu et al., 2019) to solve control tasks.
 We perform a sequence of careful experiments to understand why previous approaches did not work well.
 Moreover, the study of these perturbations might lead to new insights on how deep neural networks actually work.
 The parameter divergence can be regarded as a direct response to learners’ local data being non-IID sampled from the population distribution, of which the excessive magnitude could disturb the performance of the consequent parameter averaging.
 In contrast, optimization over the nuisance space is slow and results in overfitting due to higher variance.
Please see Appendix A for a detailed description of the notation used in this paper.
 We can optionally perform a second task (Task 2) that focuses on the separation of instances that are connected without a clear boundary dividing them.
 For example, given the user query "what is diabetes type 2" as input, DeepXML predicts that ads corresponding to the bid phrases "what is type 2 diabetes mellitus", "diabetes type 2 definition", "do i have type 2 diabetes", etc.
 In practice, we are interested in encouraging our decoder to use as few steps as possible, both to speed up decoding at inference time as well as to reduce the potential for making mistakes.
 Our results establish the following:
 Another line of research focuses on Kernel two sample test (8), where the kernel trick is used to evaluate mean discrepancy of two samples in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space.
 It is therefore much harder to model the relationship across pixels both spatially and temporally simply because the dimensionality is much higher.
This paper adapts existing state-of-the-art image-level OOD detection methods to the new task of pixel-level OOD classification and compares their performance on a new dataset designed for this task.
 How can these data be well represented and high-level information be extracted by an algorithm? (2) The sample sizes of modern data sets are often extremely large and most of them are unlabelled.
 Instead of maximizing the mutual information, we propose to maximize the entropy of the visited states directly, i.g,, maximizing h(S) = h(Z) +h(S|Z)\\u2212h(Z|S), where Z is a random variable that represents the reference points of promising areas for exploration.
 However, these models are often criticized for their lack of interpretability and theoretical guarantees (Lucas et al., 2018).
 If not, the representation is limiting, and subject to error.
Semi-supervised learning (Chapelle et al., 2006) and active learning can be seen as two facets of the same problem: the former focuses on most certain model predictions on unlabeled examples, while the latter on least certain ones.
 To this end, we devise a generalized evaluation methodology and choose the NER task as a case study.
 One conception of sustainability, social equity, which can be measured by the distributable benefit accessibility (Behbahani et al., 2019), has been acknowledged important.
 Recently, many deep learning-based style transfer algorithms have been applied for non-parallel VC task.
To our knowledge, this computational problem is novel.
 In addition, this requires a classifier that classifies all classes from the generated images.
 Thus, if we1Source code will be available if the paper is acceptedcan design networks which not only achieve high accuracy but are robust to quantization, higher performing hardware solutions are possible.
 Overall, we make the following contributions:
 Adopting the machine learning nomenclature, we shall henceforth refer to the given entries ofM as training set or training samples, and denote by test set a subset of the (unknown) entries ofM which we shall use for evaluation.
 These approaches do not change the processing pipeline or increase computational and memory demand during inference.
 So weighted multiset automata provide a new theoretical and intuitive justification for sinusoidal position encodings.
 To the extent to which a learner reacts to such nuisance variations, which carry no information about the output, it will incur a performance change in expectation.
In this work, we introduce a novel method, that learns the sharing pattern jointly with the model parameters using standard back-propagation.
 Compared to models such as sparse coding and ICA, our model serves a more direct purpose of perceiving local motions.
 We build a model-based natural media environment using deep CNN and train a natural media painting agent using model-based reinforcement learning.
 Building on past work, we examine the utility of self-supervision on sequential data when additional data are unavailable, and we propose new types of self-supervision tasks.
 As a by-product, we obtain a novel data augmentation mechanism which takes advantage of the scale invariance properties of Z to generate synthetic sentences that keep invariant the attribute of the original sentence.
 In other words, we will remove many connections (synapses) from both the recurrent and non-recurrent portions of the neural network.
 However, the communication costs to share and synchronize huge gradient vectors and parameters increases dramatically as the size of the distributed systems grows.
 While these papers studied the properties of the conjugate kernels, especially the spectrum in the large-depth limit, a branch of concurrent work made a stronger statement: that many networks converge to Gaussian Processes as their width becomes large (Lee et al., 2018; Matthews et al., 2018; Novak et al., 2019b; Yang, 2019).
 Singh et al.,(2019) create sentence embeddings by defining a Context Mover’s Distance over words occurring in different contexts and Wu et al., (2018) create text document embeddings with feature maps by estimating the distance of a document to a range of arbitrarily created documents.
 In our experiments we use the RNN (Elman, 1990) and the Linear Memory Network (LMN) (Bacciu et al., 2019).
 In summary, we make the following contributions:
 Simonovsky & Komodakis (2017) construct the hierarchy through a combined use of spectral polarity and Kron reduction.
 For the word “tim”, the most related words should be ”heart” and the immediate words.
Our results in this paper pertain specifically to the ‘trajectory length’ measure of expressivity.
 For example, Facebook uses a system called Rosetta to extract texts from over 1 billion user-uploaded images every day (Maria, 2018).
 They all make use of supervision and require the availability of a ground truth, which is absent in many real-world problems.
 Our multi-headed approach—which we name Hydra—can be seen as an interpolation between the full ensemble of models and the knowledge distillation proposed by Hinton et al., (2015).
 This generalization has intimate connections with direct optimization of both forward and inverse KullbackLeibler (KL) divergences with respect to empirical distribution and model distribution.
 For complex problems, the above setup has to be supplemented by an exploration strategy.
 Note that the confidence denotes the likelihood that two faces belong to the same person.
 Furthermore, unlike in traditional MCMC methods, the samples generated by EI from the last state of the MCMC chain are independent and have no correlations.
 We harness existing recent work on insertion-based methods that utilize semi-autoregressive models that are permutation-invariant to the joint factorization.
 In other words, for different graph data, we should adopt different graph convolutional filters to achieve optimal performance.
 Furthermore, we evaluate our model on image completion as a 2D regression problem on the MNIST and CelebA data-sets, using only a small subset of known pixel values.
Contributions: In a nutshell, this paper introduces:
 We call these hidden incentives for distributional shift (HIDS), and note that keeping HIDS hidden can be important for achieving aligned behavior.
 Attentional Factorization Machines (Xiao et al., 2017) employs a neural attention network to additionally weight each interaction term in FMs.
 Nevertheless, the attempt of self-frame prediction to predict the encoded current state inherently neglects motion features in the observations.
 Consequently, existing methods are not able to reason about the latent alignment between the visual and language representations comprehensively.
 However, unstable molecules and crystals are often not considered, although this would allow discovering new stable configurations.
 These relation conditions describe relation-specific mappings between entity embeddings, i.g,relation representations, providing a “blue-print” against which to consider knowledge graph representation models.
 The harder samples with respect to a given network state are defined as those yielding higher loss, which are estimated through backpropagation (Hinton et al., 2006).
 One of the talents of humans is that humans heavily rely on to make safe decisions is that we could understand the latent information of complicated situation or environment and awareness, whether it is safe or dangerous (Bubic et al., 2010).
While this method has shown promising results, it requires expensive stochastic rounding hardware built into the critical compute path making it unattractive for systolic array and GEMM accelerator implementations.
 These observations suggest that past update directions are promising candidates for surrogate gradients.
 For neurons in the first layer, such boundaries are hyperplanes, for which the equations determine the weights and biases of the first layer (up to sign and scaling).
 We argue that such a multi-modal teaching approach enables robots to acquire complex policies that generalize to a wide variety of environmental conditions.
 And the cluster structured sparsity (CSS) is one of the most important cases, where the zero/nonzero entries appear in clusters.
More recently, Franceschi et al., (2019) presented a new approach for jointly learning the graph and the parameters of GNNs, where they learnt a discrete probability distribution on the edges of the graph by approximately solving a bilevel program.
 It also helps to avoid overfitting as it prevents a node committing too earlyfor a specific pattern, or in other words, it postpones the decision as late as possible so that various discriminant information in the training data can be fully considered.
 At a high level, the idea is to maintain an abstraction capturing all possible behaviors of both the audio processing stage and the neural network.
 The system scales to large input sizes and networks such as ImageNet classification.
 This is equivalent to calculating the differentiation of the BNN’s prediction for arbitrary data, because the difference of prediction for the new data is the line integration of the gradient of prediction over the new data.
Related to observation 1 and 2, we prove the existence of numerous connected high-dimensional plateaus extending across the landscape due to weight-space symmetries.
To address the above problems, we propose a novel knowledge transfer method as illustrated in Figure 1(d).
Our contributions.
 Additionally, notice that the word apple is topically/thematically contextualized (topic-word association) by different semantics in S1-S3 and referring to a Company.
 The entropy regularization was first introduced by Williams & Peng (1991) and now used by many contemporary algorithms (Mnih et al., 2016; Schulman et al., 2017; Teh et al., 2017; Farebrother et al., 2018).
 We propose two interactive algorithms that both enforce the connectivity prior (to be more precise in Sec.2.1).
 However, GR-based approaches have two shortcomings.
 Furthermore, a compensation term has to be considered in the objective function because thedistinct between primitive skills and transitional skills will lead to the decline of multual information between the latent variable corresponding to primitive skills and states generated by transitional skills.
Challenging: Capture problems that human programmers can solve easily but which foil computers.
In this paper, we formulate the problem of flow data completion in large empty areas as an inpainting problem, but consider the mathematical equations that model the underlying fluid phenomena in the design of the network architecture and loss functions.
Although the analysis is based on htanh function, this conclusion equally applies to BNNs that use STE, a htanh-like, back propagation scheme.
 However, these methods fail to converge to a sparse pre-trained model without incurring significant accuracy drop, or in many cases do not converge at all (see supporting results in Appendix).
 We call the proposed model ROOTS (Representation of Object-Oriented Three-dimensional Scenes).
If a system can achieve M times speedup on N machines, the scalability is defined as M/N .
In summary, our contributions are the following:
 Measuring the size of the gradient of D requires a metric on the space of samples, typically chosen to be `2.
For the single-layer behavior, we seek to measure the W-distance between the distribution in an iteration and the target distribution.
 By feeding back predictions as input over multiple time steps, the model becomes more robust to its own prediction errors without the need for a hidden state.
 Furthermore, it has been shown that many real-world networks are scale-free (Albert & Barabási, 2002), which means there exist many low-degree nodes.
 For example, if we set the feature value to 0 in rgb images, this introduces a bias in the attribution map that favors the bright pixels.
 We also make our representation interpretable, as our generator network provides a 3D mesh as an output.
 In this method, we introduce an additional prior distribution p̄(z) in the latent space, where the representations of negative samples are meant to be mapped by the inference model of the VAE machinery.
 Zenke et al., (2017) slowed down learned on weights important for the previous tasks by using path integrals of loss-derivatives.
 Evolution proceeds in generations.
 Crucially, we aim to do this in an unsupervised manner: we do not want to inform the process of the kind of structural information we want to obtain.
 Nakkiran et al., (2019) used information theoretical approach to show that networks obtained by stochastic gradient descent can be explained by a linear classifier during early training.
 These variance reduction methods can also be combined with momentum (Allen-Zhu, 2017) and preconditioning methods (Moritz et al., 2016) to obtain faster convergence.
 Hence, optimizing our model for the rate-distortion is as simple as minimizing − log p(x | z) + βKL  q(z |x) || p(z) , where β is a scalar hyperparameter controlling the compression rate.
 Intuitively, we would expect functions that generalize well to be smooth—that is, to not have a high amount of rugosity.
 Hash-based method (Tang et al., 2017) counts the hash codes of states.
 To this end, we propose to embed actions’ datasets by extending the work on hierarchical variational autoencoders (Edwards & Storkey, 2017).
In this paper we present a heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimisation scheme capable of both representing and optimising aleatoric noise in the suggestions.
 Classically AdaBoost does not perform well under noisy data compounding errors for each point and progressively creating a worse classifier.
 Although the ability to perform full-state prediction is sufficient for planning in latent space, it is notstrictly necessary.
 In addition, we perform both whitebox and blackbox settings for each attack to evaluate the model vulnerabilities.
 Intuitively, this process is efficient since the agent avoids exploring within the explored region.
 The variational inference also applies in this scenario.
 The two-level task dependency can be used by our framework to improve the performance on multiple tasks.
Further, existing uDA methods do not support distributed domain datasets and assume that source and target data are available on the same machine.
 We find that SQuAD2.0 and NewsQA (Trischler et al., 2017) models can be attacked on a substantial proportion of samples, even with a limited computational adversarial search budget.
In the experimental part of this paper (Section 3) we compare the performance of XD and multilingual tuning for multiple language combinations, in order to cover low and high resource settings as well as related and distant language pairs.
 Consequently, curvature correction only affects the speed of convergence without affecting other qualitative properties of parameter update process.
 To generate semantically meaningful features, we exploit the domain knowledge about ICD codes.
 Regarding recent advances in learning-based schemes, a variety of deep learning models, e.g, (7; 16; 24; 23), have been proposed.
4. What is the number of labeled examples beyond which a conventional approach to training deep neural networks outperforms the meta-learned initializations?
 These works also elucidate two interesting aspects to enable the use of linear scaling in large batch synchronous SGD: (i) linear scaling of learning rate is harmful during the initial phase; thus, a hand-tuned warmup strategy of slowly increasing the learning rate needs to be used initially, and (ii) linear scaling of learning rate can be detrimental beyond a certain batch size.
 The key contribution of our work is progressive filtering, i.g,, ∗Computer Vision Group, University of Freiburg, Germany †Bosch Center for AI, Bosch GmbH, Germany ‡Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germanyleverage the knowledge provided in the network’s output over different training iterations to form a consensus of predictions (self-ensemble predictions) to progressively identify and filter out the noisy labels from the labeled data.
 More importantly, they fail to exploit other important metrics such as syntactic and semantic constraints for guiding high-quality text generation.
 We theoretically motivate the intuitive effectiveness of our method, deriving theoretical guarantees that exploit the theoretical framework provided by Maurer et al., (2016), in which the authors present upper bounds on the quality of learning in MTL when extracting features for multiple tasks in a single shared representation.
 Hence, the assignment of a given node should depend on both the input node features and the assignments of other nodes.
 Node embedding is updated by aggregation from 1-neighboring nodes, which is akin to the convolution operator in CNN.
In this paper, we propose a graph inference learning (GIL) framework to teach the model itself to adaptively infer from reference labeled nodes to those query unlabeled nodes, and finally boost the performance of semi-supervised node classification in the case of a few number of labeled samples.
 The key idea is that, instead of using a learned reward function to provide a reward signal to the agent, we can simply give the agent a constant reward of r = +1 for matching the demonstrated action in a demonstrated state, and a constant reward of r = 0 for all other behavior.
 Furthermore, NODE allows constructing multi-layer architectures, which resembles ”deep” GBDT that is trained end-to-end, which was never proposed before.
 To avoid training error amplification, the temporally average model of each network is proposed to produce reliable soft labels for supervising the other network in a collaborative training strategy.
We tackle these problems by introducing a novel approach that combines three key ideas (section 2 and fig. 1).
 However, this is not a complete answer to this problem, because trading overestimation bias for underestimation bias is not always desirable, as we show in our experiments.
 Our approach preserves data privacy by training one model per source node and updating the target model with the aggregation of source gradients, but does so in a way that reduces domain shift.
We encode the input sequence using a standard Transformer encoder to generate the output sequence with a varying amount of computation in the decoder network.
Beyond the `1 regularizer, plenty of non-convex sparsity measurements have been used in the field of feature selection and compressed sensing (Hurley & Rickard, 2009; Wen et al., 2018).
 To verify this, we experiment with search spaces where we can exhaustively evaluate all architectures, and observe that these algorithms truly cannot discover top-performing architectures.
 It models the negative correlations between samples: the inclusion of a sample reduces the probability of including a similar sample.
 Another commonly used regularization, the `1-norm where r(x) = µ‖x‖1 = µ ∑n j=1 |xj | (the convex surrogate of the `0-norm), would encourage a sparse solution.
 However, as an LM is intrinsically a text generator, we can use it to answer questions while generating pseudo-samples of the previous task to be replayed later.
 To consider sequential decisions, the leader-follower MDP game (Sabbadin & Viet, 2013; 2016) and the RL-based mechanism design (Tang, 2017; Shen et al., 2017) are introduced but most of their works only focus on matrix games or small-scale Markov games, which cannot be applied to the case with the large-scale action or state space.
 The limitation is illustrated inFigure 1.
 However, in vanilla training, since both training and inference are not based on distances in the representation space, they are not optimized to fulfill this goal.
 There are generally two lines of strategies to learn DPPs:Approximation.
 In the meta-learning problem, similarly, we aim at automatically establishing the metaknowledge graph between prior knowledge learned from previous tasks.
We propose Adversarial Variational Inference and Learning (AdVIL) to relieve some headache of learning an MRF model.
 To enable the neural network processors to work with low-precision integer operands and minimize the accuracy losses, a good network quantizer must satisfy the constraints as enlisted in Table 1.
 Then, given the bag level label that whether the image contains metastases or not, the task is to label each pixel as either metastases or normal.
 The task order that the model trains on has a large impact on the individual task performance as well as the final performance, not only because of the model drift coming from the catastrophic forgetting but due to the unidirectional knowledge transfer from earlier tasks to later ones.
 Our proposed variational inference framework is flexible enough to learn the range within which the adaptation parameters can vary.
 The novelty of the attack comes from the explicit use of class-wise and layer-wise feature distributions.
 Instead of developing a high-level methodology without the need of knowing the details of low-level heuristics, we are primarily interested in a closely integrated system that best utilizes the strength of OR operators and learning capability.
 However, it is still difficult for low-power mobile devices such as drones and smart glasses to adopt the layer-wise quantized CNN models.
 These architectures tend to favor wide and shallow cells, where the majority of intermediate nodes are directly connected to the input nodes.
 They can infer the state from the past observations online.
 To learn optimal relative action values, we propose the ranking policy gradient (RPG) that optimizes the actions’ rank with respect to the long-term reward by learning the pairwise relationship among actions.
Our contributions in this paper are the following:
 We believe that the softmax distribution induced by the random transformation contains rich information which is not captured by majority vote that simply counts the final class predictions from the transformed samples.
∗Equal Contribution.
 The revised DNN shuffles feature elements in a layer xrev = Ax and shuffles the feature back in the next convolutional layer x̂ = Wrev · xrev, where Wrev = WA−1; A is a permutation matrix.
 As input, we capture a short video of an object to reconstruct the geometry using multi-view stereo.
 As a common practice, adversarial training refers to the finite-sample empirical version of (1) without access to the underlying distribution D thatmin θ∈Rd Ladv(θ) = min θ∈Rd N∑ i=1 max δi∈∆ `(θ, xi + δ, yi).
 For example, “John J.
 The program memory stores the weights of the MANN’s controller network, which are retrieved quickly via a key-value attention mechanism across timesteps yet updated slowly via backpropagation.
 However, if we can generate a sequence of good subgoals, such as (1) the robot arm grasping the†Work completed at Google Brain Videos and code are available.(2) the open drawer, and (3) the robot arm reaching for the book, planning from the initial state to (1), from (1) to (2), from (2) to (3), and from (3) to the final goal, the problem becomes substantially easier.
 First, the control infrastructures are distributed in a wide region, so collecting global observations in execution increases communication delay and failure rate, and hurts the robustness.
 Specifically, GNNs follow a neighborhood aggregation scheme to recursively aggregate information from neighbors to update node states.
 In contrast, the mixup training method (Zhang et al., 2018) introduces globally linear behavior in-between the data manifolds, which can also improve adversarial robustness (Zhang et al., 2018; Verma et al., 2019a).
 Recent work intends to solve this problem by utilizing extra unlabeled data (Carmon et al., 2019; Stanforth et al., 2019),∗Corresponding author.
 This “additional” information can be seen as a privileged input because it requires the agent to do something extra to obtain it.
 On the other hand, irreversibility implies that states with a larger number of broken vases tend to occur in the future, and one should therefore expect an arrow of time (as a scalar function of the state) to assign larger valuesto states with larger number of broken vases.
 We frame the solution as learning the function f : X × T → Y that can accurately predict the outcomes (both observed ŷiti as well as counterfactuals ŷi¬ti) given the context information xi for each individual.
Discontinuity and Mode Collapse/Mixture It is a common practice among GAN/VAE models that the generators/decoders are expressed by deep neural networks, which can only represent continuous mappings.
 Given a triple i, j, k we first form the product pil1j l 2 k in the Clifford algebra, and then extract a scalar quantity η(pil 1 j l 2 k) using a natural continuous function η : Cl(H) −→ R associated to the Z-grading of Cl(H).
 However, a demonstration can significantly narrow down the search space while also providing a practical means for a user to communicate the goal, enabling the agent to achieve few-shot learning of behavior.
We select 20 out of 100 randomly sampled video clips from the Berkeley Deep Drive dataset for evaluation.
 It has been shown that DNNs tend to learn simple patterns first before fitting label noise (Arpit et al., 2017).
 In addition, the sample complexity of adversarial training can be significantly higher than that of natural training, that is, training robust DNNs tends to require more data either labeled (Schmidt et al., 2018) or unlabeled ones (Uesato et al., 2019; Carmon et al., 2019; Najafi et al., 2019; Zhai et al., 2019).
 Most importantly, the neural network is supposed to be trained using the original data without additional human supervision, and is efficient to conduct inference.
 We note that a similar lack of acceleration for the stochastic Heavy Ball method was analyzed in (9).
 Hence, while selfsupervised learning works well for these layers, this may be due more to the limited complexity of such features than the strength of the supervisory technique.
Other forms of inductive biases such as relying on temporal information (video data) (Denton & Birodkar, 2017; Yingzhen & Mandt, 2018), allowing for interaction with the environment (Thomas et al., 2017), or incorporating grouping information (Kulkarni et al., 2015; Bouchacourt et al., 2018) were discussed in the literature as candidates to circumvent the impossibility result by Locatello et al., (2019b).
 Applied to a whole layer, with potentially different scaling factors arranged into a diagonal matrix M, this can be written asWl ←MWl, bl ←Mbl,(3) Wl+1 ←Wl+1M−1.
 For instance, whentrained on CIFAR10, generative models report higher likelihoods for SVHN than for CIFAR10 itself (fig.  1; data descriptions are available in Appendix A).
 Take, for instance, the problem of graph classification.
 3In the literature, IDA is sometimes referred to as incremental, continual, or lifelong learning.
 This approach may not always be practical, though, since many difficult, but otherwise irrelevant tasks might “distract” exploration objectives.
 Yang Liu initiated the transformer models study, perceived and performed the study of attention identifiability and effective attention, i.g,, Section 3 and Appendix A, and contributed to the token attribution discussions and calculations.
 From left to right, we show how candidate trajectories are updated, across different planning iterations within one time-step.
 We also learn a dynamical model by standard supervised learning so that we compute actions by maximizing the values of the predicted next states.
 We significantly close this gap through the following contributions:
 The new update is computed as the current update minus a step in the direction of the momentum.
Critically, we find the adversaries win by creating natural observations that are adversarial, and not by becoming generally strong opponents.
 Furthermore, stability should not come at odds with sensitivity.
 Specifically, we replace entity mentions in the original documents with names of other entities of the same type and train the models to distinguish the correct entity mention from randomly chosen ones.
∗Equal contributionWhile being simple, this approach is not robust to minor changes in the input.
 This incorporates a new set of previously unexplored features for prefetching and branch prediction, and we demonstrate that these can be leveraged to obtain significant performance improvements.
 We designed a special search space capable of supporting optimization over multiple branches of different resolutions, instead of a single backbone.
 The discriminator network is trained to determine whether the inputs belong to the real dataset or fake dataset created by the generator.
 However, their algorithms are limited for stochastic AUC maximization with a deep neural network due to three reasons.
In this work, we propose an attack-free and scalable method to train robust deep neural networks.
 Specifically, we reconstruct a given input from the pose parameters of the winning capsule and then detect adversarial examples by comparing the difference between the reconstruction distributions for natural and adversarial (or otherwise corrupted) images.
 The robustness could be further explained by the fact that AAT objective presents a minimax problem that supports the learning of class conditional distributions.
 Perfectly-estimated belief states can thus be taken as “observations” of an RL agent that contains complete information for solving the task.
 The chief also enforces that the N policies are spread in the policy space with a given distance from the previous best policy point so that the search area by allN learners maintains a wide area and does not collapse into a narrow region.
 Their experiments show that highly compositional languages may indeed emerge through iterated learning.
 P-RGF (Cheng et al., 2019) used the gradient information from the source model to accelerate searching process.
In order to reliably measure the progress in image classification and to fairly test the generalizability of existing classifiers in a natural setting, we believe that it is necessary to compare the classifiers on a much larger image collection in the order of millions or even billions.
 We observe that mixout(wpre) reduces the number of unusable models that fail with the chance-level accuracy and increases the average development (dev) scores for all tasks.
Without a simulator, there is a dichotomy between finite-horizon and infinite-horizon settings.
 As a result, there is no indication that these operators compute optimal sparse `1 codes.
 Our main idea is to treat neurons of a neural network as inputs in a coreset framework.
 For example, Zhou & Liang (2018) prove that one-hidden-layer neural networks with two nodes in the hidden layer and two-piece linear (ReLU-like) activations have spurious local minima; Swirszcz et al., (2016) prove that ReLU networks have spurious local minima under the squared loss when most of the neurons are not activated; Safran & Shamir (2018) present a computer-assisted proof that two-layer ReLU networks have spurious local minima; a recent work (Yun et al., 2019b) have proven that neural networks with two-piece linear activations have infinite spurious local minima, but the results only apply to the networks with one hidden layer and one-dimensional outputs; and a concurrent work (Goldblum et al., 2020) proves that for multi-layer perceptrons of any depth, the performance of every local minimum on the training data equals to a linear model, which is also verified by experiments.
 Waiting for these straggler workers certainly decreases the number of SGD iterations per unit of time and leads less optimal usage of available computational resources.
 Recently, Zambaldi et al., (2019) proposed the relational deep RL to learn environmental entities relations.
Each network addresses a computational problem not previously fully met, together paving the way for the generation of video games with realistic graphics.
 By embedding the filtering into training, we propose a new robust training scheme termed learning with ensemble consensus (LEC).
 Specifically, we denote by pi the probability that the base classifier f predicts label i for the Gaussian random variable N (x, σ2I).
 Incentives to explore unvisited states rely therefore on the generalisation of the neural network.
 This work is done when Weijie Su and Xizhou Zhu are interns at Microsoft Research Asia.
 As shown in Figure 1(c), it augments the convolutions with free-form sampling grids in the data space.
 One solution to speed up inference is to distill an ensemble of models into a single network to yield the mean predictions of the ensemble (Hinton et al., 2015; Korattikara Balan et al., 2015).
 1An environment of computation nodes who are not specifically optimized to work togetheroften based on older parameters and therefore are inaccurate.
 He et al., (2016) impose a triangle inequality constraint in RL via an online, algorithmic penalty.
 Critically, our functional approximation of the error depends on bothmodel and data sizes.
reinforcement learning (e.g, (Misra et al., 2018)).
We address this issue by developing a novel neural architecture, Continuous Logic Network (CLN), which is able to efficiently learn explicit and precise representations of SMT formulas by using continuous truth values.
 The methods used are DARTS, StacNAS, PDARTS, MANAS, CNAS, NSGANET, ENAS and NAO.
 Nevertheless, these resolution-preserving blocks are not guaranteed to preserve all the relevant information, and they greatly increase the memory consumption and computational cost of the models.
 Between two classes θi and θj , there are three possibilities: θi > θj or θi < θj or neither (i.g, incomparable).
 Human minds need extensive training and practice to get used to complex reasoning, and it will take immense efforts for crowdsourcing workers to design such logical reasoning questions.
 Specifically, this is done by utilizing the learned connection weights to guide evolution, in addition to randomly combining, splitting, or connecting sub-network blocks.
To incorporate these specifications, we propose a regularization method that is based on a selection mechanism that creates a fictive data point by explicitly perturbing an observed true data point.
 Lastly, even after a satisfactory convergence of the objective, the learned aggregated posterior distribution rarely matches the assumed latent prior in practice (Kingma et al., 2016; Bauer & Mnih, 2019; Dai & Wipf, 2019), ultimately hurting the quality of generated samples.
 Furthermore, appropriate computation allocation across spacial position (Dai et al., 2017) boost the performance of detector by affecting the ERF.
 This allows us to probe the agent’s behavior in novel states created by an optimization scheme to induce specificactions in the agent.
 Moreover, the evaluation code is sometimes missing or incomplete, and experiments are not standardized across different works in terms of node and edge features.
∗Authors are ordered alphabetically.
While the theoretical behavior of Adam in convex cases becomes clear, it remains an open problem whether strong convexity can be exploited to achieve better performance.
 Our main contributions are as follows:
 With this set of prototype graphs for each base class label, we cluster the spectral measures associated with each prototype graph in Wasserstein space to create a super-class label.
 Therefore, BC often suffers from poor generalization.
 To the best of our knowledge, these assumptions are more general than those used in any previously proposed attack models, which renders the old models ineffective.
 Both components, along with the context encoder, are independent with the extra knowledge, and thus can be pre-trained using the ungrounded dialogues.
 Second, we perform an upward cumulative-average operation on each target node, which accumulates all elements in the branches originating from the target node to its descendant leaves.
 In particular, most existing work considers the continuous-time setting, which requires solving a pair of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck (FP) equations, whereas the discrete-time setting is more common in practice, e.g, in the aforementioned applications.
verification tasks are separated, a wide set of properties can be checked.
 In practice, it is necessary to introduce several additional penalties to the loss function in order for training to be effective.
More specifically, our contributions are:
 This suggests new directions in ongoing efforts to revisit the standard rate-distortion paradigm (Blau & Michaeli, 2019).
 Thus, to reduce such variance, it is better to use smaller learning rates in the first few epochs of training, which justifies the warmup heuristic.
 Finally, we can use DDL in a fully unsupervised method, where the most distant states are selected for exploration, resulting in an unsupervised reinforcement learning procedure that discovers difficult skills that reach dynamically distant states from a given start state.
 Therefore it is plausible that a meta-learner trained with one k value can be suboptimal at adapting to tasks with a different k value and thus exhibit meta-overfitting to k.
In this paper, we propose a stochastic model, BasisGAN, that directly maps an input condition to diverse output images, aiming at building networks that model the multi-mode intrinsically.
We hypothesize that these limits are due to biases in the distribution of images on which the GAN is trained.
 Although label acquisition for semantic segmentation is more costly and time consuming than image classification, there has been considerably less work in active learning for semantic segmentation (Dutt Jain & Grauman, 2016; Mackowiak et al., 2018; Vezhnevets et al., 2012; Konyushkova et al., 2015; Gorriz et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017), and they focus on hand-crafted strategies.
Related Work.
 Such semi-supervised classifiers typically assume that similar points are likely to be of the same class, this is known as the cluster assumption (Zhu, 2005; Chapelle et al., 2009).
 We make the underlying assumption that the network architecture is constant throughout training, though it may be interesting to entertain changes in architecture during training (Rusu et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017).
In a similar vein, in this work, we propose to learn high dimensional embeddings that are sparse and hence efficient to retrieve using sparse matrix multiplication operations.
 Hence, there is no guarantee of such obtained solutions to be close to the fixed point of TD learning.
 However, these methods do so by altering the original divergence minimization objective to measure a divergence between the target expert distribution and the replay buffer distribution.
 Let mi be the alllayer margin for the i-th example.
 The second issue means that during sequence generation, any imperfection in next token prediction leads to error accumulation that is not addressed by likelihood training.
 Further, we provide demonstrations that it is possible to transfer controllability to speakers for whom we have no labels.
In contrast, our method leverages the pathology that makes these methods struggle (an ill-conditioned Hessian).
 It can also be challenging to detect this tampering, as in the case of a backdoor attack2, since a backdoored model will behave like a regular model in the absence of the embedded trigger.
 As such, in parameter-transfer methods, the meta-learner or any downstream participant can potentially recover data from a previous task.
 2) Measure only within-dataset generalization.
The retrieval phase is critical.
Our goal is to devise an algorithm that combines the advantages of MBRL and IL by offering MBRL’s flexibility to achieve new tasks at test-time and IL’s potential to learn desirable behavior entirely from offline data.
 In contrast to hierarchical learning where sub-goals are selected sequentially in time (Sutton et al., 1999), all agents act toward their goals simultaneously in Stage 2 of our curriculum.
 Neural networks can be made to generalize automatically across noise levels through a simple modification in the architecture: removing all additive constants.
 Although their algorithm converges quickly, it still requires large number of queries (e.g, 20,000) for attacking a single image since every function evaluation of Cheng’s formulation has to be computed using binary search requiring tens of queries.
 We tackle this challenge from two fronts with the following contributions:
 Here, we provide computational evidence for the latter possibility and demonstrate that the orientation-tilt illusion reflects neural strategies optimized for object contour detection.
 We believe that ZFS will provide researchers with a better experimental framework to understand which principles are important for Zero-Shot generalization.

 It then computes a sparse update to increase the precision of those important output features.
 We introduce neural modules to perform reasoning over text using distributed representations, and perform symbolic reasoning, such as arithmetic, sorting, comparisons, and counting (§3).
 To this end, as shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(c), we develop VHE-raster-scan-GAN to perform image generation in not only a multi-scale low-to-high-resolution manner in each layer, as done by StackGAN++, but also a hierarchical-semantic coarse-to-fine fashion across layers, a unique feature distinguishing it from existing methods.
To this end, we propose a novel Transferable Neural Architecture Search (T-NAS) method (the bottom of Figure 1).
 In order to reduce the size of this space while maintaining expressiveness, Hausknecht et al., (2019a) propose the use of template-actions in which the agent first selects a template (e.g, put in ) then fills in the blanks using vocabulary words.

 In contrast, the model compression literature broadly adopts a two-step approach: learning a large CNN first, then compressing the model by various model compression techniques such as pruning, quantization and coding (Han et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2017), or low-rank and sparse representation of filters (Ioannou et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2017).
 Thus, there is a need for a framework which can utilize KG embedding techniques for learning task-specific node and relation embeddings.
 To adapt the acyclicity constraint to our nonlinear model, we use an argument similar to what is used in Zheng et al., (2018) and apply it first at the level of neural network paths and then at the level of graph paths.

 A key property of CTRNN is that the time-constant τ together with the first term −g(t), is in effect a low-pass filter with bandwidth ατ−1 suppressing high frequency components of the activation signal, φ((Ug(s)) + (Wx(s)) + b).
 However, instance-level normalization hardly meet industrial or commercial needs so far, for this type of methods have to compute instance-level statistics both in training and inference, which will introduce additional nonlinear operations in inference procedure and dramatically increase consumption Shao et al., (2019).
 During sleep, there is reactivation of neurons involved in previously learned activity (Stickgold (2005)) and this reactivation is likely to invoke the same spatio-temporal pattern of neuronal firing as the pattern observed during training in the awake state (Wilson & McNaughton, 1994).
 They assumed whitened data and showed that GD can converge to the global minimum if (i) the training loss at the initialization is very close to optimal or (ii) the regression matrix Φ is symmetric and positive definite.

To address these problems, we propose a multivariate spatial point process model with a nonparametric intensity.
Given such a type dependency graph, our approach uses a GNN to compute a vector embedding for each type variable and then performs type prediction using a pointer-network-like architecture (Vinyals et al., 2015).
 The raw signals such as speech, however, cannot be taken directly from the embedding look-up table, so an encoder module is required.

 Thus, explaining the latent space of generative models through the lens of factors of variation is promising.
The main contribution of this work is two-fold.
 However, the computational complexity of these recovery methods are quasi-polynomial, thus again resulting in large computational expense.
 If a different stream of data also observes the events of interest, we can use this second modality to provide self-supervising1The utility meter outputs the sum of the energy of all active appliances in a house as a function of time.
Above, fW0 does not depend on W, and f (1) corresponds to the NTK model, which is the dominant W-dependent term when {wr} are small and leads to the coupling between the gradient dynamics for training neural net and its NTK f (1).
 Jin et al., (2017) use deep reinforcement learning to solve regret minimization problem for single-agent settings, which is different from two-player perfect-recall IIGs.
To put our results in the context of past work, we also use word retrieval to compare our finetuning procedure to two alternatives: (1) fastText augmented with sentence and aligned using rotations (Bojanowski et al., 2017; Rücklé et al., 2018; Artetxe et al., 2018), and (2) BERT aligned using rotations (Aldarmaki & Diab, 2019; Schuster et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019).
 These steps are similar to those used in Oracle Guided Inductive Synthesis (Jha et al., 2010) with two main differences: (i) we automate the entire process by learning the oracle from data instead of using a human oracle, and (ii) as we do not use a human oracle to produce a correct output, we need to ensure that the set of candidate outputs contains the correct one.
 The positive is sampled among the data with the same label with the anchor but in different leaf nodes of the decision trees, and the negative is from the data in the same leaf nodes with the anchor.
 • Fine-tuning from similar domains and tasks works better (Ge & Yu, 2017; Cui et al., 2018;Achille et al., 2019; Ngiam et al., 2018).
 JY helped with the annotation pipeline, finding bugs, navigating model and experimental directions, engineering workable gradients, and posing the model mathematically.
 Rezende et al., (2016) proposed unsupervised single-view 3D mesh reconstruction, but it can only be applied to a primitive dataset.
 IBP can be applied at test time to arbitrary model inputs to verify whether or not they are undersensitive; but it can also be used to derive a new auxiliary training objective that leads to models verifiably adhering to this specification, and which we find generalises to held-out test data.
 In our proposed approach, Jacobian Adversarially Regularized Networks (JARN), the classifier learns to produce salient Jacobians with a regularization objective to fool a discriminator network into classifying them as input images.
 Indeed, with a small twist of performing fine-tuning transductively, this baseline outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms on all standard benchmarks and few-shot protocols (cf. Table 1).
 To achieve this, in this paper we leverage the family of contrastive objectives (Gutmann & Hyvärinen, 2010; Oord et al., 2018; Arora et al., 2019; Hjelm et al., 2018).
 In fact, symbolic superoptimization should have been a task that naturally keeps human outside the loop, because it directly operates on machine code, whose consumers and evaluators are machines, not humans.
 Then, the augmentation policy network is taken as an adversary to explore the weakness of the target network.
 That is, we can explicitly learn to perturb the training instances to obtain low test loss in this meta-learningframework.
 This definition might not be desirable when the base ground-truth outcome of the two groups are completely different.
 A major challenge in practice, e.g, for single-cell RNA-seq, is that we and experts do not know what cost is appropriate.
 We could turn to neural architecture search (NAS) techniques (Zoph & Le, 2017; Zoph et al., 2018; Pham et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019a) but these introduce a gigantic computational overhead; even one of the fastest such approaches (Pham et al., 2018) still requires half a day of search time on a GPU.
Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015) show that our methods attack both normally trained models and adversarially trained models with higher attack success rates than existing baseline attacks.
 In this work, we do not need to distinguish between theoretically vs empirically motivated measures, and simply refer to both as complexity measures.
 To compute such bounds efficiently, we adopt the linear-relaxation framework (Weng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018) – we recursively propagate and compute linear lower and upper bounds for each neuron w.r.t the input within the perturbation space S.
Theorem 1.(i) PointNet is not equivariant universal.
 However, as the updates (eq. (2)) are different from the mini-batch updates (eq. (1)) for any H ¡ 1, the generalization behavior (test error) of both algorithms is expected to be different.
The idea behind the cycle consistency condition from (Zhu et al., 2017) is to enforce additional constraints by introducing another function F : Y → X, which is also approximated by a neural network and tries to solve the inverse task: for each y ∈ Y find F (y) ∈ X that would be the best translation of y to X .
 Intuitively, the combination of the leader update and the correction term is parallel to the ridge in the landscape (see fig.  1), hence the name Follow-the-Ridge.
 Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) (Jacobs et al., 1991), our model consists of a set of experts, each of which is in charge of a subset of the data in a stream.
 One peculiar feature of knowledge graphs is that they usually rely on the open world assumption (facts not present are not necessarily false, they are simply unknown).
In addition, we theoretically analyze the existence of VSP under several circumstances and propose a simple yet effective means to suppress VSP while retaining the intuitive advantages of zero imputation: normalizing with the number of non-zero entries for each data instance.
Both of the above two issues can be alleviated, using the proposed method, DropEdge.
 While the attention map in the generator induces the focus on areas that specifically distinguish between the two domains, the attention map in the discriminator helps fine-tuning by focusing on the difference between real image and fake image in target domain.
 For example, gating can allow us to identify input patterns that trigger the response of a single unit in the network.
 This enables end-to-end training of both the subsampling scheme and the downstream model.
 This motivates us to apply differential privacy to anomaly detection and defense against backdoor attacks.
 In Mirhoseini et al., (2017; 2018), learning is done from scratch for each computation graph and for placement decisions only, requiring hours (e.g, 12 to 27 hours per graph).
 This motivates use of learning in a modular and hierarchical fashion inside of what one may call a ‘classical navigation pipeline’.
 Recently, it has also been suggested that ensembles may help boost the robustness of DNNs (Strauss et al., (2017); Pang et al., (2019); He et al., (2017); Tramèr et al., (2017)).
 However, their practical implementations are limited to either discrete groups (that leave the grid intact) or continuous, (locally) compact, unimodular groups such as roto-translations (that enable the use of Fourier theory).
 Therefore, we begin by investigating the contribution of word-piece overlap – the extent to which the same word-pieces appear in both source and target languages – and distinguish it from other similarities, which we group into a structural similarity between the source and target languages.
 However, these models cannot represent complex objects and background segments that have too flexible morphology to be captured by spatial attention (i.g, based on rectangular bounding boxes).

to be used to determine the stabilizing properties of the learned controller when implemented in closed-loop.
 However, when investigating the scaling of decentralized algorithms to larger number of nodes we observe that (all) decentralized schemes encounter difficulties and often do not reach the same (test and train) performance as centralized schemes.
 However, the vulnerability of RL agents can not be easily discovered by existing baselines which are model-free and build upon random searches and heuristics – this is also verified by our extensive experiments on various domains (e.g, walker, humanoid, cartpole, and fish), where the agents still achieve close to their original best rewards even with baseline attacks at every time step.
 Thus, the question of how self-attention layers actually process images remains open.
 We call EMP a partially policy-agnostic method in the sense that, EMP does not require any information on each“physical” behavior policy, instead, it utilizes some aggregated information of the behavior policies learned from data.
 To do that, we perform meta-learning in a rich, combinatorial, open-ended space of programs.
 Generalizing between different initial conditions is known to be difficult (Ghosh et al., 2017; Langlois et al., 2019; Zolna et al., 2019).
Due to the hierarchical structure of the data, it is natural to formulate meta-learning by a hierarchical Bayes (HB) model (Good, 1980; Berger, 1985), or alternatively, an empirical Bayes (EB) model (Robbins, 1985; Kucukelbir & Blei, 2014).
 Thus, if the class-conditional generative model has high accuracy, rejection of outliers from the wrong class via likelihood may be possible.
In this work, we deal with the class-supervised disentanglement task.
 The resulting latent space is a “non-constantly” curved manifold that is more flexible than a single constant curvature manifold.
 This allows a graceful fallback to PPO when the model is not effective.
 One popular technique that is adopted by many black-box attacks (Chen et al., 2017; Alzantot et al., 2018; Tu et al., 2018) to significantly improve the query efficiency is to search for adversarial perturbations in a low-dimensional latent space (search dimensionality reduction).
 When the subtask dependencies are complex and reward is sparse, learning an optimal policy can require a large number of interactions with the environment.
 The second metric normalizes the reconstruction errors before summing up.
 We are specifically interested in uncovering the intrinsic connections between a point cloud learning problem and a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) problem.
 We augment model pre-training with two new structural objectives on the inner-sentence and inter-sentence structures, respectively.
 However, unlike prior work, we compute the scaling factors in a data-driven manner based on the real-valued activations of each layer prior to binarization, which results in superior performance.
 Usually, learning is set at a specific β.
 Specifically, the searched building block in a supernet should be as small as possible to generate the most diversified model structures.
 Exact computation is only tractable for discrete variables, or for a limited family of problems where the probability distributions are known.
 LSRA trades off the computation in FFN for wider attention layers.
 (Infinite width networks of this sort have been studied from various perspectives by e.g, Bengio et al., (2006); Neyshabur et al., (2015); Bach (2017); Mei et al., (2018)).
 In this work, we focus on applying ALR to Wasserstein GANs, as regularizing or constraining Lipschitz continuity has proven to have a high impact on training stability and reducing mode collapse.
 Table 1 and Figure 3 show the performance of state-of-the-art approaches (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017a; Aljundi et al., 2018) when tested∗Corresponding author: yuanpeng16@gmail.
 Note that neither BC-based methods nor GAIL-based IRL methods have learned to handle dynamics misalignment and deviation correction.
 For example, airplanes, cars, and swivel chairs all have wheels, even though their global geometries are totally different.
∗ indicates equal contributions.
 These regularization methods and spectral normalization are motivated by controlling Lipschitz constant of the discriminator.
 In this way, the analysis provides another perspective on the scaling behavior and small weight changes of the NTK.
 Considering the complexity of typical natural scenes as well as the importance of scalable unsupervised object perception for applications such as self-driving systems, it is thus a challenge of the highest priority to scale robustly to scenes with a large number of objects.
 However, in line with previous works (Tramèr et al., 2016; Orekondy et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2018), we find models can be effectively stolen using just the top-1 predicted label returned by the black-box.
 Assigning to each domain its own set of gates allows the global network to learn what set ofcomputations should be carried out for each one.
 With this loss, we represent uncertain orientations by modeling uncertainty over unit quaternions.
 Take, for instance, translation and rotation.
 The authors applied a per-tensor quantization and used the dynamic range as an additional trainable parameter also learned with gradient descent.
A useful adversarial model should require only little overhead to be fitted to the data, and it needs to be able to generate negative samples quickly in order to enable inexpensive gradient updates.
 Our mapping between search space representations is novel to the best of our knowledge and it allows querying the performance of found architectures from one-shot NAS methods, contrary to what is claimed by Ying et al., (2019).
 More broadly, a category of approaches, known as Bayesian Neural Networks (Blundell et al., 2015; Welling & Teh, 2011; Neal, 1996), maintains a distribution over the weights of the neural network.
 For deep neural networks, numerous complexity measures have been proposed to capture the generalization behavior such as VC dimension (Harvey et al., 2017) and norm-based capacity including spectral norm (Bartlett et al., 2017; Neyshabur et al., 2019), Frobenius norm (Neyshabur et al., 2015b;a; 2018) and lp-path norm(Neyshabur et al., 2015b; Bartlett & Mendelson, 2002; Golowich et al., 2018).
 Unlike prior stealing attacks, these attacks do not require physical proximity to the hardare that runs the system (Batina et al., 2019; Hua et al., 2018) or direct query access to train an approximate model (Tramèr et al., 2016).
 In spike-based backpropagation methods, the non-differentiability of the spiking neuron is handled by either approximating the spiking neuron model as continuous and differentiable (Huh & Sejnowski, 2018) or by defining a surrogate gradient as a continuous approximation of the real gradient (Wu et al., 2018; Bellec et al., 2018; Neftci et al., 2019).
 We propose two variants, Hard MMA (MMA-H) and Infinite Lookback MMA (MMA-IL).
To evaluate our method, we focus on visual representation learning in this paper, although our model can be easily modified for natural language or speech data.
Moreover, by determining the importance of neurons, unimportant ones can further be removed from computation during inference with network pruning methods (Luo et al., 2017; He et al., 2017; Zhuang et al., 2018; Ye et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2019).
 The core idea behind deep learning-based sparse coding is to train DNNs to approximate the optimal sparse code.
 We prove that under certain conditions, the dynamics exponentially approaches a subspace that is invariant under the dynamics.
Coming up with methods that are able to learn unsupervised representations of an entire graph, as opposed to nodes, is an important step in working with unlabeled or partially labeled graphs Narayanan et al., (2017); Hu et al., (2019); Nguyen et al., (2017).
 At each of the last 3 skip connections and residual modules of ResNet-18, we illustrate the success rate of attacks crafted using gradients backpropagate through either the skip connection or the residual module in Figure 1.
 A simple and effective attention layer is then designed to fuse the image representations and the original source sentence representations as input to the decoder for predicting target translations.
 In many cases, this assumption may not be realistic.
 The idea of selective synaptic plasticity is to partially preserve synapses that are critical for previously learned tasks by rigidifying those synapses (i.g,, to enforce critical synapses to change less).
 However, whether it is possible to simultaneously guarantee equalized odds and accuracy parity remains an open question.
Turnover-based strategies (e.g, Hausman et al., (1976), Yu & De Koster (2009)) assign locations so that the travel distance is inversely proportional to the turnover of the product.
 This does not imply, however, that AC-GNNs can capture every node classifier—that is, a function assigning true or false to every node—that is refined by the WL test.
 We include a more detailed discussion in Sec.2.
Contributions Here we investigate the function of horizontal vs. top-down connections during perceptual grouping.
 Our network deconvolution attempts to remove both correlations in the data at every layer of a network.
 Other work focuses on directly designing unsupervised training objectives by incorporating intuitive loss terms (e.g, backtranslation loss), and demonstrates state-ofthe-art performance on unsupervised machine translation (Lample et al., 2018; Artetxe et al., 2019) and style transfer (Lample et al., 2019).
 Furthermore, the learned skills in these single-agent RL settings are inherently bounded by the task description; once the agent has learned to solve the task, there is little room to improve.
 To extend these two benchmarks and towards better reproducibility of NAS methods1, we propose NAS-Bench-201 with a fixed cell search space, inspired from the search space used in the most popular neural cell-based searching algorithms (Zoph et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019).
 Here, we focus on pre-training as an approach to transfer learning in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Hamilton et al., 2017a; Ying et al., 2018b; Xu et al., 2019; 2018) for graph-level property prediction.
 Our sequential model can keep track of prior and posterior distribution over knowledge, which are sequentially updated considering the responses in previous turns, and thus we can better predict the knowledge by sampling from the posterior.
Following recent approaches (Swersky et al., 2013; Feurer et al., 2018; Wistuba et al., 2018), we argue that it is beneficial to perform transfer learning for global black-box optimization in the framework of BO to retain the proven generalization capabilities of its underlying GP surrogate model.
 Our examples below are from the text domain because rules have been traditionally used in many NLP tasks, but our learning algorithm is agnostic to how rules are expressed.
 Additionally, we show that the distance and angle can be jointly represented in a principled and effective manner by using spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics.
 Wei & Ma (2019) improved this issue by involving a data dependent Lipschitz constant as performed in Arora et al., (2018); Nagarajan & Kolter (2019).
 Unless the learning rate is significantly decreased, we can see a generalization gap: a deterioration in the generalization of A-SGD (with delay τ = 32) from the baseline (S-SGD, τ = 0) value near the steady state — i.g,, after we are near full convergence, following many training epochs (2000).
 The flow is called incompressible in reference to fluid dynamics, since it preserves volumes: the Jacobian determinant is simply unity.
 Most existing classes of structured matrices—such as the class of low-rank matrices—fail to tightly capture other important types of structure.
 Through a range of experiments on different DNNs and datasets, we observe the consistent existence of EB tickets, the cheap costs needed to reliably draw them, and develop a novel mask distance metric to detect their emergence.
 Yet for neural networks, it is not at all clear which form of `2-regularization is optimal.
 In §2, we provide an overview of representation learning with mutual information maximization.
 In those cases, MPNNs may map non-isomorphic graphs to the same feature representations, which is obviously not desirable for graph representation learning.
 The off-line setting is indeed more challenging than its more traditional on-line counterpart, given that one must infer an asymptotic quantity from finite data.
 Waiting for all the devices’ response is obviously infeasible; it is thus impractical to require all the devices be active.
 The quality of a branching strategy is even more important when NN verification problems are considered, which generally have a very large search space.
 As we demonstrate in Sections 3 and 4, more than 40 out of 57 Atari games and all 4 control tasks exhibit low-rank Q matrices.
 Concretely, we find that these optimizations are in fact essential1Note that these code-level optimizations are separate from “implementation choices” like the choice of Pytorch versus TensorFlow in that they intentionally change the training algorithm’s operation.
 3) task-dependent modulator for initial model parameter, which modifies the shared initialization for each task, such that each task can decide how much and what to use from the shared initial model parameter and what to ignore based on its set representation.
 With this assumption, dynamic programming (DP) based algorithms can iteratively find the optimal structure for subsequences and thus consider an enormous number of structures in time O(L3).
• Since the depth dff of intermediate feed-forward layers is often much larger than the depth dmodel of attention activations, it accounts for a large fraction of memory use.
 This problem is particularly challenging in domains where patterns are high-dimensional as in GOL.
 We can thus guarantee that the tree is not necessary for predicting the correct class.
Briefly, the mechanism of creating deeper capsules from a set of shallower capsules is as follows.
 (ii) NPs operate on partially observed context sets whereas ∗Authors contributed equally.
 Unfortunately, the method only works with simple architectures (e.g, fully connected feedforward networks).
 We adopt the sparse terminal reward setting because in most of the tasks, step-by-step rewards are hard to obtain while final evaluations for trajectories are relatively easy.
Our contributions:
 The advantage of this method is that convergence rate does not depend on n; however, it queries more samples to the desired point.
 For instance, Zhang et al., (2018) showed an equivalency between the family of DNNs with piecewise linear activations and integer weight matrices and the family of tropical rational maps, i.g,ratio between two multi-variate polynomials in tropical algebra.
 The model performs an inverse projection of CNN feature vectors in order to map and store observations in an egocentric (bird’s eye view) spatially structured memory.
 The alignment ensures that the adversarial examples reflect the unbiased semantics of the inputs.
 A semantically abnormal example means the input is semantically unrelated to its label, which may come from corrupted input or label.
 Data augmentation, that is synthetically expanding a data set by apply-ing transformations on the available examples, has been long used in machine learning (Simard et al., 1992) and identified as a critical component of many recent successful models, like AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), All-CNN (Springenberg et al., 2014) or ResNet (He et al., 2016), among others.
Algorithm 1 FouST Gradient Estimator Require: Parameters θ ∈ RK , Bernoulli Representation {−a, a}, Interval Parameter b ∈ 0, a,Constant scaling parameter γ 1: Sample xi ∼ pθi(xi), i = 1, ...,K .
 Our solution is to let the nodes at the first and third layers share the same projection vector, and do so for the second and fourth layers.
 Furthermore, GMLP leverages feature groups limiting network connections to local group-wise connections and builds a feature hierarchy via merging groups as the network grows in depth.
 However, the overall prediction performance and fidelity metrics are not reaching desired levels in many cases (Alvarez-Melis & Jaakkola, 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Ribeiro et al., 2018; Lakkaraju et al., 2017).
 Finally, it enables new possibilities for constructing very large-scale training datasets in a much cheaper way, e.g, by searching the Internet using the labels and filtering away less valuable data.
 In this work, we first revisit anddemonstrate the impact of different initialization strategies on style transfer, and inspired by this, design our SST for higher quality domain-specific style transfer.
 (c) At training phase, anchor-methods rely on the intersection-over-union (IoU) to define the positive/negative samples, which introduces additional computation and hyper-parameters for an object detection system (Wang et al., 2019).
 To trade-off efficiency and performance, their topologies are handdesigned stacked patterns and constrained in limited searching spaces.
Minimax formulation (1) naturally provides us with a unified perspective on prior works of adversarial training.
 Many assumptions or priors that are true for images no longer hold for audio.
 As shown in fig.  1(b), class prototypes are expected to remedy the negative effects of inaccurate probabilistic predictions.
 In this way, the agent should be able to learn a diverse set of skills.
 The observed user behavior reflects intrinsic preferences of users, while the recommended items represent the potential user preferences estimated by the model.
 Using a simple path counting argument, we show that H(t) is a sum of m i.i.d. terms where m is dictated by the width of the network.
 It can also arise from the fact that augmentation forces the DNN to have the same prediction for two vastly different versions of the same input, noise-free and a substantially corrupted version.
 Such algorithms often try to minimize the exact (or upper bound) of the worst adversarial loss over all possible bounded energy (often measured in `∞ norm) perturbation around a given input.
In one line of research, Bowers et al., (2014; 2016) assessed the selectivity of single hidden units in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) designed to model human short-term memory.
 In order to solve the issue of the non-differential problems of spikes, (Lee et al., 2016) proposed an alternate that treats membrane potential as differential signals and directly uses BP algorithm to train deep SNNs.
 An exuberant series of recent works prove that feed-forward ReLU networks converge to zero training error when trained with gradient descent from random initialization.
 Instead of learning self-attention over neighborhoods of nodes, we exploit the bi-attention between representations of two nodes that co-occur in a short random-walk (which we call a positive pair).
 Second, based on the precise definition, we generalize the FALCON to design rank-k FALCON, which further improves accuracy while sacrificing a bit of compression and computation reduction rates.
 Unfortunately, the signal-to-noise ratio of the IWAE φ-gradient vanishes as K grows (Rainforth et al., 2018).
 However, previous runtime approaches trade storage cost off dynamic flex-ibility of pruning.
 In our approach, the confidence map is generated by an auxiliary (CNN) network, which is trained using the proposed auxiliary loss function.
However, as an emerging domain, alternating minimization for deep model optimization suffers from a number of unsolved challenges including:
 Pix2pixHD Wang et al., (2018b) and CRN Chen & Koltun (2017) are using a perceptual loss as well for training their networks, e.g, VGGnet Simonyan & Zisserman (2014).
 They can be divided into those that employ the single decoder architecture (e.g, DCGAN and StyleGAN (Radford et al., 2016; Karras et al., 2019)) and those that encode and decode the intermediate representations in several and progressive stages (e.g, StackGAN and progressive GAN (Zhang et al., 2017; Karras et al., 2018)).
 Prototype selection in its naive form is computationally expensive and perceptually challenging (Bien & Tibshirani, 2012).
Co-registration of multiple images is required for longitudinal studies of land change and environmental degradation.
 We empirically show that the network learns flexible placement policies at a per-node granularity and can scale to problems over 50,000 nodes.
 However, purely judging on the accuracy of the algorithms in such cases would imply an unfair comparison between the methods as it does not measure correctly generalization ability of the models on the new test instances.
 Figure 1(a) is an example of lrDecay, with the learning rate decayed by 10 every 30 epochs.
 In this paper, we would like to answer the following question: can we theoretically explain how neural networks learn the Dark Knowledge? Answering this question will help us to understand the regularization effect of distillation.
 These methods consider only local-range dependencies to save computation because localrange correlations are often much stronger than distant ones.
 In the absence of direct supervision, the additional signal of geometric constraints can help disambiguate visually similar features and reject outliers.
 Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of adistribution, and we hypothesize that including this measure will provide a much stronger constraint towards making these distributions become similar.
 On what basis should we promote asymmetric knowledge transfer? For asymmetric knowledge transfer between tasks, we could use task loss as a proxy of knowledge reliability.
 Therefore, without the warm-up stage, directly using a large learning rate to those parameters may not lead to an improved model and can even make the optimization process unstable.
The new normalization approach and BatchNorm are similar.
Build upon the above achievements, this paper examines a way to improve the stability of the adversarial invariance induction framework.
 Also, existing techniques that utilize a collection of source policies, e.g, policy reuse frameworks (Fernández & Veloso, 2006; Rosman et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2018) and option frameworks (Sutton et al., 1999; Bacon et al., 2017; Mankowitz et al., 2018), are not a promising solution because, to our knowledge, they assume source policies have the same environmental dynamics but have different goals.
 Many practical problems require solutions over time, and need avast number of non-linear operations that often result in substantial changes of the solutions even for small changes of the inputs.
Our GWM can consistently improve the performance of various types of GNN on various types of dataset.
 Briefly, our main contributions are:
Based on this insight, we develop a cyclical training regimen to force the network to ground individual decoded words: decoding −→ localization −→ reconstruction.
Our Contributions.
 We believe that if we can model edge importance as the robustness of proximity graphs to the removal of the edges between vertices, we can produce a proximity graph with less number of edges without dramatically changing the navigability of the graph.
In our paper, we propose to characterize the expressive power of RNN in a quantitative way from the perspective of filtering.
Otherwise, It is called non-homologous test data.
 Such short-term prediction task might be an inadequate proxy for representing the novelty over state space, i.g,, it might be too simple and thus result in inferior novelty scores.
 Our goal is to automatically find an optimal depth.
 For instance, the reinforcement learning (RL) based controller NASNet (Zoph et al., 2018) takes 1800 GPU days and the evolution algorithm based controller AmoebaNet (Real et al., 2018) incurs 3150 GPU days to obtain the best architecture.
 We then solve for the relaxed version of this problem, where the hard constraint is turned into a soft one, and the slack variables are also optimized within the training process.
 One is motivated by-differential privacy ( -DP), which uses∞-divergence to measure the distance between the probabilities of predictions on randomized natural samples and randomized adversarial samples and is therefore called D∞ robustness.
 In theory, we show that APGD has an O(1/T ) convergence rate, where T is the number of iterations.
 We cast the problem of balancing the performance on old tasks and the new task as an optimization problem with composite objective.
 A natural question then arises:Can A-GEM retain the continual learning ability in the presence of adversarial examples in the episodic memory?In this paper, we systematically evaluate the robustness of A-GEM against traditional adversarial attack methods such as FGSM (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and PGD (Madry et al., 2017).
 Yao et al., (2018b) proposed a Deep Multi-View Spatial-Temporal Network (DMVST-Net) framework to model both spatial and temporal relationships.
 The IB framework is intended to explicitly enforce RL agents to learn an efficient representation, hence improving the sample efficiency, by discarding irrelevant information from raw input data.
 This dropout regularization is a proper way of obtaining a Bayesian neural network and also sparsifies the network, since beta-Bernoulli distribution is a sparsity-inducingprior.
 GEV and GPD are employed to model the maximum distance and output the probability that a distance is an extreme value, which indicates the similarity of a sample to a centroid.
 Such overparametrization also has a negative impact on other flow-based generative models, as was pointed out by (Liu et al., 2019), but is especially bad in the case of CNF.
Our specific contributions are:
 The use of quantization methods requires little knowledge from algorithm researchers to hardware.
 Concretely, generalization for GANs means that, the population distance between Dreal and Dg is closed to the empirical distance between the empirical distributions of Dreal and Dg .
However, these models generate justifications that are 1) only tailored for one aspect, and 2) expressed as a hard (binary) selection of words.
 It limits the final classification effect.
 Different metrics have achieved different performances on the different benchmark datasets, although many state-of-the-art models can show similar results (Lucic et al., 2017).
 Without that information, predictions can be way-off.
 The model can be optimized by standard variants of stochastic gradient descent.
 Using a direct-reward paradigm, we show how this framework can be linked precisely to error backpropagation, with q-values updated after every single action.
 To validate the intuition, we empirically apply these algorithms to the constructed or the randomly generated MDPs.
 However, training BicycleGAN (Zhu et al., (2017b)) or its unsupervised counterparts (Huang et al., (2018); Lee et al., (2018)) is not trivial.
 While sparsemax has been previously used in NLP for attention mechanisms over words, it has never been applied to computer vision to attend over image regions.
 Khoo & Ying (2018) introduced a novel neural network architecture, SwitchNet, for solving the wave equation based inverse scattering problems via providing maps betweenthe scatterers and the scattered field.
 Then, we derive the gradient on the original audio through a backpropagation model to be used as the raw perturbation.
 Consider training Cifar-10/ImageNet using the typical staircase schedule.
 We analyze the neighbor sampling technique (Hamilton et al., 2017) to show that a constant number of samples are needed to guarantee the approximation error.
 TS-GLM gives up the ability to fit certain complex interactions, in exchange for focusing on lower-dimensional parameter space and achieves better solution.
” Second, the “corrected” output channels are weighted summed using domain-shared basis coefficients (1×1 convolution) to promote common semantics.
 Under such a framework, the original training set adaptively enriches itself with sample images automatically constructed from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained in parallel.
 Temporal labeling is further characterized by an inevitable trade-off between annotation precision and time investment.
 The discrete structure makes it hard for the GNN to model continuous diffusion processes (Freidlin & Wentzell, 1993; Kondor & Lafferty, 2002) in graphs.
Additionally, the approach seamlessly scales for many languages and improves performance on all high- and low-resource languages tested including English, French, Spanish, German, Greek, Bulgarian, Russian, Turkish, Arabic, Vietnamese, Chinese, Hindi, Swahili and Urdu.
Furthermore, ZO optimization provides computationally-efficient alternatives of high-order optimization methods for solving complex ML/DL tasks, e.g., robust training by leveraging input gradient or curvature regularization (Finlay & Oberman, 2019; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2019), modelagnostic meta-learning (Fallah et al., 2019), network control and management (Chen & Giannakis, 2018), and data processing in high dimension (Liu et al., 2018b).
 In particular, in experiments we see that CLNP automatically takes advantage of the fact that the features of earlier layers are more transferable.
Additionally, we have also evaluated our algorithm on a task of binary classification based on a large number of categorical features.
Despite the advances in using Transformer models for various tasks, their functioning and design choices still remain mysterious and are not well understood.
 Additionally, Hsu et al., (2019) use a Gaussian mixture prior over the latents, which (when interpreting the mixture component index as a high-level discrete latent) allows a form of hierarchical control.
 The sequential procedure makes Scheduled Sampling impractical for training neural networks, particularly on problemsinvolving long sequence generation.
 Reflection in geometry is a mapping that exchanges the locations of two vectors in a Euclidean space by a hyperplane called a mirror, which satisfies the above desired property: working as identity mapping when it is applied twice and when it is applied to vectors on the mirror.
 A natural strategy to stabilize the updates is to clip the magnitude of the stochastic gradients.
 This allows for optimization of properties in the latent space and then the resulting latent space vector is decoded into a candidate molecule that can undergo more rigorous computational testing before it is experimentally synthesized.
 Thus we are required to design an ef-1Our code and models will be made publicly available.
In this work, we run Bayesian optimization with a neural network model.
 In the last decade two main approaches have captured most of the attention; Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs).
 We call these auto-encoder (AE) based models, of which variational auto-encoders (VAEs) are perhapsthe most influential (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014).
 Non-parametric methods (Haarbach et al., 2018) involving motion clip copy/paste or blending has less superiority in smooth transition based on diverse reference sequences.
 After the introduction of deep learning, more robust feature information can be obtained through training and learning, which can effectively improve the performance of the stereo matching algorithm.
 Our contributions are
 For example, DeepGMG (Li et al., 2018) can generate only small graphs, and GraphRNN (You et al., 2018b) cannot consider node/edge labels.
 Because it does not have access to the internal states, parameters, or architecture of the model it is wrapping, the wrapper is model agnostic and can be used on top of any other algorithm as long as it satisfies some desideratum.
 As a result, we find that the rank of child models is very unstable in different runs of the search process, and also very different from ground truth.
 This technique yields many of the benefits of having large batches with much less computational overhead.
 This “transformation” is basically linear transformation in a simple convolution operation, and it also indicates some nonlinear transformation from the ConvNet perspective.
 Algorithmically, at each timestep, our proposed U2GNN iteratively exchanges a node representation with its neighborhood representations using a self-attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017) followed by a recurrent transition to infer node embeddings.
 Yet, Liu et al., (2019) raised a question, is it necessary to fully train a dense, over-parameterized model before finding important structural sparsity?In this paper, we provide a novel answer by exploiting a dynamic approach to deep learning with structural sparsity.
 Formally, we demand the following properties of an algorithm qualified as BoN:• It should incorporate both architecture growth (including filters and layers) and parameter learning simultaneously, in which the width and depth of network can be gradually updated, and the parameters of network should be updated at the same time;• It should provide a comparable classifier for prediction tasks, as the state-of-the-art handcrafted architectures on the same dataset;• Its computational requirements, the total parameters of final boosted network, and memory footprint should remain bounded, ideally in the same order of magnitude as training a manually engineered architecture on the same dataset.
 However, our method can be applied to off-policy methods as well, and we leave this investigation open for future work.
 The first attempt to develop a dependency parser for Amharic language was made in Gasser (2010).
To address these issues, we propose the Contextual Inverse Reinforcement Learning (COIRL) framework.
 On the other hand, in single-head learning, one can not assume from which batch a sample is coming from, hence the need to be able to recognize any samples of 0-9 among classes 0-9.
 At present, PET technology has been widely used in the clinical diagnosis of human diseases.
 The GraphNVP by Madhawa et al., (2019) is the seminal fully invertible-flow approach for graph generation, which successfully combines the invertible maps with the generic graph convolutional networks (GCNs, e.
 Yang et al., (2018) searched for an optimal architecture using inference time as the optimization objective and found different optimal architectures depending on the target device.
 Specifically, given some loss function L, thenorm of the gradient with respect to W k is given by:‖∇WkL‖ = ‖ ∂L ∂yL Jk‖ ≤ ‖ ∂L ∂yL ‖‖Jk‖ (2)Large fluctuations to the Jacobian norm with respect to small perturbations of the weights will, therefore, cause wildly fluctuating gradients during training, hindering training dynamics.
 The interplay between these two objectives leads to several appealing capabilities in pruning, adversarial defense and learning with label noise.
 SLMs also outperform existing models on the restricted expression generation task of Brockschmidt et al., (2019a) in C# by a wide margin, 37.61% compared to 26.42%.
 The latter kind of implication, that is indirectly1http://nlpprogress.
In spite of the remarkable empirical results accomplished by feature distribution matching schemes, they still suffer from a major limitation: the joint distributions of feature spaces and categories are not well aligned across data domains.
 • Calculating żt = g(xt+1,xt) can be more precise than modeling it via żt = zt+1 − zt.
In this work, we propose a unified algorithmic framework aimed to overcome these barriers.
 Via a clustering network (G), which is trained to reconstruct a user-defined similarity matrix (F), the encoded samples get assigned to the data mode-specific decoder subnetworks (which we call experts) in the MoE Decoder (D).
 All the student networks learn simultaneously by teaching each other from the start of training.
 Based on these findings, we claim that enabling the model to rely more on the higher order robust component instead of the adversary-prone lower order component might be the key to achieving decent standard accuracy and adversarial robustness simultaneously.
 These methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance on several domain adaptation benchmarks (Saenko et al., 2010; Venkateswara et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2017) which have significant SFD but limited SLD.
 We consider the samples xp ∼ P and xq ∼ Q.
 Gradient perturbation (Song et al., 2013; Bassily et al., 2014; Abadi et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017; Lee & Kifer, 2018; Jayaraman et al., 2018) perturbs each intermediate update.
 While this is probably the simplest form, it is commonly used in practice, and our analysis is applicable to more complex distributions as well as other approaches.
 We then propose an improved evaluation procedure, extending the recommendations of Machado et al., (2018), named SABER : a Standardized Atari BEnchmark for1Reinforcement learning.
 Thus, standard methods for adjusting for treatment selection bias cannot be easily extended to handle bias in the dosage parameter.
In this paper, we propose MLModelScope: a distributed design which consists of a specification and a runtime that enables repeatable, fair, and scalable evaluation and benchmarking.
 The result is a set of images with potentially relevant, but noisy labels.
 Our analysis shows that under the common Assumption 1, for policy-based RL, designing the algorithm via SMD directly can not guarantee the convergence.
 These embeddings are never transferred back to the server.
However, a major problem prohibiting adversarial training to be practically applicable is the huge computational burden associated with the inner maximization steps: we need to iteratively solve the inner maximization problem to find good adversarial examples for DNN to be robust.
 Second, the LR image generated by downsampling is clear and with no artifacts, while the LR image captured by mobile suffers from many distortions, such asnoise and blur, as shown in fig.  1 (a).
 As the Jacobian is often used to generate adversarial examples, intuitively, we expect that it can be used effectively to detect adversarial perturbations.
We adopt the top-down keypoint detection strategy and put forward a novel detection process, constraining the location information of the keypoint through wheel detection.
 The coefficient β—traditionally, selected constant in 0, 1—controls how quickly the momentum decays, gt represents a stochastic gradient, usually Egt = ∇L(θt), and η > 0 is the step size.
 Furthermore, DWHT can take a strong advantage of its fast version where the computation complexity of the floating point operations is reduced from O(n2) to O(n log n).
 Implicit ensemble methods for AL have been found similarly ineffective, but only evaluated in settings with with < 10 models (Beluch et al., 2018).
 By perturbing the clean data in such a manner, the corruptions are diffused into larger scales and made more difficult to remove (fig.  1 (a)).
 Incorporating labels will exploit the label dependency during learning the metric representation f(·), instead of treating them as independent ones.
 In the sections below, we show how RPGAN allows to understand the factors of variation captured by the particular layer and reveals several interesting findings about the image generation process, e.g, that different layers are “responsible for” coloring or objection location.
 The main technical issue is that the discriminators have to satisfy specific conditions, such as being 1-Lipschitz in the 1-Wasserstein case.
 To this end, we investigate several choices of modeling self-attention across different dimensions.
 To demonstrate the theoretic soundness of this approach, we first present a convergence proof for policy iteration of the proposed objective, under the tabular setting given the assumption of the existence of an expert policy πE(a|s).
 In common sense, instance segmentation is connected detection based on the bounding box strictly, which is more meticulous than the bounding box.
 Even though vector quntization is also a well-known scheme with high compression ratio (Stock et al., 2019), we assume the form of binary codes.
 ProxylessNAS (Cai et al., 2019) is one exception, as it can search for the final models directly; nonetheless they still require twice the amount of memory used by our proposed algorithm.
 They thus use this difference in logit distribution to detect this type of adversarial examples.
 These attempts have achieved great empirical success.
 If the performance is acceptable, the developers can perform a full-scale testing.
 Previously, INNs have been used successfully for unconditional image generation, e.g, by Dinh et al., (2016) and Kingma & Dhariwal (2018).
 Presumably, this is a result of the additional information encoded in the hidden states of wide networks.
 Girdhar et al., (2016); Qi et al., (2016) proposes voxelized-object based method in learning deep object representations, while Kalogerakis et al., (2017); Su et al., (2015)(add) from the perspective of view-based projections.
 The weights of edges are measured by sentences similarity.
 Correspondingly, in generative replay, generative and discriminative models are taken to be separate models (Shin et al., 2017; Farquhar & Gal, 2018; Nguyen et al., 2018).
 (3) Even at the expense of sacrificing generative performance, the semi-supervised classification results are still not satisfactory.
 While modular architectures overcome forgetting by design, the memory complexity of these approaches scales with the number of tasks.
 More importantly, they proved that unsupervised learning of disentangled representation is impossible without introducing inductive bias on either the model or the data.
 Extending asymmetric actor-critic methods, APRiL concurrently trains two actor-critic systems (one symmetric, state-based agent, and another asymmetric agent with imagedependent actor).
 These methods run into two different kinds of problems.
 With no further assumptions on the data distribution and the network architecture, we show that the dropout regularizer is a data-dependent measure whose expected value serves as a strong complexity measure for networks trained with dropout.
 To make the scorer adaptive, we perform frequent and efficient updates of the scorer network using a reward function inspired by recent work on learning using data from auxiliary tasks (Du et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019b), which use the similarity between two gradients as a measure of task relevance.
 This PRW learning signal promotes a latent space where points of the same class are compactly clustered around their prototype, while being well isolated from other prototypes.
 Our main contributions in this work are:
 We find that methods based on conventional (context-free) word embeddings support generalization that is driven by lexical similarity (executing lift a vehicle when trained to lift a car), but capture phrasal equivalence less well (failing at put a plate on the container when trained to put the dish on the tray).
 Pairwise (dis)similarities between points (used by the previous DR methods) seem to be insufficient in capturing the global structure.
 Starting from such a concept of robustness with respect to changes of features, we derive a measure of flatness that is invariant under the mentioned reparameterizations and that reduces to the well-known ridge regression penalty in the special case of a linear regression.
 Second, one of our techniques will explicitly address the situation where the ‘sufficiently related’ clause partially breaks down.
 While heuristic approaches are more flexible to changes in the model setup and allow the study of transient behavior, agent strategies can be toosimplistic.
A related setting is Batch RL (Antos et al., 2007; Lazaric et al., 2008; Lange et al., 2012), which we emphasize assumes the existing data comes from a single MDP.
We additionally evaluate the models on the smaller KTH actions dataset (Schuldt et al. (2004)).
In the few-shot setting, within each episode, what is in-distribution is specified based on a few labeled examples, known as the support set.
 Each level of the tree represents a different taxonomic rank, with finer ranks such as species and genus being close to the leaf nodes and coarser ranks such as phylum and class closer to the root.
 This work has the following key contributions:
Our goal is different from the aforementioned approaches.
 It is obvious that‖x− Topk(x)‖2 ≤ ‖x− Randk(x)‖2 and ER‖x− Randk(x)‖2 = (1− k/d)‖x‖2.
 Our policy optimization is based on Policy Gradient, which has been widely adopted in MFRL (Lillicrap et al., 2015; Schulman et al., 2017; Haarnoja et al., 2018).
 The first is a conditional production rule generating neural network (NN) of the desired polynomial leading powers that generates production rules to construct novel expressions (both syntactically and semantically) and, more surprisingly, generalize to leading powers not in the training set.
 Hence, carefully reducing the input dimension may improve the robustness of the model without sacrificing performance.
 Meta-learning is to design a learner based on several training tasks that can generalize well to future tasks (Naik & Mammone, 1992; Thrun & Pratt, 2012; Hochreiter et al., 2001).
 The second regularization term minimizes the Euclidean distancebetween the training accuracy of a DNN and its average confidence in its predictions on the training set.
 It is common knowledge among neural network practitioners that deeper networks train slower (Bengio et al., 1994; Glorot & Bengio, 2010).
 On six text classification tasks, our method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art models.
 This makes ALI-G well-suited to the deep learning setting, where hyper-parameter tuning is widely regarded as an onerous and time consuming task.
 The main goal of this work is to develop general remote sensing representations that can be applied by researchers to other unseen remote sensing tasks.
 However, modern classifiers based on neural networks are not linear and and can have non-zero curvatures in different parts of the input domain.
 This subset may or may not overlap with those of other tasks.
 In particular, an animal learning to walk on a different terrain does not just imitate its existing gait, but adapts it to the new environment.
Given the aforementioned benefits and reasonable performances of tree-based methods, why is deep learning worth exploring for tabular data? One obvious motivation is pushing the performance albeit an increased computational cost, especially with more training data.
To address the first challenge, we formulate a heterogeneous operator cell characterised by a novel heterogeneous residual block.
 We do this with the hope of understanding to what degree counter machines, and LSTMs by extension, have computational properties well-suited for representing the structure of natural language.
 Our contributions are:
 Using the surrogate enables more efficient sampling, since it avoids querying the expensive PDE solvers, and obtaining gradients is as efficient as evaluating the functions themselves using automatic differentiation frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.
In this work, we propose a hybrid learning paradigm that unifies turbulence modeling and deep representation learning.
 In Section 4.2, we build a PAC-MDP algorithm called Lipschitz RMax, applying this transfer method online in the Lifelong RL setting.
 In this paper, we refer image-search noise in these datasets as “real-world noise” to distinguish it from synthetic label-flipping noise.
 To find out if r(h, t) is a fact (i.g, is true), such models define a function that embeds relation r and entities h and t, and produces the probability that r(h, t) is a fact.
 In this article, we work towards bridging the gap between theoretically robust networks and empirically effective training methods.
 Assume that a deep network has only learned curved edge features from training images of the digit ‘0’.
 In other words, if the edges of the graph are correlated with sensitive metadata, then any algorithm which does not explicitly model and remove this correlation will be biased as a result of it.
 Symbolic programs provide a compositional “language of thought” (Fodor, 1975) for creatively synthesizing which questions to ask, allowing the model to construct new ideas based on familiar building blocks.
 A pre-trained coherence classifier is further applied to regularize the generated target sentence to be consistent with the context.
 Thus, CCAT implicitly biases the network to predict the uniform distribution over classes beyond the adversarial examples seen during training.
 We theoretically analyze general regularizations and provide guidelines on how to select regularization.
Many embedding methods correspond to matrix factorization, indeed some attributed embedding methods (e.g, Yang et al., (2018)) explicitly factorize a matrix of link-attribute information.
 Unlike task-specific metrics such as BLEU score, teacher models summarize training data points and structure knowledge in an abstract, hierarchical manner.
 This effectively allows us to detect incongruence between the prediction made by the network and the path by which it arrived at that prediction.
 We first propose a conditional graph GAN architecture that consists of an encoder-decoder translator and a conditional graph discriminator to learn the one-to-more mapping (a conditional distribution) for graph translation.
 In TPO, we use tree search as an expert to generate high quality trajectories.
 The overall context-aware deep object detection network, corresponds to a deep architecture with a traditional CNN-based module concatenated by a context-aware module, can be trained end-to-end following the common practice of back-propagation in deep neural networks.
 ParaNet iteratively refines the attention alignment between text and spectrogram in a layer-by-layer manner, and it can produce stable attentions on the challenging test sentences as DV3 with attention masking.
 As a remedy to this problem, Bekoulis et al., (2018a) proposes a neural, end-to-end system that jointly learns to extract entities and relations without relying on external NLP tools.
 Moreover, CoNAS can achieve the comparable performance as NASNet (Zoph et al., 2018) and AmoebaNet (Real et al., 2019) with less than one GPU-day of computation.
 They highlight fine-grained details in the image but are not class-discriminative for visual explanation.
The main contributions of this paper are:
 However, the GLM could only account for the output generated by the last layer and this output is not easy to interpret because it potentially contains mixed levels of features.
 In particular, the pruning applied to AlexNet is used to explore and study whether one can obtain a new single class classifier by dropping the selected filters in the original multi-class classifier instead of an expensive training process of a new classifier.
Adversarial attacks need knowledge of models.
 In this example, it is obvious that the optimal clustering is the result of cutting the edge connecting the two triangles.
 Whats even worse is that the computational complexity will increase quadratically with the length, which will result in an unacceptable training time.
 However, the distribution of most real images are inconsistent with the hypothetical Gaussian distribution.
 In contrast to GANs, we do not require adversarial training.
 However, predicted reactions are unlikely to encompass multiple reaction classes (see Figure 2) without additional guidance.
 However, the same underlying architecture can be made to strongly generalize by introducing minor modifications and more supervision.
 Once the human’s intended goal is discovered, the robot can provide assistance.
 However, generating a single gibberish sentence will give away the identity of the artificial agent.
 While training with RL, we penalize divergence from this prior model with different forms of KL-control.
 SPE is also more computation efficient to train than HIB, with complexity comparable to that of the PN, and has no hand-tuned parameters.
 It aims to learn multiple layers of policies, in which the higher layer breaks down the task into several easier sub-tasks and proposes corresponding sub-goals for the lower layer to achieve.
Solving the problem of arbitrarily long input requires more than a cursory glance.
 Our contributions are
Finally, similar to experiments in (Chen et al., 2018), to alleviate the need for careful choice or design of contour embedding functions, we propose a NODE-based method that evolves an image embedding into a dense per-pixel semantic label space.
 The pre-trained model can be finetuned for downstream supervised tasks and has been shown to produce state-of-the-art results on a number of NLP benchmarks.
 In summary, we find strong empirical support for our claim that NormLIME provides accurate and human-understandable explanations for deep neural networks.
 In general, a quantified Boolean formula in prenex normal form can be expressed as such:QiXiQi−1Xi−1...Q0X0. φwhere Qi are quantifiers that always differ from their neighboring quantifiers, Xi are disjoint sets of Boolean variables, and φ is a propositional formula with all Boolean variables bounded in Qi.
 Further, curriculum learning approaches have not been shown to compete with simple training strategies at the top end of performance in image benchmarks.
 An effective solution to the above challenge is a multi-scale architecture,introduced by Dinh et al., (2016), which performs iterative early gaussianization of a part of the total dimensions at regular intervals of flow layers.
Intuitively, we would like to learn a transition model in a way that it can reproduce the trajectories that have been generated in the real world.
 In addition, it requires considerable amount of efforts to design more effective position embeddings or different ways to incorporate them in the learning process (Dai et al., 2019).
 This challenge was addressed by the original role-based alignment of Lucey et al., (2013) and subsequently by Bialkowski et al., (2016) and Sha et al., (2017).
The primary findings of our work can be summarized as follows:
 In order to obtain good latent representations, we propose a novel approach to regularize the latent space by using information-theoretic constraints.
 However, to the best of our knowledge, Watters et al., (2019) is the only work that investigates the usefulness of slot-structured representations for RL.
 Hence, when learning a latent space in generative models, it becomes interesting to find a disentangled representation.
 Laterre et al., (2018) enlighten by AlphaZero (Silver et al., 2017) adopt Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with self-competition reinforcement learning to solve the packing problem, but it is restrained to pack boxes that have beenpreliminarily divided from a bin.
 It is the fact that objects can be accurately classified since the same type of objects share similar appearance.
 Moreover, we do not restrict ourselves to a single attention mechanism and also explore models with self-attention.
 If the model capacity is only sufficient for the natural learning, the adversarial training can converge to a constant function.
 For some data point, the classification result of this deep learning model may be the correct minority.
 1: Require: hyper-parameters σ, K and η.
 Since the similarity is calculated from two images and possibly based on several similar patterns between them, the relationship between these patterns is critical for understanding the model.
 We believe that the absence of this molecular graph information hinders the further improvement of the present methods for retrosynthesis.
 As for the training label for the i-th subject, we have two recordings: event indicator δi ∈ {0, 1} specifies whether the i-th subject died, and observed time Yi ∈ R+ is the i-th subject’s “survival time” (time until death) if δi = 1 or the “censoring time” if δi = 0.
 This poses a number of issues, including increased memory requirements (more landmarks required to capture the foreground) and lower landmark reliability (landmarks assigned to background are unstable).
 Deep graph neural networks generalizes the message functions to neural networks.
 To make things worse, when there is a class-balance problem where the number of negative examples are overwhelmingly larger than that of positive examples (which is true in many real-world use cases), the model will be at loose ends because positive features are buried in the sea of negative features.
The key idea behind Kraska et al., (2018) is to use the machine learning model as a pre-filter to give each query x a score s(x).
 The phenomenon, known as the lottery ticket hypothesis is an encouraging step towards finding small, high-utility architectures.
Borrowing from theory in graph signal processing, we propose LaPool (Laplacian Pooling), a differentiable pooling method that takes into account both the graph structure and its node features.
 On the other hand, another master will provide additional information.
 SAEs have been considered in the literature (Xiao et al., 2018; Dreossi et al., 2018b; Huang et al., 2019), but prior works typically consider a small set of fixed transformations (e.g, rotation and translation, or modifying a single object’s texture).
 Solutions found by search algorithms are then used as demonstrations for RL algorithms, initializing them in regions of policy parameter space where the return surface is not flat.
Our contributions.
 This indicator is defined as the discriminability distillation regulation (DDR).
 The primary idea of GLAS is to perturb an input image by the Gaussian mask (light) and inverse-Gaussian mask (shadow) and, then, record the responses of the perturbed images.
 For those states with no dependency on the current action, there will be a close-to-zero dependency factor Cπ , and the importance sampling estimator can reduce the variance of advantage estimation by ignoring the rewards on these states.
 For example, as shown in fig. 1(a,b), the inhibited channels exist in many “Norm+ReLU-like” basic block such as ‘LN+ReLU’, ‘BN+ELU’ and ‘BN+ReLU’.
 For training purposes, we usually assume that we have multiple such trajectories, possibly of different lengths, but we omit the sequence indices from our notations for simplicity.
 We borrow this idea and the associated scoring functions via making a connection through treating each classifier’s prediction as an agent’s private information to be elicited and evaluated, and the noisy label as an imperfect reference from a “noisy label agent”.
 To learn them it suffices to define the BEM and the cost function between points in the PPE space.
1 Our model consists of three neural networks – an encoder, a selector, and a predictor – and a set of centroid candidates.
 Most of these NLP problems use linear transformations, in the first and the third components of the models.
 If the topology is structured, efficient software or hardware implementations can be built to accelerate processing with dense network performance .
 However, Cluster-GCN ignores all the inter-cluster links, which are not negligible in many real-world networks.
 As a result, even though adaptive gradient methods are relatively easy to tune and convergefaster at the early stage, recent advances in designing neural network structures are all reporting their performances by training their models with SGD-momentum (He et al., 2016; Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014; Ren et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2017; Howard et al., 2017).
 It considers the case when the neural network is very wide at each layer, which enables the theoretical analysis via the statistical concentration property of the parameter matrix.
• Siamese trackers often incorporate a small displacement prior by restricting the search area to be near the previous bounding box.
 There are two issues in this formulation.
 Moreover, the information gap between the classification loss and the constraints in turn increases the difficulty of tuning hyper-parameters.
 There are major benefits to this design strategy, in particular:• Memory scalability.
It’s worth to note that most of SC based methods utilize the sparse prior locally (Papyan et al., 2017b), i.g,, coping with overlapping image patches.
 However robust features are not easy to construct directly (Madaan & Hwang, 2019).
 (1) since A(L(M(w;λ),D)) is a complicated function w.r.t λ, which might be non-differentiable.
 In addition, when combined with VAEs, PGAs can generate sharper samples than vanilla VAEs.
 A novel cost function that considers the model compression and prediction accuracy is also proposed in the DAS process.
 We also construct a detectornetwork which serves as the dual network for the target classifier to be defended.
 Similar low-pass observation and results have also been mentioned by other works by Li et al., (2018), Qiu et al., (2018), and Li et al., (2019).
 Instead, our work is a propulsion on a different frontier, i.g,, learning recursively parameterized models which bears a totally different meaning.
 To summarize, our contributions are as:
 In order to overcome these shortcomings, researchers have resorted to reporting conditional consistency and diversity metrics in conjunction with FID (Zhao et al., 2019; Park et al., 2019).
 However, these works approach the problem only from network structure perspective, ignoring the importance of network input.
 Inspired by work in neural architecture search (NAS) (Zoph & Le, 2016; Baker et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2018), we propose a first attempt to automatically find the optimal PBL architecture, taking into account characteristics of not just data, but also physics.
 A low-resolution, subsampled spectrogram that captures high-level structure is generated initially, followed by an iterative upsampling procedure that adds high-resolution details.
 We contend that while obtaining such implicit human feedback through EEG is less burdensome, it is still a time-intensive task for the subject and the experimenter alike.
 Our method select the nodes based on node features propagated through the graph structure,1Our code will be released upon acceptance.
Main Contributions.
 Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of GAN-TSC for tabular data (for which GANs are seldom used), image data, random forest classifiers, and DNN classifiers.
In this paper, we propose a novel GMM having two important properties: sparsity and discriminability, which is named sparse discriminative Gaussian mixture (SDGM).
 The temporal patterns for the smooth region areclose to those of most of their closest neighbors except the region with yellow color 1 in terms of shape and magnitude.
In this paper, we propose a Granger cAusal StructurE Reconstruction (GASER) framework for inductive Granger causality learning and common causal structure detection on heterogeneous multivariate time series data.
 We show that the model is capable of learning to generate crisp and varied samples.
 Instead of an explicit vector of factors that is input to a generator function, or object slots that are blended to form an image, our unified treatment defines factors of variation and object slots via energy functions.
 Recently, deep learning methods use the reconstruction error of an autoencoder-based model for outlier detection, either by considering the reconstruction error itself as an outlier score (18; 20) or by leveraging the reconstruction error in a more sophisticated way (10; 19; 9).
 Our main contributions are:
 Also, even though there are questions that require common sense, existing modelsdo not utilize it: previous models memorize explanations appropriate to each situation in training datasets (Park et al., 2018; Zellers et al., 2019).
 Tsipras et al., (2019) presents an inherent trade-off between accuracy and robust accuracy and argues that the phenomenon comes from the fact that robust classifiers learn different features.
 Finally, our framework is generic and is easily integrated into conventional imitation learning approaches.
 The trend is that the loss functions become increasingly complicated but are difficult to understand.
 Modeling any combination of data modalities is not well-established yet, which apparently limits the potential of such models, since raw data in real-life is usually acquired in a multimodal manner (Ngiam et al., 2011) with more than one source of data gathered to represent a practical scenario.
 A principled approach to address the curse of dimensionality is tensor decomposition, where a higher-order tensor is compressed into smaller core tensors (Anandkumar et al., 2014).
 Continuous reconfiguration of the sparsity pattern is expensive as it does not allow for compression of weights during training.
 In particular, current GCNs depend on stacking separate graph pooling layers after graph convolution layers to build deep hierarchy, similar to early lattice CNN architectures such as AlexNet and VGGNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014).
 If we do not consider the best path among this set, we could fail to see to what extent models are intrinsically connected.
 Also, we define Rm(f) = m−1 ∑m i=1 L(Yi, f(Xi)) and R(f) = EL(Y, f(X)) as an empirical and expected loss value L(Y, f(X)).
We make the following contributions in this paper:
 This is in sharp contrast with GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Arjovsky et al., 2017) and flow-based models (Ho et al., 2018), where most of them can reach state-of-the-art results with only one latent variable, with clear semantic meanings.
 Afterwards we analyze Lipschitz bounds of commonly used invertible neural network building blocks.
Our contribution.
 Firstly, many methods require a clean set of samples whose labels can be trusted.
Contributions
 The idea is to start with a coarse, mean-field approximation q(w) and make iterative, local refinements to it.
 Random walk enables our model to be applicable to previously unseen graph structures, and a mixture of random walks alleviates the oversmoothing problem, allowing global information to be included during training.
 For these methods, it is not clear what the main estimand is, if it can be consistently estimated or if (and how) the estimand can be computed more efficiently.
 However, non-robust features are not expected to have good model interpretability.
In this work, we propose CONQUR (CONsistent Q-Update Regression), a general framework for integrating policy-consistent backups with regression-based function approximation for Q-learning and for managing the search through the space of possible regressors (i.g,, information sets).
 When the distance information captures in-trinsic class structure in the data, the representation learner is optimised to learn the class structure to minimise the prediction error.
 As a result, the solution cannot really reflect the robustness of the targeted model.
 Memorization happens widely in various architectures of deep network, e.g, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN).
 While improved model performance was achieved by these methods, they have overhead of performing same classification task in at least two stages.
 By attacking fewer steps, the attacker reduces the costs of generating, injecting, and hiding the adversarial examples.
Our DS-VIC method identifies decision states without extrinsic rewards, solely by interacting with partially-observable environments.
 One of the key assumptions in Lee et al., (2018a) and Sricharan & Srivastava (2018) is that the effect of maximizing the entropy for OOD samples close to the low-density boundaries of in-distribution might also propagate to samples that are far away from in-distribution.
Our proposed method solves the above problem by building upon the GAIL (Ho & Ermon, 2016; Finn et al., 2016) framework, by firstly conditioning the policy on a learned dynamics embedding (“context variable” in policy search literature (Deisenroth et al., 2013)).
 For its formulation, we define Truncated Q-functions, representing the return for the first n steps of a target-policy rollout w.r.t. the full action-value.
 Recently, it has been shown (Ratzlaff & Fuxin, 2019) that training such kind of generators can be done in classification problems and the resulting draws of1As noted in (Osband et al., 2018), it is the (epistemic) uncertainty in agent’s belief, rather than the (aleatoric) uncertainty of outcome which reflects the inherent randomness of the environment, that matters the most regarding efficient exploration in RL.
 Further, achieving robustness on par with the human visual system is thought to require major changes in training procedures and datasets: the current state of the art in robustness benchmarks involves creating a custom dataset with styled-transferred images before training (Geirhos et al., 2018a), and still incurs a significant drop in clean accuracy.
With this insight, we propose Streamlined Off Policy (SOP), a streamlined algorithm using the standard objective without the entropy term.
 Most of our experiments are conducted on ImageNet; we remark indeed that deep networks trained on smallerdatasets such as CIFAR-10 are already sparse at convergence, making pruning less challenging, and conclusions drawn about lottery tickets potentially misleading if this effect is not accounted for.
 In the parlance of probability, the process of x 7→ z = f(x) is called inference, and the other procedure of z 7→ x = g(z) is called sampling or generation.
 In this work, our contributions are summarized as follows:
 In some cases, this result is masked by loss curves that look identical to the original training.
To demonstrate the power of UNITER, we evaluate on six V+L tasks across nine datasets, including: (i) VQA; (ii) Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) (Zellers et al., 2019); (iii) NLVR2 (Suhr et al., 2019); (iv) Visual Entailment (Xie et al., 2019); (v) Image-Text Retrieval (including zero-shot setting) (Lee et al., 2018); and (vi) Referring Expression Comprehension.
 For instance, Nguyen et al., (2017) proposed a stochastic gradient descent hard thresholding (SG-HT) algorithm, whosegradient and hard thresholding complexities are both O(κs̃ log( 1 )).
 We then seek a policy that wants to lower the loss of the representation learning objective, while the model itself tries to optimize this loss.
 Existing FL personalization workdirectly takes a converged initial model and conducts personalization evaluation via gradient descent (Beaufays et al., 2019).
 Therefore, the separability condition is rather weak in this sense but it is enough to ensure global convergence for the classification problems.
 However, it remains unclear whether those GANs have similarly nice properties in the multi-modal setting.
 In contrast to a Nash equilibrium, which exists inany game with a finite action set, not every game is dominance solvable.
 During adversarial learning, for each round, the G is trained several epochs and then, the D is trained tens of epochs.
 Many object ZSL methods (Lampert et al., 2014; 2009) adopt the pre-defined attributes ofobjects to recognize the unseen object.
 Furthermore, Euclidean distance matrices are useful determinants of valid molecular structures.
 However, they are mainly geared towards studying proteins and their folding dynamics (AlQuraishi, 2019).
 Imputation makes use of an indirect supervision from the complete source domain.
 While the existing approaches showed that it is possible to adjust the hallucinator to generate examples that are helpful for classification, the generation process is still far from producing effective samples in the few-shot regime.
 SDIM is trained by optimizing two objectives: (1) maximizing the mutual information (MI) between the inputs and the high-level data representations from encoder; (2) ensuring that the representations satisfy the supervised statistical constraints.
 In particular, the gap grows larger when the problem requires solutions with higher dimensions or more complex structures.
 Our bias is loosely inspired by how scientists often work (Mill’s method of difference): in looking for potential causes of a phenomenon, a scientist would often focus on the differences in the circumstances (features) in the instance in which the phenomenon occurred and the circumstances in instances for which the phenomenon did not occur (Mill, 1875).
 The proposed CloudLSTM takes into account the locations of each data source and performs dynamic positioning at each time step, to conduct a deformable convolution operation over point-clouds (Dai et al., 2017).
 Directly using this objective is often intractable, since it requires optimizing the entropy of the marginal state distribution of the policy,H(S).
 The main contributions of the paper are summarised in the following points:
 Further, one might expect augmentation to be most helpful in low data settings.
To this end, Yu et al., (2019) introduced switchable batch normalization (BN) (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015), which switches BN layers according to pre-defined widths, and proposed “slimmable” networks whose width can be changed after training.
 The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows.
 Indeed, if the end goal of every episode is to classify the query set according to the same class semantics, do we even need the support set to define the classes, once the semantics are learned ? Consider the characters below, extracted from the “Mongolian” alphabet of Omniglot.
 However, this not sufficient for CVAEs because in the conditional case the complexity of the distributions are highly dependent on the condition.
 This property also naturally enables feature interpolation between arbitrary inputs.
 2) it can be embedded into existing NAS framework and improve the performance of current NAS methods.
Hence, inspired by the increasing invariance observed along the primate ventral visual stream, we subsequently propose data augmentation invariance, a simple, yet effective and efficient mechanism to improve the robustness of the representations: we include an additional, unsupervised term in the objective function that encourages the similarity between augmented examples within each batch.
 This problem can become more severe in spare reward settings.
 As aresult, the learned model is causally incorrect.
 For instance, we may obtain a gradient vector orthogonal to all gradients of previous tasks in the constrained optimization problem.
 It is possible to impose symmetry constraints at any desired layer during this computation.
 Therefore, even if the cumulative return is greater, the cumulative discount return is even smaller.
 To achieve the best privacy/accuracy tradeoffs, we must tune our learning strategies to the specifics of privacy-preserving learning; i.g,, we must “learn to learn” with privacy.
 DSG loses accuracy on ImageNet dataset.
Contributions.
 The pioneering work (Xu et al., 2019) first shows that data generated from conditional GANs (Mirza & Osindero, 2014) enjoys better model compatibility than VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2013).
 This approach has the benefit of training the policy on a state distribution that is close to that induced by the policy itself, while using local search or planning over a smaller horizon to generate a good policy to train towards.
 The compression rate of the encoding method is affected by the entropy of weight distributions.
To alleviate privacy attacks, we propose using models that depend on the causal relationship between input features and the output.
 The imaginary context contains a fixed number of context points and is modeled as a random variable sampled at every time-step.
 Recently, more and more large models, such as deep learning models, are used in machine learning to improve the generalization ability.
We begin this paper by comparing neural networks trained on two different problems: the MNIST task, where one aims to discriminate odd from even digits in the in the MNIST data set; and the vanilla teacher-student setup, where inputs are drawn as vectors with i.i.d. component from the Gaussian distribution and labels are given by a random, but fixed, neural network acting on the high-dimensional inputs.
 These assumptions hold for most tasks.
 Practically this can be achieved by learning neural network encoders and decoders, where channels are simulated by adding noise to encoded messages.
 Our reasons behind this narrower focus: (a) We wanted to create a scalable RL benchmark with emphasis on the length of proofs.
In addition, we show how to extend the SL complex constraints that would normally lead to intractably large circuits.
 This problem is further exacerbated with the addition of the synthetic likelihood term in the hybrid VAE-GAN objective – it is necessary for sample quality but it introduces additional constraints on the encoder/decoder.
 While these approaches have achieved state-of-the-art results in important domains including automatic chemical design and automatic machine learning (Gómez-Bombarelli et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2018), their practical effectiveness is limited by their ability to handle the following trade-off: They need to find inputs x that both have a high target value y and are sufficiently novel (i.g,, not too close to inputs in the training data D), while at the same time ensuring that the optimization w.r.t. y does not progress into regions of the latent space Z too far away from the training data, which might yield latent points z that decode to semantically meaningless and/or syntactically invalid inputs x (Kusner et al., 2017; Griffiths & Hernández-Lobato, 2017; Brookes et al., 2019; Mahmood & Hernández-Lobato, 2019; Alperstein et al., 2019).
 To this end, in addition to trying different representation learning architectures, we develop a dynamic intermedium attention memory network (DIAMNet) to iteratively attend the query pattern and the target data graph to memorize different local subgraph isomorphisms for global counting.
We develop a fully embedded feature selection method for nonlinear models.
 Each of the non-anchors should be easily induced by some transformation from (a few) nearby anchors.
 However, it has been empirically observed by Lakshminarayanan et al., (2017); Lee et al., (2015) that training individual networks with just random initialization is sufficient in practice and using the bootstrap even hurts performance in some cases (e.g, for small ensemble sizes).
 An ideal algorithm would exploit the efficiency of model-based methods while maintaining DRL’s relative robustness to poor local minima.
 We found that a pixel reconstruction loss is vital for learning a good representation, specifically when trained end-to-end.
In this paper, we propose a new method for crafting data-free UAPs for any given CNN using ReLU nonlinearity.
 We also investigate the origin of the parameter divergence in both empirical and theoretical ways.
 Also for this task we rely on WL to reduce the burden of manual annotations: touching interfaces are specified with rough scribbles, cf. top left part of Figure 1.
 could be relevant to the user.
 To this end, we derive a training objective that marginalises over all different generation sequences yielding the correct output, which implicitly encourages copying longer spans.
1. Batch normalization does enable training with significantly larger learning rates, and this enables practictioners to efficiently parallelize training over much larger minibatches.
 For example, Harchaoui et al., (10) introduced a test statistic using the maximum kernel fisher discriminant ratio.
Let’s first look at the question of whether generative pre-training is well suited for images or not.
 In addition to adapting the methods, we address the question of whether the best-performing image-level methods maintain their performance when adapted to the new task.
 Unfortunately, traditional methods do not scale and perform well on these data.
 Therefore, in our formulation, we have an extra term, h(S|Z), which encourages maximizing the entropy of the state conditioned on the reference points.
 Motivated by this, several studies focus on designing DNNs that incorporate domain knowledge, namely, signal priors.
 At least, this is a danger when substituting structure to replace learning.
 Combined approaches appeared quite early (McCallum & Nigam, 1998; Zhu et al., 2003).
 More specifically, we introduce the notion of attribute, which can be defined flexibly as the evaluation task needs.
 There have been several real transportation plans considering social equity (Arsenio et al., 2016).
 Hence, this problem can be formulated as a style transfer problem, where one speaker’s style is converted into another while preserving the linguistic content as it is.
 We see at least two use-cases: (1) Speaker recognition and diarization (i.g,, infer who is talking within an audio signal) with multiple simultaneous speakers: Given an audio signal containing speakers who were not part of the training set and who may be speaking simultaneously, and given one example of each person speaking in isolation (one-shot learning), infer which set of speakers is talking.
 On the other hand, conventional relation-based methods can make class predictions using only the learned image–attribute relation, not requiring enormous image generation and additional classifier training after training the model.
Since in Q-FP, we are trying to represent the infinite set of real numbers using a finite number of bits, quantization and rounding artefacts will be introduced, with inaccuracies being cascaded along the computation graph (IEEE, 1985; Goldberg, 1991; Higham, 2002).
The advent of deep learning platforms equipped with efficient automatic differentiation tools allows the exploration of more sophisticated models that incorporate intricate regularizations, both explicit1Under some technical conditions.
 However, training-based approaches to design robust DNNs also degrade classification accuracy for clean images, and more importantly, are effective only when noise structure (and magnitude) during training and inference closely match.
 We also experiment with several variations on position encodingsinspired by this justification, and although they do not yield any improvement, we do find that learned position encodings in our representation do better than learning a different vector for each absolute position.
 The difficulty lies in knowing what can be ignored and what cannot.
 Assuming that the network consists of several layers, where each layer consists of several components, the core idea of the proposed method is to learn, for each component, a set of binary allocation variables indicating which tasks use this component.
Our model consists of the following two components.
 In order to introduce controls to the agents for interactive applications, we use a constraint representation along with a different framework for training and use the constrained painting agent.
OC-MAML builds upon model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) (Finn et al., 2017), which is a meta-learning method that explicitly optimizes for few-shot learning and yields a model initializationthat enables quick adaptation to a new task using only few of its datapoints.
 We refer to this approach as ‘limited self-supervision.
The work detailed in this paper can be connected to other articles (Socher et al., (2013); Guu et al., (2018); Siffer et al., (2017)), though our framework is different.
 Parameter estimation must use the sparse remaining connections to explain the observed data.
 Communication costs may thwart the anticipated benefits of reducing computational costs.
 In this case, the Conjugate Kernel was referred to as the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) kernel.
 In this work wewill build on the latter approaches by creating a method that is not restricted by modality type.
 The LMN with the autoencoder initialization is a recurrent architecture equivalent to the Elman RNN but able to solve the vanishing gradient problem and memorize input sequences with a minimal hidden state.
 These neural networks build thegraph hierarchy in the preprocessing step, which defines in advance how pooling is performed given a graph.
 Yet the attention in vanilla Transformer does not focus on them but gives credits to some irrelevant words such as “him”.
 We produce a simpler proof than in the pioneering work of Raghu et al., (2017), which also generalises their results, deriving similar lower bounds for a broader class of random deep neural networks.
 It is of great importance that the processed images be recognizable by not only humans, but also by machines.
 Data driven supervised methods have thus attained impressive results and are able to accurately complete a large missing region.
 Our distillation model is comprised of (1) a single body and (2) as many heads as there are members in the original ensemble.
 As shown in (Huszár, 2015), minimizing forward KL divergence often leads to models that overgeneralize, and sometimes produce samples that are very unlikely under true distribution and thus it is good at diversity.
 Such a strategy might be based on modeling uncertainty of the value function approximation (e.g, using dropout sampling, variational inference, distributional RL, bootstrap ensemble, etc.).
since they require a low false positive rate.
 EI offers an appealing option to balance computational complexity vs. bias on popular benchmarks in machine learning.
Specifically, we show a proof-of-concept multichannel modeling by extending KERMIT (Chan et al., 2019) to model the joint distribution over multiple sequence channels.
 We then experimentally and theoretically analyze how graph structure properties influence the optimal choice of graph convolutional filters.
 To summarize, our contributions for this paper are:
 Notably, even in the absence of an explicit meta-learning algorithm machine learning practitioners employ “manual meta-learning”, also called “grad student descent” (Gencoglu et al., 2019) in the iterative process of algorithm design, model selection, hyperparametertuning, etc.
 Order-aware Embedding Neural Network (Guo et al., 2019) learns an order-specific latent vector for each binary feature in Higher-order Factorization Machines.
Rapid changes or moving patterns in two consecutive observations essentially serve as important signals to motivate an agent for exploration.
In this paper, we take another step towards addressing the limitations of current weakly-supervised video moment retrieval methods by exploiting the fine-grained temporal and visual relevance of each video frame to each word (Figure 1b).
 Surprisingly, this representation also surpasses supervised methods when given the entire ImageNet dataset (+1% Top-5 accuracy).
In this article we demonstrate the applicability of ML for the energy prediction of unstable molecular and crystalline systems, where the atoms are at positions which are not at the DFT calculated minimum of potential energy, in the following referred to as either “unstable” or “out-of-equilibrium”.
 We find that various properties of knowledge graph representation models, including the relativeperformance of leading link prediction models, accord with predictions based on these relation conditions, suggesting a commonality to the latent structure learned in word embedding models and knowledge graph representation models, despite the significant differences between their training data and methodology.
 To be able to select plausible harder samples, a generative model is employed for embedding data into a low-dimensional latent space with better compactness and smoothness.
 This capability is called situation awareness (SA) (Endsley, 2017).
Our paper extends the state of the art in 8-bit floating point (FP8) training with the following key contributions:
In this work, we extend the line of research of (14).
 For neurons in subsequent layers, the boundaries are “bent hyperplanes” that bend where they intersect boundaries associated with earlier layers.
 To this end, we propose a neural network architecture, including several sub-networks, that can be trained in an end-to-end fashion to capture the complex relationships between language, vision, and motion observed in the demonstrations.
 Since many natural sparse signals tend to have clustered sparse structure, this pattern has been widely exploited in many practical applications such as gene expression analysis (Tibshirani et al., 2005), and inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging (Lv et al., 2014).
 Their experimental results have shown promising performance in both cases where the input graph is either corrupted or not available.
To enforce even splits while maintaining the discriminability, the CoBRF uses the hyperplanes estimated by the linear support vector machine (SVM).
 The flow of DAC is shown in fig.  1 where all abstractions are dark blue shapes.
 Concretely – among other results – we are the first to create and certify a provable ImageNet classifier (with high confidence) for image translation and rotation.
In this work, we propose a differentiable BNN (DBNN) inference with respect to an input data.
Observation 3.
 Different from the previous methods, we employ a collaboration network which is a connection of the front part of the student network and the back part of the teacher network during the training process.
 Unlike the topics, word embeddings encode syntactic and semantic relatedness in fine-granularity and therefore, do not capture thematic structures.
In this work, we take an empirical approach to questioning the conventional wisdom of not using common regularizations.
 Specifically, we design a heuristic region growing method based on the Potts model (Potts, 1952), as well as an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of the markov random field (MRF) (Boykov et al., 1998).
 First, they need an additional module, a generative model, in addition to a classifier.
 This compensation considers the divergence of the latent variable corresponding to primitive skills and that for transitional skills.
 Diverse: Capture a rich range of useful programming problems from easy to hard.
 By synergistically combining deep learning with fluid dynamics, we are able to inpaint data in large and irregular areas.
 Other saturating activations like hyperbolic tangent and sigmoid commonly applied in recurrent neural networks may benefit from this resolution as well.
 Note that the aforementioned weight pruning techniques are built on different sparsity-promoting regularization schemes (Han et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2016), e.g, lasso regression (`1 regularization) and ridge regression (`2 regularization).
 We base our model on the framework of Generative Query Networks (GQN) (Eslami et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2018).

 For complex samples like images, this will be a crude measure of similarity.
 It is important to analyze the distributional stability of one layer by measuring the change of the distributions.
 Finally, we introduce a new shape loss on the model predictions that constrains the pairwisedistances between objects and object parts and greatly improves shape preservation and the stability of trajectories over long-time horizons.
 Since these nodes may have very few or even no links to other nodes, it would be difficult and even impossible for them to learn similar feature representations as other same-class nodes, which is an intrinsic limitation of the 1-D graph convolution that is commonly adopted in existing models.
 As a result, explanations that optimize upon such evaluations often omit important dark objects and the pertinent negative features in the image, which is the part of the image that does not contain object but is crucial to the prediction (Dhurandhar et al., 2018).
 To make the learning possible, we make the assumption that natural images are formed by a differentiable renderer.
 Negative samples can be obtained from an auxiliary dataset, or — to remain completely in the unsupervised setting — from a generative model trained on the ground truth distribution itself.
 An extreme version of the above-mentioned methods are Progressive neural networks (Rusu et al., (2016)) and Pathnets (Fernando et al., (2017)) that directly freeze important pathways in neural networks.
 At each generation, a gene is an independent binary variable with fixed probability of 1.
 We do this by learning a transformation that attempts to remove the lexical-semantic information in a sentence, while trying to preserve structural properties.
 All these studies provide certain explanations about why neural networks exhibit spectral bias in real tasks.
 Despitetheir strong theoretical guarantees, SVRG-like algorithms have seen limited success in training deep learning models (Defazio & Bottou, 2018).
To compress some data x with our trained model, instead of selecting z deterministically and then coding it, we map x to the posterior q(z |x) and use it to code a sample from it, using an adapted version of the importance sampling algorithm proposed by Havasi et al., (2018).
 For example, in classification problems, if we were to partition the feature space by class, then we might expect the set corrresponding to any given class to consist of the union of a few contiguous regions with fairly smooth boundaries.
 There also exist some work using the counts of state-action pairs to design their exploration techniques, such as explicit explore or exploit (E3) (Kearns & Singh, 2002), R-Max Brafman & Tennenholtz (2002), UCRL (Auer & Ortner, 2006), UCAGG (Ortner, 2013).
The obtained embeddings reflect an action’s general utility, and can be used as action representations in the downstream task of reinforcement learning.
 Our contributions are:
 The third step introduces a noise resistant version of AdaBoost which relies on the noise and error rate estimated in step 2.
 Predicting the full-state may result in a latent state representation which contains information irrelevant to planning.
 Within each attack setting, we evaluate attack strategies as appending an additional adversarial sentence or adding scatter of adversarial words to a paragraph, to evaluate the quantitative attack effectiveness.
 Besides, the exploration boundary will be expanded further as more and more new states are discovered.
 The problems of VAE are the obstacles of putting the GAN encoder in the right way either.
 And the objective function of multi-task learning can further enhance the quality of the learned task dependency.
 Clearly, this raises privacy and legal concerns since either the source domain or the target domains need to send their sensitive data (i.g,, sonograms) to each other to perform uDA.
The observed undersensitivity correlates negatively with standard performance metrics (EM/F1), suggesting that this phenomenon – where present – is a reflection of a model’s lack of question comprehension.
 The best method outperforms current ones by 14% on average.
 Our results show that XD reaches the same or better results than multilingual tuning alone, depending on language.
 These include the first results for HDBO with black-box constraints.
 The official ICD guidelines provide each code a short text description and a hierarchical tree structure on all the ICD codes (ICD-9 Guidelines).
 Most of these works focus on learning an interpolator.
 Using these tricks, Goyal et al., (2017) was able to drastically reduce the training time of ResNet-50 model from 29 hours to 1 hour using a batch size of 8192.
When learning under label noise, the network receives noisy updates and hence fluctuates strongly.
Early works on neural QG did not take into account the answer information when generating a question.
 The significancy of this result is that the cost of learning the shared representation decreases with a factor O(1/√T), where T is the number of tasks for many function approximator hypothesis classes.
 By taking advantages of both DGM and GCN, Wang et al., (2019) and Zhang & Lee (2019) incorporate permutation loss instead of displacement loss in (Zanfir & Sminchisescu, 2018), with notable improvement across both synthetic and real data.
 Given an input graph, GIL attempts to infer the unlabeled nodes from those observed nodes by building between-node relations.
We motivate this approach theoretically, by showing that it implements a regularized variant of BC that learns long-horizon imitation by (a) imposing a sparsity prior on the reward function implied by the imitation policy, and (b) incorporating information about the state transition dynamics into the imitation policy.
 Besides the usage of oblivious decision tables, another important design choice is the recent entmax transformation (Peters et al., 2019), which effectively performs a ”soft” splitting feature choice in decision trees inside the NODE architecture.
 By training peer-networks with such on-line soft pseudo labels on the target domain, the learned feature representations can be iteratively improved to provide more accurate soft pseudo labels, which, in turn, further improves the discriminativeness of learned feature representations.
Several other methods have been introduced to reduce overestimation bias, without fully moving towards underestimation.
 First, we analyze the federated domain adaptation problem from a theoretical perspective and provide a generalization bound.
 Dynamic computation poses a challenge for self-attention because omitted layers in prior time-steps may be required in the future.
 Some popular regularizers like SCAD (Fan & Li, 2001), MDP (Zhang et al., 2010) and Trimmed `1 (Yun et al., 2019) use a piece-wise formulation to mitigate the proportional scaling problem of `1.
In addition to this, we observed that the ranking by quality of candidate architectures produced by the NAS algorithms during the search does not reflect the true performance of these architectures in the evaluation phase.
 This makes the DPP an ideal tool for modeling the diversity within a set.
 In the context of NN, it is used to (i) promote a sparse neural network (SNN) to alleviate overfitting and to allow a better generalization, (ii) accelerate the training process, and (iii) prune the network to reduce its complexity, see Louizos et al., (2018) and Gale et al., (2019).
 LAMOL is inspired by the data-based approach for LLL in which a generator learns to generate samples in previous tasks (middle of Figure 1) (Hanul Shin & Kim, 2017; Kemker & Kanan, 2017).
 The most related work is M3RL (Shu & Tian, 2019) where the leader assigns goals and bonuses by using a simple attention mechanism (summing/averaging the features together) and mind (behaviors) tracking to predict the followers’ behaviors and makes response to the followers’ behaviors.
 Nodes x and y have the same degree in three significantly different graphs: a tree, a grid and a clique.
 This type of methods is to convert DPP into a simpler format which can ease and stabilize the computation.
 When a new task arrives, it queries the meta-knowledge graph and quickly attends to the most relevant entities (vertices), and then takes advantage of the relational knowledge structures between them to boost the learning effectiveness with the limited training data.
 AdVIL is a black-box inference and learning method that partly solves the two problems of NVIL and retains the advantages of NVIL at the same time.
First, all the parameters, including weights, bias, activations, partial results that eventually accumulate to an activation, and even the scaling factors, which are indispensable for low-precision networks like binary and ternary representation, must be quantized into low bitwidth integers as required by the underlying specialized hardware.
 This task can be achieved by asking experts to exhaustively annotate each metastases region in each image.
 This order-sensitivity could be highly problematic if fairness across tasks is important (e.g, disease diagnosis).
 We introduce for each neuron one binary parameter controlling whether or not to adapt, and two parameters to control the magnitude of adaptation.
 In Figure 1(top), an auxiliary Neural Network (NN) gl,c learns p(y = c|fl(x)), which is the probability that the layer l features of the whitebox model, extracted from input image x, belong to class c.
Our Contributions.
 These mobile devices are very sensitive to the bit-width of fixed-point MAC operations and memory access during inferences due to their limited battery lifetime and hardware resources.
1The popular NAS architectures refer to the best architectures generated by state-of-the-art (SOTA) NAS algorithms throughout the paper.
 However, they separate the planning algorithm from the inference of the state.
Ranking Policy Gradient (RPG) that directly optimizes relative action values to maximize the return is a policy gradient method.
 Now, an interesting question is whether the features in the distribution of softmax could be better utilized.
How to design quantization levels with consideration for both the computational efficiency and the distribution of weights? Most of the existing quantization approaches (Cai et al., 2017; Gong et al., 2019) use uniform quantization although non-uniform quantization can usually achieve betteraccuracy (Zhu et al., 2016).
 The knowledge encoded in the shuffled feature is consistent with the knowledge in the original feature.
 Given this 3D reconstruction and the set of images of the video, we are ableto train our pipeline in a self-supervised manner.
 (2)A commonly adopted approach to solving (2) is the the Gradient Descent based Adversarial Training (GDAT) method.
 Mcfall failed to be re-elected though being unopposed.
 It does not use backpropagation, so it can be run on CPUs only.
 By introducing a meta network to moderate the operations of the program memory, our model, henceforth referred to as Neural Stored-program Memory (NSM), can learn to switch the programs/weights in the controller network appropriately, adapting to different functionalities aligning with different parts of a sequential task, or different tasks in continual and few-shot learning.
 The subgoals break the problem into short horizon subsegments each with some useful cost signal coming from the next subgoal image.
 Second, online learning is not common due to safety and efficiency concerns.
 After T iterations, each node can carry structure information from its T -hop neighborhood (Gilmer et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018a).
 Although this improvement is usually less significant than it resulted by AT methods, mixup-trained models can keep state-of-the-art performance on the clean inputs; meanwhile, the mixup training is computationally more efficient than AT.
while we focus on the complementary strategy to exploit the labeled data in hand more efficiently.
Finally, the learning dynamics of nonlinear models have been studied as well.
Our work provides the following contributions.
 An arrow of time should therefore quantify the amount of disorder in the environment, analogous to the entropy for isolated thermodynamical systems.
 The zebrafish is an excellent model organism for vertebrates, including humans, due to the following four reasons: The genetic codes of humans and zebrafish are about 70% orthologue (Howe et al., (2013)).
 As mentioned earlier, there are two challenges associated with estimating treatment effects:(i) The fact that counterfactual outcomes are unobservable (i.g,, not present in any training data) makes estimating treatment effects more difficult than the generalization problem in the supervised learning paradigm.
 In all ofthese domains, our method improves over the baseline.
 Unfortunately, as pointed out by works Nagarajan & Kolter (2017); Khayatkhoei et al., (2018); Xiao et al., (2018), the transport maps may be discontinuous when there are multiple modes in the data distribution.
 This scalar measures how strongly the network perceives a 3-way interaction involving i, j, k. order is alphabetical.
 While the combination of demonstrations and reinforcement has been studied extensively in single task problems (Kober et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2018; Rajeswaran et al., 2018; Le et al., 2018), this combination is particularly important in meta-learning contexts where few-shot learning of new tasks is simply not possible without demonstrations.
 Under recommended MOT configurations in practice (Zhu et al., 2018) and normal measurement noise levels, we find that our attack can succeed with successful AEs on as few as one frame, and 2 to 3 consecutive frames on average.
 Therefore, many methods treat samples with small loss as clean ones (Jiang et al., 2018; Arazo et al., 2019).
 Moreover, Tsipras et al., (2019); Zhang et al., (2019) demonstrated that adversarial robustness may be inherently at odds with natural accuracy.
To overcome the first challenge, we tailor operations of DNN to make the succeeding computation at the cloud invariant to feature rotations, i.g,, the DNN can correctly handle the feature and preserve the rotated angle in the output.
To address the non-acceleration of SGD+Nesterov, we introduce an additional compensation term to allow convergence for the same range of step sizes as SGD.
 This also confirms the intuition that early layers in a convolutional network amounts to low-level feature extractors, analogous to earlyconv1 conv2 conv3 conv4 conv5 020406080 100 % su pe rv ise d pe rfo rm an ceLinear Classifier on ImageNetRandom RotNet 1-RotNet BiGAN 1-BiGAN DeepCluster 1-DeepClusterFigure 1: Single-image self-supervision.
 However, there currently seems to be no quantitative evidence that such approaches will lead to improved disentanglement on the metrics and data sets considered in this paper.
Intriguingly, this behavior is not consistent across data sets, as other ones correctly tend to produce likelihoods lower than the ones of the training data (see the example of TrafficSign in fig.  1).
 Through curriculum learning where we adapt txt2π trained on simpler tasks to more complex tasks, we obtain agents that generalise to tasks with natural language documents that require five hops of reasoning between the goal, document, and environment observations.
 Training a graph classifier entails identifying what constitutes a class, i.g,, finding properties shared by graphs in one class but not the other, and then deciding whether new graphs abide to said learned properties.
 We use “incremental domain adaptation” in this paper to emphasize that our domain is not changed continuously.few steps of gradient updates does transfer quickly, but it suffers from the catastrophic forgetting problem (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017).
 For example, training a self-driving car to successfully do flips might be challenging and novel, but it would not be particularly beneficial.
With respect to token identifiability, in Section 4, we devise an experimental setting where we probe the hypothesis that contextual word embeddings maintain their identity as they pass through successive layers of a transformer.
 As we can see, while both reward surface is not smooth with respect to action trajectory.
 This algorithm does not use any additional environment interactions, and we show that it empirically helps correct errors of the behavioral cloning policy.
 Our analysis shows that these updates can amplify a component in an escape direction of the saddle points.
 Qualitatively, the adversaries fall to the ground in contorted positions, as illustrated in Figure 1, rather than learning to run, kick or block like normal opponents.
 To our knowledge, flow-based models have been applied only to generation of non-temporal data, such as images (Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018), and to audio sequences (Prenger et al., 2018).
 A filter’s output should be sensitive to and “detect” perturbations of large magnitude.
 Models trained with this objective demonstrates much stronger fact completion performance for most relations we test on.
 For instance, it will not generalize to a different viewpoint of the same object or paraphrasing in natural language processing tasks.
 Inspired by recent work on learning representations of code (Allamanis et al., 2017), our approach is distinguished by two aspects.
 These searched branches are adaptively aggregated for the final prediction.
 The generator learns to map a sample from a latent space to some distribution to increase the classification errors of the discriminator.
 First, their algorithms are general and do not utilize the underlying favorable property of the the objective function induced by an overparameterized deep neural network, which prevents them from designing better algorithms with faster convergence.
 We mainly leverage the recent randomized smoothing technique (Cohen et al., 2019).
We extend this detection mechanism to standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and show its effectiveness against black box and white box attacks on three image datasets; MNIST, FashionMNIST and SVHN.
Our specific contributions are:
 Therefore, solving a PO task is segregated into a representation learning problem and a fully observable RL problem.
The proposed Population-guided Parallel Policy Search (P3S) learning method can be applied to any off-policy RL algorithms and implementation is easy.
 However, the models they introduced were mainly studied by means of experiments with human participants, in which the compositional languages is favored by the participants because human brain favors structure.
 However, gradient information is localized and sometimes it is misleading.
 Apparently, the main challenge here is how to exploit such a large-scale test set under the constraint of very limited budgets for human labeling, knowing that collecting ground-truth labels for all images is extremely difficult, if not impossible.
 In finite-horizon settings, there are straightforward definitions for both regret and sample complexity; the latter is defined as the number of samples needed before the policy becomes near optimal.
 These architectures are thus difficult to analyze mathematically and involve heavy calculations.
 Specifically, we reduce the number of neurons in layer i by constructing a coreset of neurons in this layer that provably approximates the output of neurons in layer i + 1 and discarding the rest.
The proposed theorem is proved in three stages: (1) we prove that neural networks with one hidden layer and two-piece linear activations have spurious local minima; (2) we extend the conditions to neural networks with arbitrary hidden layers and two-piece linear activations; and (3) we further extend the conditions to neural networks with arbitrary depth and arbitrary piecewise linear activations.
 The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews neccesary preliminaries.
The asynchronous parallel (ASP) policy alleviates the straggling problem by allowing each worker to run immediately after it pushes its gradients.
 However, they considered the entity relations on the pixel-level of raw visual data, which ignores the natural property of the influence of actions between agents.
 The Pose2Pose network enables guided human-pose generation for a specific trained domain (e.g, a tennis player, a dancer, etc.), where guiding takes the form of 2D motion controls, while the Pose2Frame network allows the incorporation of a photo-realistic generated character into a desired environment.
 In LEC, the network is first trained on the entire training set for a while and then trained on the intersection of small-loss examples of the ensemble of perturbed networks.
 The smoothed classifier gk(x) predicts the k labels with the largest probabilities pi’s for the example x.
 Exactly how the network generalises to those novel state-action pairs is unknown, and thus it is unclear whether those estimates are optimistic when compared to nearby visited state-action pairs.
 It is previously justified as adapting receptive field, or what we phrase as the “theoretical receptive field”, that defines which input pixels can contribute to the final output.
 However, this collapses an ensemble of conditional distributions over classes into a single point-estimate conditional distribution over classes.
 Prior works have shown that gradient staleness severely hinders the convergence process by reaching reduced final accuracy (Chen et al., 2016; Cui et al., 2016).
 Implementing such a penalty can be expensive, and does not provide any guarantees.
 We find that this function leads to a high quality fit and extrapolation.
 Some systems have also “neuralized” KB reasoning, but to date only over small KBs: this approach is natural when answers are naturally constrained to depend on a small set of facts (e.g, a single table (Zhong et al., 2017; Gupta & Lewis, 2018)), but more generally requires coupling a learner with some (non-differentiable) mechanism to retrieve an appropriate small question-dependent subset of the KB as in (Sun et al., 2018; 2019).
 Unlike existing neural architectures, CLNs can represent a learned SMT formula explicitly in its structure and thus allow us to precisely extract the exact formula from a trained model.
 The datasets used are CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SPORT8, MIT67 and FLOWERS102.
 The seconddrawback of existing video prediction models is that they cannot efficiently take advantage of 3D convolutions, as that would make these already cumbersome architectures even larger.
 These relationships are represented by the order graph.
 Inspired by the datasets extracted from standardized examinations (Lai et al., 2017; Clark et al., 2018), we build a dataset by selecting such logical reasoning questions from standardized exams such as GMAT 2 and LSAT 3.
 AssembleNet is a ‘family’ of learnable architectures; they provide a generic approach to learn connectivity among feature representations across input modalities, while being optimized for the target task.
 For certain choices of parameters, our formulation naturally leads to the minimization of the entropy regularized Wasserstein distance between representations.
 All in all, much of the attention around VAEs is still directed towards “fixing” the aforementioned drawbacks associated with them.
Based on the above observation, in this paper, we aim to automatically design the computation allocation of backbone for object detectors.
 For example we could optimize for states in which the agent sees the only option as being to slam on the brakes; or states in which the agent expects to score exceptionally low.
These issues easily generate doubts and confusion among practitioners that need a fully transparent and reproducible experimental setting.
 Such property arises, for instance, in support vector machines as well as other regularized learning problems, and it is wellknown that the vanilla OGD with an appropriately chosen step size enjoys a much better O(log T ) regret bound for strongly convex functions (Hazan et al., 2007).
Utilizing this super-class information, we then build a graph of graphs called a super-graph.
• Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL, Russell (1998); Ng et al., (2000); Finn et al., (2016); Levine & Koltun (2012)).
The target-agnostic attack can be adopted in scenarios where fingerprint, face, or voice is used for authentication/verification.
 The knowledge encoder has nothing to do with dialogues, and thus can be pre-trained with the plain text.
 Third, these branch-level representations∗Work done during an internship at Salesforce Research Asia, Singapore.
 Moreover, most existing approaches, including the ones based on solving the HJB and FP equations, require knowing the model of dynamics (Bardi and Priuli, 2014), or having the access to a simulator, which generates the next state given any state-action pair and aggregated effect of the population (Guo et al., 2019), which is often unavailable in practice.
 However, the scalability of this approach remains an issue, especially for complete methods.
We believe such solutions could be useful for social media platforms, photo attestation services, or insurance companies, which may exploit asymmetric compression setups and acquire photos from smart-phones in analysis-friendly formats.
Inspired by our analysis results, we propose a new variant of Adam, called Rectified Adam (RAdam), which explicitly rectifies the variance of the adaptive learning rate based on derivations.
 All of these applications avoid the need for manually designed reward functions, demonstrations, or user-provided examples, and involve minimal modification to existing deep RL algorithms.
 In experiments, k is often simply kept fixed between meta-training and meta-testing, but in real-world usage, one cannot expect to know beforehand the amount of support data from unseen tasks during deployment.
 This corresponds to fitting a probability distribution pθ(x) with parameters θ to the data.
 Although these methods provide small gains in the quality-diversity trade-off they have other computational limitations.
 The proposed method exploits a known observation that a well-trained deep network can converge to significantly different sets of parameters across multiple trainings, due to factors such as different parameter initializations and different choices of mini-batches.
 For example, if the training dataset consists of centered dogs and daises, the same may be the case in GAN-generated images.
Current AL techniques that use reinforcement learning (Konyushkova et al., 2018; Fang et al., 2017; Woodward & Finn, 2016; Pang et al., 2018; Padmakumar et al., 2018; Bachman et al., 2017) focus on labelling one sample per step until a budget of labels is met.
 We organize the related work in two themes, namely Adversarial Example Generation and Sign-Based Optimization.
 This assumption, however, only holds for the “normal class” in AD, but is crucially invalid for the “anomaly class” since anomalies are not necessarily similar to one another.
Much of the theoretical analysis of optimization algorithms focuses on asymptotic convergence and optimality (Robbins & Monro, 1951; Nemirovski et al., 2009; Bottou et al., 2018), which implicitly makes use of an infinite compute budget.
 In contrast to compact lowerdimensional ANN-esque representations that typically lead to decreased representational power, a key facet of our higher dimensional sparse embeddings is that they can have the same representational capacity as the initial dense embeddings.
The second approach is the so-called TD with centering (CTD) algorithm proposed in Korda and La (2015), which introduces the variance reduction idea to the original TD learning algorithm.
 Accordingly, there is no guarantee that the learned policy will recover the desired target distribution.
 We can simply normalize it by the sum of the complexities of the weights (often measured by the norms or the covering number) and obtain a bound of the following form:Test error .
 Our core contributions are:
Our contributions in this paper are as follows:
 Therefore, it is practically helpful to provide tools to users who wish to utilize pre-trained models while mitigating such adversarial threats.
However, despite these serious risks, privacy-preserving meta-learning has remained largely an unstudied problem.
 However, we are eventually after models that can generalize to entirely new distributions (e.g, datasets).
 Ideally speaking, the algorithm should have a high recall; otherwise, many relevant documents won’t even be considered in the scoring phase.
 To accomplish this, we first train a model to forecast expert trajectories with a density function, which can score trajectories and plans by how likely they are to come from the expert.
 We find this holds for a variety of network architectures proposed in previous literature.
In this paper, we follow the same optimization formulation of (Cheng et al., 2019) which has the advantage of smoothness, but instead of using finite differences to estimate the magnitude of directional derivative, we propose to evaluate its sign using only a single query.
The contributions of our work are as follows:
 Based on extensive experiments, we report a prominent phenomenon that although each adversarial party is only implanted with a local trigger pattern via DBA, their assembled pattern (i.g,, global trigger) attains significantly better attack performance on the global model compared with the centralized attack.
 Instead of designing variance reduced and faster converging algorithms by hand as in Liu et al., (2018a;b), we replace parameter update rule as well as guided sampling rule for query directions with learned recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
Contributions.
 In other words, given , δ ∈ R>0, we aim to obtain probably approximately correct (PAC) confidence sets CT (x) ⊆ Y satisfying the guaranteePZval∼Dn ( P(x,y)∼D(y ∈ CT (x)) ≥ 1− ) ≥ 1− δ.
 Intuitively, small values make a small contribution to the DNN’s output; thus approximating them in a low precision is reasonable.
 The modules we define are probabilistic and differentiable, which lets us maintain uncertainty about intermediate decisions and train the entire model via end-to-end differentiability.
 Consequently, not only can VHE-raster-scan-GAN generate vivid high-resolution images with better details, but also build interpretable hierarchical semantic-visual relationships between the generated images and texts.
 The starting point of T-NAS is inspired by recent meta-learning methods (Finn et al., 2017; Antoniou et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019), especially Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) (Finn et al., 2017), where a model learns the meta-weights that are able to adapt to a new task through a few gradient steps.
 There are 237 templates in Zork1, each with up to two blanks, yielding a template-action space of size1Code available at github.KG-A2CO(237 × 6972) = 1.15× 108.
comthe process of encoding, transitioning via the latent dynamics, and then decoding, to adhere to the true observation dynamics.
Our FSNet is novel with the following contributions:
 In this paper, we propose COMPGCN, a novel GCN framework for multi-relational graphs which systematically leverages entity-relation composition operations from knowledge graph embedding techniques.
 Although GraN-DAG is general enough to deal with a large variety of parametric families of conditional probability distributions, our experiments focus on the special case of nonlinear Gaussian additive noise models since, under specific assumptions, it provides appealing theoretical guarantees easing the comparison to other graph search procedures (see Section 2.2 & 3.3).
 For completeness, we remark that the notion of local elasticity seems related to influence functions on the surface (Koh & Liang, 2017).
3. Since network parameters are updated proportionally to gradients, they change faster in the direction of stronger gradients.
 To overcome this limitation we introduced a new task, called Paired Associative Inference (PAI - see below), which is derived from the neuroscientific literature (Bunsey & Eichenbaum, 1996; Banino et al., 2016).
 Several non- and semi-autoregressive approaches aim to generate tokens of the target language independently (Gu et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018; Kaiser et al., 2018).
 This is good, because, by virtue of the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem, we can now maintain fidelity of discrete samples with respect to continuous time dynamics, in contrast to conventional ODEs (α = 0).
 While vanilla BN uses the statistics computed over the whole training data instead of batch of samples when training finished.
 There are M agents interacting with the same bandit instance in a synchronized fashion.
 Sleep reactivation, or replay, serves to strengthen synapses involved in a learned task through local synaptic plasticity, such as Spike Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP).
 (In fact, they proved that, when Φ is symmetric and has negative eigenvalues, GD for linear ResNets with zero-initialization does not converge.) Arora et al., (2019a) showed that GD converges under substantially weaker conditions, which can be satisfied by random initialization schemes.
Contribitions: Our primary technical contribution is the Fixed Grouping Layer (FGL).
 While Ueffing (2006) and Zhang & Zong (2016) explored self-training in statistical and neural machine translation, only relatively limited gains were reported and, to the best of our knowledge, it is still unclear what makes self-training work.
 We extend the well-known kernel estimator in Diggle (1985) to the multivariate case.
 The graph neural network itself requires handling a variety of hyperedge types—some with variable numbers of arguments—for which we define appropriate graph propagation operators.
 Therefore, the trained speech encoder from the inference step is reused to output a pseudo conditional label that is used to extract meaningful information relevant to the corresponding face.
 At test time, our model forms plausible 3D completions of the scene given RGB-D video streams or even a single RGB-D image as input: it learns to fill in information behind occlusions, and infer the 3D extents of objects.
Specifically, we first train models to learn representations with different sampling strategies, including the standard instance-based sampling, class-balanced sampling and a mixture of them.
Model misspecification: For the purpose of this paper, we refer to an agent that is trained in one environment and performs in a different, perturbed version of the environment (as in the above examples) as model misspecification.
 We propose to use the predicted mean and variance of the latent distributions to characterize the importance of each parameter.
 Since we do not know the clean distribution, we want our model to perform well for the worst case estimate of the clean distribution in some constrained set.
 For example, in lifelong learning, a natural idea is to use a separate ensemble member for each task, adaptively growing the total number of parameters by creating a new independent setof weights for each new task.
 This issue of an imperfect inverse was also found to be the ”bottleneck” of TP in practice (Bartunov et al., 2018).
 Ruthotto & Haber (2018) derived new CNNs: parabolic and hyperbolic CNNs based on ResNet (He et al., 2016) architecture motivated by PDE theory.
 However, the gradients of the expected reward in RL often suffer from high Monte Carlo (MC) estimation variance, due to noisy and/or sparse rewards and the large action space that grows exponentially with the sequence length.
 Let xk+1 := xk − 1L∇f(xk).
 f Progressive Net: propagating combined feature maps via lateral connections (Rusu et al., 2016).
 In reality, it may take a very long time for a trajectory to reach the stationary distribution, which may be impractical due to various reasons like costs and missing data.
 Our proposed scheme capitalizes on the understanding that most GNNs perform a special form of Laplacian smoothing, which makes node features more similar to one another.
 Let xi be the i-th training example and fpθ, ¨q represent the neural net.
 However, the control over the image generation is often limited to discrete factors and requires both labels and an encoder model.
Very recently, in the complete dictionary learning1 setting, a novel global approach has been suggested in Zhai et al., (2019a;b) that presents a formulation which can efficiently recover the sparse signal matrix X once and for all.
 2For example, a Samsung dishwasher may have a different energy pattern from that of a Kenmore dishwasher.
Our key observation is that the dominance of f (1) is deduced from comparing the upper bounds— rather than the actual values—of f (k)W0,W(x).
∗The previous versions of this work were published in AAAI 2019 workshop on RLG and ICML 2019 workshop on RWSDM.
Augmenting an existing Android layout synthesizer In this work we apply our approach to a state-of-the-art synthesizer, called InferUI (Bielik et al., 2018), that creates an Android layout program which represents the implementation of a user interface.
Summary of numerical experiments.
 The former contributes to improving the classification accuracy by positive sampling, whereas the latter discourages the algorithm from constructing similar decision trees by negative sampling.
 • Explicit regularization with initial models matters for transfer learning performance (Liet al., 2018; 2019).
 RL implemented preliminary experiments and multi-attribute control, and cleaned and coordinated release of the code.
 Henzler et al., (2019) recently proposed unsupervised single-view voxel reconstruction on natural images, but the resolution is limited due to the memory constraint.
While under-sensitivity has been demonstrated for several NLP tasks (Feng et al., 2018), we chose to study the use case of natural language inference (NLI) (Dagan et al., 2006; Bowman et al., 2015) in particular as a representative task: sequences are comparatively short, datasets large, and the label complexity is small.
 This method offers a new way to look at improving robustness without relying on adversarial examples during training.
 Specifically, we show that robustness certificates for smoothed classifiers can be obtained by solving a small convex optimization problem when allowed adversarial perturbations can be characterized via divergence-based bounds on the smoothing measure.
 These objective functions have been used successfully in recent years for density estimation and representation learning, especially in self-supervised settings.
Therefore, we propose Human-Independent Symbolic Superoptimization (HISS), a reinforcement learning framework for symbolic superoptimization that is completely independent of human knowledge.
 We augment the data of each min-batch with various adversarial policies in parallel, rather than the same data augmentation taken in batch augmentation (BA) (Hoffer et al., 2019).
 The learned noise generator then can be used to perturb instances for generalization at meta-test time.
 This shortcoming motivated the use of equalized odds notion Hardt et al., (2016) which requires that the model output is conditionally independent of sensitive attributes given the ground-truth label.
 Users often resort to using Euclidean or other hand-crafted cost functions, which could give misleading mappings.
 Moreover, in real-world scenarios, allocated budgets can change quickly; we would like to be able to find a good network in a matter of minutes, not hours or days.
 Our best attack method, SI-NI-TI-DIM (Scale-Invariant Nesterov Iterative FGSM integrated with translation-invariant diverse input method), reaches an average success rate of 93.5% against adversarially trained models under the black-box setting.
Despite the prominent role of complexity measures in studying generalization, the empirical evaluation of these measures is usually limited to a few models, often on toy problems.
We resolve several particular challenges in verifying Transformers.
(ii) Adding a single linear transmission layer (i.g,,X 7→ 11TX) to PointNet makes it equivariant universal.
Large batch SGD.
 Similar to the reasoning above, this condition would imply thatµ = F∗ν and Df ( F∗ν‖µ) = 0.
 Overall, our contributions are the following:
 The model expansion (i.g,, adding moreexperts) is governed by the Bayesian nonparametric framework, which determines the model complexity by the data, as opposed to the parametric methods that fix the model complexity before training.
 This makes calibration troublesome because of the lack of ground truth negatives.
 We refer to this regularization as Sparsity Normalization, and show that it effectively deals away with the VSP, resulting in significant improvements in both the performance and the stability of training neural networks.
 The term “DropEdge” refers to randomly dropping out certain rate of edges of the input graph for each training time.
 In addition to the attentional mechanism, we have found that the choice of the normalization function has a significant impact on the quality of the transformed results for various datasets with different amounts of change in shape and texture.
Several works in recent literature that successfully learn conditional architectures, for example, ConvNet-AIG (Veit & Belongie, 2018) and dynamic channel pruning (Gao et al., 2018).
Naively, the number of parameters of a distribution over an n-choose-k problem scales factorially, which is intractable for all practical purposes.
Our contribution.
 This is too slow to be broadly useful in a general-purpose production compiler.
 This results in navigation policies that can work with raw sensory inputs such as RGB images, are robust to state estimation errors, and leverage regularities of real world layout.
 The individual models in these ensembles are restricted to full precision DNN models, i.g,, models utilizing 32 bits of numerical precision to represent different data-structures.
 Surprisingly, as we show, B-BERT is cross-lingual even when there is absolutely no word-piece overlap.
 Similar to scene-mixture models, previous models in this class show scalability issues as objects are processed sequentially.
 The graph is embedded into the 2-variate normal distributions, which are represented by a σ ellipse (boundary of 1 standard deviation around mean µ).
 Once the unconstrained LQR is computed, the predictive model is pre-stabilised using a linear state-feedback controller to improve the conditioning of the QP and the numerical accuracy of the MPC solution and gradients.
 As these findings point out some deficiencies of current decentralized training schemes (and are not particular to our scheme) we think that reporting these results is a helpful contribution to the community to spur further research on decentralized training schemes that scale to large number of peers.
 Hence it is important and necessary to have a systematic methodology to design non-trivial adversarial attacks, which can efficiently and effectively discover the vulnerabilities of deep RL agents – this is indeed the motivation of this work.
Contributions.
 In detail, EMP includes a pre-estimation step using certain parametric model to learn a “virtual” policy (we call it the mixture policy and formally define it in Section 4).
This paper makes three novel contributions.
Our approach to these problems combines demonstrations with off-policy, recurrent Q-learning in a way that allows us to make very efficient use of the available data.
 The difference is that the latter restricts the learning of meta-parameters to point estimates.
Our contributions are:
 In this setting, the class label for each image in the training set is given.
Our contributions are the following:
 Over time, the reward model becomes more reliable and can be used as a cheap surrogate, similar to Bayesian optimization methods (Shahriari et al., 2015).
 However, learning the effective dimensionality of the latent search space can be challenging by itself, and has not been investigated by the prior works to the best of our knowledge.
 This is the problem scope we focus on in this work: learning to quickly infer and adapt to varying hierarchical tasks with multiple goals and complex subtask dependencies.
 Note that RAPP falls back to the ordinary reconstruction-based method if we only aggregate input values before the input layer and the reconstructed values at the output layer.
 We observe that the two problems share an important common thread regarding their computational model, which both evolve Lagrangian particles in an Eulerian space guided by the first principle of energy minimization.
 In this way, the linguistic aspects (Elman, 1990) are explicitly captured during the pre-training procedure.
Overall, we make the following contributions:
 Many more insights can be gained if we understand the behavior of the prediction loss and model complexity with varying β, and how they depend on the dataset.
We revisit the architectures of state-of-the-art networks (Howard et al., (2019); Tan & Le (2019b); He et al., (2016)) and discover a commonly used building structure: convolution - channel-wise operation - convolution.
 For more general problems, MI is challenging to analytically compute or estimate from samples.
 It stretches the bottleneck to introduce more dependency capturing capability for the attention layer, and then shrink the embedding size to reduce the total computation amount while maintaining the same performance.
 For univariate functions f : R → R, corresponding to networks with a single one-dimensional input and a single output, Savarese et al., obtained a crisp and precise characterization of the representational cost, showing that minimizing overall Euclidean norm of the weights is equivalent to fitting a function by controlling:max (∫ |f ′′(x)|dx, |f ′(−∞) + f ′(+∞)| ) .
Our contributions are as follows:
com †Work partially done while visiting Baidu Researchin instruction learning and machine translation tasks.
To address the issues, we propose a novel approach with four main features: 1) State-based.
 Having learned the geometry of wheels from airplanes should help recognize wheels for cars and swivel chairs.
In this work, we propose unrestricted attack strategies that explicitly manipulate semantic visual representations to generate natural-looking adversarial examples that are “far” from the original image in tems of the Lp norm distance.
 We suspect this might be the reason that applying both does not lead to overlaid gain.
Construction of transport mappings.
 Scaling up the object-attention capacity is an important problem because it allows us to maximize the modern parallel computation that can maximize search capacity.
 Specifically, in many cases we observe <1% difference between attacks that use the full range ofposteriors (blue line in fig.
 As an additional benefit, in contrast to previous strategies for untying the source and target streams (Rozantsev et al., 2018; 2019), our formulation naturally extends to more than two domains.
 Our contributions involve Bingham parameter learning using backpropagation through a Gram-Schmidt method to ensure orthonormalization, efficient approximate evaluation of the normalization constant of the Bingham distribution from a lookup table, and backpropagating through an interpolation scheme during learning.
 Although we easily recognize objects independently of their position of appearance, a large corpus of experimental research has shown that this is not always the case for in-plane rotations.
 Similarly, (Esser et al., 2019) learned the stepsize using gradient descent.
 We propose a probabilistic version of a decision tree that has these properties.
 Specifically, it allows us to follow the full trajectory of architectures found by arbitrary one-shot NAS methods at each search epoch without the need for retraining them individually, allowing for a careful and statistically sound analysis (Section 3).
 These methods have a sound Bayesian justification, but training them is both difficult and carries an accuracy penalty, particularly for networks with convolutional architectures (Osawa et al., 2019).
 These existing normbased complexity measures depend on the number of hidden units of the network explicitly and thus can not explain why neural networks generalize so well in practice, despite that they operate in an overparametrized setting (Zhang et al., 2017).
 Cache side-channel attacks have especially been shown as practical in cloud computing for stealing sensitive information, such as cryptographic keys (Liu et al., 2015).
 Spike-based SNN training reduces the overall latency by ∼10× (for instance, 200 − 250 time steps required to process an input (Lee et al., 2019)) but requires more training effort (in terms of total training iterations) than conversion approaches.
 MMA-H is designed with streaming systems in mind where the attention span must be limited.
 To this end, we consider a number of learning tasks in vision, including unsupervised, self-supervised and transfer learning.
 The removal of unnecessary compute not only makes CNNs smaller in size but also reduces computational costs while minimizing possible accuracy degradations.
 For instance, an initial work of Gregor and LeCun’s (2010) takes the inspiration from ISTA and develops an approximator named learned ISTA (LISTA), which is structurally similar to a recurrent neural network (RNN).
 In the case of GCN, the invariant space is a set of signals that correspond to the lowest frequency of graph spectra and that have “no information” other than connected components and node degrees for a node classification task whose goal is to predict the nodes’ properties in a graph.
 For example, there exists work that explores pre-training techniques for graphs to improve generalization Hu et al., (2019).
 As can be observed, the success rate drops more drastically whenever using gradients from a residual module instead of the skip connection.
 In particular, the proposed approach can be easily integrated into the text-only NMT model without annotating large-scale bilingual parallel corpora.
 For example, the cost and efforts of collecting numerous images of rare bird species can be prohibitively high.
 Rigidifying the network over time leads to a loss of learning capability for future tasks, which is known as ‘intransigence’ in the literature.
In this work, we provide an affirmative answer to the above question by proposing an algorithm to align the conditional distributions (on the target variable) of representations across different demographic subgroups.
 Class-based strategies (e.g, Hausman et al., (1976), Schwarz et al., (1978)) separate products into k classes, with each class assigned a dedicated area of storage.
 In fact, it is not difficult to see that there are many such classifiers that cannot be captured by AC-GNNs; one simple example is a classifier assigning true to every node if and only if the graph has an isolated node.
 We evaluate each network on two perceptual grouping “challenges” that are designed to be solved by either Gestalt or object-based visual routines.
Our contributions are the following:
 However, the space of possible unsupervised objectives is extremely large and the underlying modeling assumptions defined by each objective can only be reasoned about indirectly.
Due to the high likelihood that direct supervision will not scale to unboundedly complex tasks, many have worked on unsupervised exploration and skill acquisition methods such as intrinsic motivation.
 As shown in Figure 1, each architecture consists of a predefined skeleton with a stack of the searched cell.
 Our work presents two key contributions.
 Third, the latent model works even when the knowledge selection labels for previous dialogue are not available, which is common in practice.
 To not restrict the expressivity of this model, we propose to implicitly encode the task structure in a specialized AF, i.g,, in the optimization strategy.
 We do not see entanglement in classical bits, which are always independent – we can describe a byte by separately listing the state of each of the eight bits.
Sentiment Classification Consider an instance I highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone that a human inspects for a sentiment labeling task.
 We leverage these innovations to construct the directional message passing neural network (DimeNet).
On the other hand, compression based bound is another promising approach for tight generalization error evaluation which can avoid the exponential dependence on the depth.
 Due to the generalization gap demonstrated in the figure, A-SGD with a parameter server and large delays is not commonly used — despite it is relatively simple to implement and despite its vast potential to accelerate training.
 We emphasise its generality and increased expressive power in comparison to previous volume-preserving flows, such as NICE (Dinh et al., 2014).
 For example, the DFT has an efficient structured representation of size O(n log n), yet cannot be well-approximated by a low-rank transform of size n2.
 After being identified, re-training those EB tickets (using standard training) leads to comparable or even superior final accuracies, compared to either standard training, or re-training the “ground-truth” winning tickets drawn after full training as in (Frankle & Carbin, 2019).
 We show this by constructing a simple alternative: biasing solutions toward a non-zero norm still works and can even measurably improve performance for modern architectures.
 We then show how the skip-gram objective (§3.1; Mikolov et al., 2013), masked language modeling (§3.2; Devlin et al., 2018), and permutation language modeling (§3.3; Yang et al., 2019), fit in this framework.
 Unlike MPNNs, classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) avoid this problem by using aggregators (i.g,, convolutional filters) with a structural receiving filed defined on grids, i.g,, a Euclidean space, and are hence able to distinguish each input unit.
 Nevertheless, we develop techniques that still allow consistent estimation under general conditions, and provide effective estimates in practice.
Third, the training data are non-iid2, that is, a device’s local data cannot be regarded as samples drawn from the overall distribution.
 Each input dimension or each activation unit can be a potential branching option and neural networks of interest often have high dimensional inputs and thousands of hidden activation units.
 This leads us to a natural question: How do we leverage the low-rank structure in Q matrices to allow value-based techniques to achieve better performance on “low-rank” tasks?We propose a generic framework that allows for exploiting the low-rank structure in both classical planning and modern deep RL.
for satisfying a key motivating principle behind TRPO and PPO’s operations: trust region enforcement.
 This is especially useful when handling out-of-distribution task, which may need to ignore some of the meta-knowledge.
 Although DP-based algorithms have dominated RNA structure prediction, it is notable that they restrict the search space to nested structures, which excludes some valid yet biologically important RNA secondary structures that contain \\u2018pseudoknots\\u2019, i.g,, elements with at least two non-nested base-pairs (Fig 2 right).
• Attention on sequences of length L is O(L2) in both computational and memory complexity, so even for a single sequence of 64K tokens can exhaust accelerator memory.
 In such cases, scientists have a limited intuition about what useful features are and how to represent them.
To estimate the amount of information, we adapt the information bottleneck concept (Tishby et al., 2000; Alemi et al., 2017).
 Each deeper capsule of a particular type receives a set of predictions for its pose from a local pool of shallower capsules.
 Complete description of author contributions in Appendix ECNNs typically do not.
Readers may argue that learning a dense score for every interaction step is reminiscent of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Ng et al., 2000; Abbeel & Ng, 2004).
 Another set of approaches is based on variance reduction – for instance, compositional stochastic variance reduction gradient (Compositional-SVRG) (Lian et al., 2017) estimates the inner function G(x) and the gradient of function f(x) by using the variance reduction technique; however, the derived linear convergence rate is related to n.
 The work of Zhang et al., (2018) was mostly concerned about characterizing the complexity of a DNN and specifically counting the number of linear regions, into which the function represented by the DNN can divide the input space, by counting the number of vertices of some polytope representation.
 The EgoMap is complementary to the hidden state vector of the agent and is read with a combination of a global convolutional read operation and an attention model allowing the agent to query the presence of specific content.
 We decompose our attack mechanism into: (i.) manifold learning, (ii.) perturbation invariance, and (iii.) adversarial attack.
 For example, in Figure 3 in the supplementary material: 1) Out-of-distribution anomalies: An image may contain only background or an object which does not belong to any training class; 2) In-distribution anomalies: An image of class a may be annotated to class b or an image may contain more than one semantic object.
 Although it is most popular in computer vision, data augmentation has also proven effective in speech recognition (Jaitly & Hinton, 2013), music source separation (Uhlich et al., 2017) or text categorization (Lu et al., 2006).
 This and all steps below have constant complexity.
 For the nodes at the third layer, we reuse the projection results of the first layer, and do so for the four layer.
 GMLP can be seen as an architecture that learns expressive feature combinations and leverages them via group-wise operations.
 Indeed, as we show in our experiments, there are frequent cases where existing locally interpretable models even underperform commonly low-performing globally interpretable models.
How does one evaluate the value of a single datum? This is a crucial and challenging question.
 Moreover, we develop upon this and further propose our PST for more flexible style transfer, this could guide us to create domainindependent approaches.
In contrast, our human vision system can recognize the instance in space and predict the boundary given the visual cortex map, without any pre-defined shape template (Bear et al., 2007).
 Orthogonally, randomly wired networks (Xie et al., 2019) explored random topology as architecture by different generators, and obtained competitive performance.
 Such a minimax problem consists of two optimization problems, an inner maximization problem and an outer minimization problem: The inner problem targets on finding an optimal attack1Loss function `(θ; δ) is convex in primal variable θ and concave in dual variable δ.for a given data point (x, y) maximizing the loss, which essentially is the adversarial attack; The outer problem aims to find a θ so that the loss given by the inner problem is minimized.
 By nature, audio signals exhibit strong temporal coherence, e.g, one’s voice changes smoothly (See A→ B in inset).
 Motivated by this, we propose a Prototype-Assisted Adversarial Learning (PAAL) scheme which complements instance predictions with class prototypes to obtain more reliable conditional information for guiding the source-target feature representation alignment.
Another way is to learn an environment model to encourage the agent to explore the states, which are relatively unpredictable (Houthooft et al., 2016; Pathak et al., 2017; Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018).
 Regarding the fusion of the observed user behavior and the recommended items as inputs, the virtual user, which is the key of our model, imitates real-world scenarios and synthesizes user feedback.
 This has been implied in the work of Simon Du, et al., 12 for the special case of a 2-layer RELU-activated network.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new regularizer for noise-robust networks to circumvent the aforementioned setbacks of data augmentation.
Although verification methods prove to be effective in training robust networks (Wong & Kolter, 2018), they are computationally expensive, thus limiting their applicability to only small, at best medium, sized networks.
 They reported many ‘localist’ or ‘grandmother cell’ units that were 100% selective for specific letters or words, where all members of the selective category were more active than and disjoint from all non-members, as can be shown in jitterplots (Berkeley et al., 1995) (see fig.  1 for a unit selective to the letter ‘j’).
 To act as more bio-behavior, (Ponulak & Kasiński, 2010) introduced the remote supervised STDP-like rule to be capable of the learning of sequential output spike.
 Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, there are no proofs that ReLU networks trained with dynamic normalization on general data converge to a global minimum.
In Figure 1, we illustrate how nodes are embedded into low-dimensional vectors, where each node v has an optimal embeddings ov .
 We also propose FALCON-branch by fitting FALCON into the state-of-the-art convolution unit ShuffleUnitV2 which gives even higher accuracy.
 Two modified IWAE φ-gradients avoid this breakdown by removing high-variance ‘score-function’ terms:– IWAE-STL.
 To achieve dynamic pruning on different specific instances, all parameters of kernels are required to be stored (or even more parameters are introduced).
 We carefully design the auxiliary loss function such that it leads to a reliable confidence map, particularly, on the small objects.
 1.Convergence properties are sensitive to penalty parameters.
 Moreover, pix2pixHD are using instance maps as well as label maps to enable the generator to separate several objects of the same semantics.
The interactive rate refers to the the maximum temporal threshold of around 10msec (Wessel & Wright, 2002) over which humans would not be able to recognize the sound making event and the resultant sound as occuring at the same time.
 We design ProtoAttend to address this problem in an efficient way.
 The fusion of multiple images is key to exploiting cheap, high-revisit-frequency satellite imagery, but of low-resolution, moving away from the analysis of infrequent and expensive high-resolution images.
To generalize to arbitrary and held-out graphs, our policy is trained jointly over a set of dataflow graphs (instead of one at a time) and then fine-tuned on each graph individually.
 As we discover, indeed many of the data sets used in graph classification have isomorphic instances so much that in some of them the fraction of the unique non-repeating graphs is as low as 20% of the total size.
 The training is divided into several stages by the moments of decay.
In this work, we assume that the teacher network is overparameterized, which means that it can memorize all the labels via gradient descent training Du et al., (2018b;a); Oymak & Soltanolkotabi (2018); Allen-Zhu et al., (2018).
 Nguyen-Tuong et al., (2009); Park & Apley (2018) partition the input space into subregions, fit local models over subregions and then stitch local models into one.
 Instead of directly deriving formulae from the CKA (Eq. 1), we start with the logarithm of CKA (Eq. 2), and then find an informative lower bound (Eq.5).
 Thus incorporating such constraints is important in training a network to solve this task.
From another point of view, modifying skewness requires nonlinear operations.
 We tailor our methods to achieve state-of-the-art oracle complexities under the following two measurements: (i) the stochastic second-order oracle complexity is prioritized; (ii) the stochastic first- and second-order oracle complexities are treated equally.
 However, loss is not a direct measure of reliability, since a model trained with few instances may have a small loss, while the knowledge from the model could be highly biased and unreliable.
 Using a warm-up stage and training the model from small learning rates practically avoid this problem.
 Hence we utilize their similarity to interpret the effectiveness of the vanilla BatchNorm, along the line of lowering gradient Lipschitz constant and gradient variance, which is different from the view of the loss landscape (Santurkar et al., 2018).
 Note that, Xie et al., (2017) already demonstrated that the above procedure (alternatively optimizing attribute classifier and feature extractor) possesses an equilibrium where the encoder maximizes the true conditional entropy.
As a solution to the problem, we propose a new transfer RL approach named MULTI-source POLicy AggRegation (MULTIPOLAR).
 Hence, despite being based on known, continuous formulations, these systems can be seen as chaotic.
 In fig.  1 we show the effect of GWM on the performance of four types of GNNs with the same embedding dimension and the same number of layers on four molecular graph datasets.
 Specifically, the model of the decoding stage can be any state-of-the-art captioning model; in this work, we follow GVD (Zhou et al.,2019) to extend the widely used Up-Down model (Anderson et al., 2018).
We present Annealable Proximity Graph (APG), for simplifying proximity graphs.
 We consider a discrete filtering system as 1.
 The result demonstrated that the model had good performance on homologous test data.
Our key motivations are as follows.
 Moreover, previous works applied layer growth by once or a few times at pre-defined locations to grow a pre-defined number of layers; in contrast, ours automatically learns the number of new layers and growth locations without limiting growing times.
 Many acceleration methods (Baker et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018a; Bender et al., 2018; Pham et al., 2018) have been proposed to accelerate the search process, and more recent works (Liu et al., 2018b;Xie et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2018) remove the controller and instead optimize the architecture selection and parameters together with gradient-based optimization algorithms.
 Critically, our training strategy allows the network to incorporate both non-maximum suppression and top-K selection.
 The other is inspired by -zero concentrated differential privacy ( -zCDP) that uses the Maximal Relative Rényi (MR) divergence as the probability distance measurement and is called DMR robustness.
 In practice, we show that APGD obtains 17.48%, 35.21% and 9.39% improvement on average compared with PGD attack on CIFAR-10.
 Our formulation is general and closely related to several recently proposed lifelong learningalgorithms (Lopez-Paz et al., 2017; Chaudhry et al., 2018b; Riemer et al., 2018).
 The results show that A-GEM is surprisingly robust under traditional adversarial attacks.
 • Simple.
 However, using standard convolution filters suffers from the problem that some OD flows covered by a receptive field of regular CNNs are not spatially important.
 Our technical contributions can be summarized as follows:
 Then, we propose dependent beta-Bernoulli dropout, which is an input-dependent version of our variational dropout regularization.
 Further, we adopt the Block Maxima Method (BMM) (Gumbel, 2012) to choose the maximal distance for helping GEV fit the data.
 This is because the ODE solvers in CNF are sensitive to the complexity of themodel, and the number of function evaluations that the ODE solvers request in a single forward pass (NFEs) increases significantly as the complexity of the model increases, thereby slowing down the training.
Although quantizing neural network models has achieved impressive success on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Zhou et al., 2016; Rastegari et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016), there is still no successful attempt to quantize GAN models, especially in extreme low bits domain.
 Hence, we define the gap between the population and empirical distance as the generalization error.
 A review text reflects opinions about multiple topics a user cares about (Musat et al., 2013).
 Specifically, texts have the hierarchical structure which includes characters, words, phrase, sentences, and documents.
 It is also difficult to know whether the generated distribution is close to the true distribution, and this is often observed by human eyes.
To the best of our knowledge, existing literature talks little about modeling treatment effect on disease progression.
 As an application in generative modeling, we demonstrate that our method is able to produce authentic samples from a variational autoencoder while satisfying the imposed constraints.
 We then show that this approach can be successfully applied to deep networks for image classification tasks.
 Indeed, they fail to converge to the optimal rewards even with sufficient samples, which suggests that they suffer from the lack of expressivity.
 For example,BicycleGAN combines the objectives of both conditional Variational Auto-Encoders (cVAEs) (Sohn et al., (2015)) and a conditional version of Latent Regressor GANs (cLR-GANs) (Donahue et al., (2016); Dumoulin et al., (2016)) to train their network.
 With sparsemax, the attention weights obtained are sparse, leading to the selection (non-zero attention) of only a few relevant features.
 Han et al., (2018) developed a deep learning-based approach that can handle general high-dimensional parabolic PDEs.
 Moreover, we proportionally clip the perturbation that will be added to the input data.
 One can observe that the initial high learningrate results in training loss stagnating after a few epochs.
 It should be noted that the neighbor sampling was introduced as a heuristic method originally, and they did not provide any theoretical guarantees.
 However, updating derived posterior sampling algorithm in TS-GLM demands imputing the multivariate coefficients and creates computation burden at each iteration Scott (2010)Scott (2015)Hill et al., (2017).
 When domain shifts happen in space, we rigorously prove that such layer-wise “correction” by the same spatial transform applied to bases suffices to align the learned features.
 Our contributions in this paper can be summarized as follows:
 For instance, while a coarse manual transcription of a minute of complex piano music might be achieved within a moderate time frame, a millisecond precision requirement \\u2014 a common assumption for deep learning models \\u2014 significantly increases the annotation burden.
 The recently proposed neural ordinarydifferential equation (NODE) (Chen et al., 2018) views a neural network as an ordinary differential equation (ODE), whose derivative is parameterized by the network, and the output is the solution to this ODE.
This paper makes the following contributions:
Other recent applications include generating model-agnostic contrastive explanations (Dhurandhar et al., 2019) and escaping saddle points (Flokas et al., 2019).
 More concretely, we applied TT–embedding to the click through rate (CTR) prediction problem, a crucial task in the field of digital advertising.
 Can the attention layer learn arbitrary contextual representations? What is the role of the feed forward layer in the Transformer block? Do we need such a large embedding size to capture the context of all the tokens? Answering these questions requires an understanding of the representation power of the units in the Transformer.
This work extends the above approaches by providing the following contributions:
 In this work, we describe a simple technique to parallelize Scheduled Sampling.
 We apply this reflection mapping to the problem of word attribute transfer by estimating an appropriate mirror that maps word pairs with a binary targetattribute (e.g, male and female) and keeps the other words without that attribute using training data.
 We prove that indeed this is sufficient to ensure convergence even under heavy-tailed noise.
 Using a graph representation and reinforcement learning, You et al propose a novel method for molecule generation with specific properties You et al., (2018).
fective KD strategy for both stages.
 That is, in every iteration of Bayesian optimization, we train a meta neural network to predict the accuracy of unseen neural architectures in the search space.
 In their original versions, both GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2014) were trained in an unsupervised manner and1CZ-GEM: CZ-Generative Modelgave rise to entangled representations.
 VAEs use the encoder to produce approximations to the posterior distribution of the latent variable given the data, and the training objective is to maximize a variational lower bound of the data log likelihood.
In this work, we propose COmposable Semi-parametric MOdelling (COSMO), which is a method that can leverage the large spectrum of motion skills from unlabeled data in a semi-parametric manner.
 At present, many excellent stereo matching algorithms based on deep learning, such as the GC-Net (Kendall et al., 2017), PSMNet (Chang & Chen, 2018) and GwcNet (Guo et al., 2019), generally adopt similar processes, including feature extraction, matching cost volume construction, 3D convolution and disparity regression.
 Besides,both models have weak compatibility with parallel training, which is key to efficient training on a large dataset.
 In this article, we only require the black-box model to produce as output a distribution over the classes, a soft requirement as any model with a soft-max layer satisfies it.
 In fact, the instability 1 commonly exists not only in different runs,1In this paper, we use instability and variance interchangeably.
 Moreover, it is generic, and so can be applied to nearly all GAN variants.
To simplify the complicated “encoder-decoder” structure of ConvNet used in DIP, we consider the following network structure: Embedding H (linear), encoding φr (non-linear), decoding ψr (non-linear), and backward embedding H† (linear) (see fig. 1).
 We finally take the sum of all learned node embeddings to obtain the embedding of the whole graph.
 We are able to establish a family of neural networks, from simple to complex, by following regularization paths as solutions of differential inclusions of inverse scale spaces.
The first two criteria express the essence of boosting network; the third criterion identifies the key difference from NAS and other trivial or brute-force solutions, such as randomly searching.
The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
 Gasser used Extensible dependency grammar (XDG) to accomplish the work.
 Similarly to Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Ng & Russell, 2000, IRL), we focus on trying to infer the mapping from contexts to rewards by observing experts.
 Although the former one has received the most attention from researchers, the last one fits better to the desiderata of a Continual Learning system as expressed in Farquhar & Gal (2018) and (van de Ven & Tolias, 2019).
 The advantages are quite obvious, the imaging quality is higher, and it shows great advantages in medical research.
g Kipf & Welling (2017); Schlichtkrull et al., (2017)).
 For example, if the hardware cannot handle extremely low bit-widths (1 or 2 bits), instead treating them as 8-bit integers with upper bits filled with zeros, we cannot exploit the reduction of bit width to improve inference speed.
Our analysis makes use of a duality theorem, which captures an intuitive concept.
 Pruning: Optimizing for high per-activation variability/uncertainty and predictive accuracy simultaneously lead to the network packing more entropy into the least significant neurons – so that the most crucial neurons are free to operate unperturbed.
 Our ablation study reveals the importance of using AST paths forboth reading and generating code.
com/english/semantic_textual_similarity.
 As is reported in Ganin et al., (2016), such methods fail to generalize in certain closely related source/target pairs, e.g, digit classification adaptation from MNIST to SVHN.
As ż(t) is a time-derivative, its precision is highly dependent on noise on z(t).
 We focus on the match prediction problem where one wishes to estimate the likelihood of a group of M items preferred over another, based on partially observed group comparison data among a collection of n items.
 These algorithms include standard Basis Pursuit (BP), (k, t)-sparse Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) and Dantzig Selector (DS) with an additional constraint.
 The experts reconstruct the original input data and can be used for data generation when sampling from the variational distribution (E).
 It trains with the conventional cross-entropy loss from the ground truth label along with the mimicry loss to learn from its peers.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
These models are limited when applied to the GDA task as they only align the feature distribution, ignoring the real issue of SLD which exists in many real-world applications.
 In analogy to strictly proper scoring rules1, we aim to design a score function S s.t. Ex∼PS(xp, x′) > Ex∼PS(xq, x′) for any q ̸= p, where x′ is a reference answer that can be defined using elicited reports.
 If eachupdate is differentially private, the composition theorem of differential privacy ensures the whole learning procedure is differentially private.
Adjusting the output distributions to match the observed empirical ones via a post process is called uncertainty calibration.
 We suggest benchmarking on the world records human baseline and show that RL algorithms are in fact far from solving most of the Atari games.
In this paper we address the problem of dose-response estimation from observational data by building on the framework introduced in GANITE (Yoon et al., 2018).
 The proposed specification is a text-based and encapsulates the model evaluation by defining its pre-processing, inference, post-processing pipeline steps and required SW stack.
 As shown in Figure 1, we clean this data using a graph convolutional network (GCN) (Kipf & Welling, 2017), which learns to predict a class relevance score per image based on the source (clean vs.
 Hence, we propose the MPO algorithm with a provable convergence guarantee.
We show theoretically and empirically that splitting model parameters as in FURL affects neither model performance nor the inherent structure in learned user embeddings.
 Recently, to accelerate adversarial training, a few methods have been proposed.
 The distortion mismatch also exists.
 Zhang et al., (2018) propose a defense to this effect: they determine whether an input is adversarial, given the Jacobian-based1i.g, the forward derivative of the classifier with respect to the input imagesaliency map concatenated with the image.
 Meanwhile, the wheel area also provides abundant pixel information for keypoint detection, including visual identifiable geometric and location information.
 But how do we select β? The most prominent choice among practitioners is β = 0.9.
 These non-parametric and low computational properties construct extremely efficient neural network from the perspective of parameter and computation as well as enjoying accuracy gain.
 In this study, we propose the use of implicit ensembles with hundreds of training checkpoints from different experimental runs, and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
 More importantly, the gradient domain corruption can be naturallyextended to span multiple scales with a Laplacian pyramid representation of the data (Burt & Adelson, 1983).
 Integrating F (·) and G(·) in a bidirectional way will allow the model concentrate the instances with identical label and will enable it to get the metric representation of testing data without labels.
 As a practical advantage, RPGANs can be efficiently updated to new data via the simple addition of new instances to the bucket, avoiding re-training the full model from scratch.
 In the original paper, this was enforced by clipping the weights of the discriminator to lie inside some small box, which, however, proved to be inefficient.
 In particular, we propose a novel Cross-Dimensional Self-Attention (CDSA) mechanism to capture the attention crossing all dimension jointly yet in a decomposed manner.
 Furthermore, to cope with the problem of missing explicit expression of πE(a|s) in reality, we develop a new practical algorithm, called Demonstration Actor Critic (DAC), by making several approximations that can be implemented using deep neural networks.
 However, the bounding box is easy to obtain than the masking label.
 Note that the number of quantization bits can be different for each layer (e.g, Wang et al., (2019)) to allow fractional quantization bits on average.
To enable the possibility of large-scale joint optimisation of deep architectures we contribute MANAS, the first multi-agent learning algorithm for neural architecture search.
 Our work is aligned with theirs and extends their findings, as we show that logits can be used not only to detect over-optimized adversarial examples, but also ”regular” adversarial examples and OOD data.
 However, none of these work provides a theoretical guarantee on the regret of the algorithms.
 Otherwise, the developers can seek alternative designs of the model (e.g, adjust DNN structures or learning algorithms), or further tune the hyper-parameters (such as the learning rate).
Unconditional INN training is related to that of VAEs, but it compensates for some key disadvantages: Firstly, since reconstructions are perfect by design, no reconstruction loss is needed, and generated images do not become blurry.
The last observation suggests that networks designed for transfer learning tasks may benefit from increasing the width, even though this change may have little effect on performance on the original task.
 Besides these, graph methods Henaff et al., (2015); Defferrard et al., (2016); Yi et al., (2017); Bruna et al., (2013) are also considered for processing algorithms for 3D data.
 The centrality of a node (sentence) is computed by PageRank (Brin & Page, 1998) to decide whether a sentence should be included in the final summary.
 Similar to regularization of a classifier, a generative model can suffer from the learned approximate posterior distribution deviating further from the true posterior with each further task increment.
 Particularly, a mean representation with arbitrarily large total correlation can have a corresponding sample distribution with low total correlation.
 In practice, disagreement-based meth-ods (Xie et al., 2019; Berthelot et al., 2019) have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art results on several standard datasets, surpassing generative approaches by a large margin.
We advocate evaluating model uncertainty via expected Bayes factors (Kass & Raftery, 1995), which provide a rigorous probabilistic approach to evaluating uncertainty, and are widely used for hypothesis testing in other scientific fields, see for example (Good, 1979) and (Jeffreys, 2003).
 Third, memory-based methods (Lopez-Paz & Ranzato, 2017; Hayes et al., 2018; Isele & Cosgun, 2018; Riemer et al., 2019; Chaudhry et al., 2019a), store a few examples from past tasks in a so-called episodic memory, to be revisited when training for a new task.
 We believe the trade-off between disentanglement and reconstruction in VAE-based approaches can be addressed by a different training approach.
 Both actors utilise an attention mechanism to filter input data and by having access to the simulation rendering system, we can optimise image and state based attention masks to align.
 First, computing the gradient becomes an intractable problem for methods that maintain the KKT condition by using Newton’s method.
 Inparticular, we show that a network with a small dropout regularizer enjoys a small generalization gap.
 We propose to use the gradient alignment between the training examples and the dev set as a reward signal for a parametric scorer network, as illustrated in Figure 1.
 We sometimes refer to this discriminative attraction to class prototypes as prototypical magnetization.
 In contrast, methods that integrate contextual word representations support both types of generalization.
 Instead, TriMap incorporates a higher order of structure to construct the embedding by means of triplets:(i, j, k) , point i is closer to point j than point k.
This brings three seemingly related properties into our focus: flatness, robustness, and generalization.
In summary, our contributions are:
 For example, agents may treat repeated observations of a neighbor’s guess as conveying additional information, even when this is not the case (this occurs for example when this neighbor’s only information is his private signal).
To enable scalable data collection, this assumption must be relaxed: the existing data should come from a family of related MDPs.
Our contributions are listed as follows.
Hence, there naturally exists another type of out-of-distribution input, the inputs that belong to the same dataset but come from classes not represented by the support.
One approach that has shown great promise for biological classification tasks is deep learning.
 We aim to directly learn a classification model using labeled data which is capable of generalizing well under input distribution shift (not constrained to being locally) without making any changes to the model during test time.
 (4) Existing studies use the same error estimate for both Topk and Randk in distributed SGD by exploiting the properties of (4), which cannot differentiate the convergence behavior of two operators.
 However, in POUM, the objective function, a utility function, is formulated around the uncertainty-aware dynamics model.
 The second part is a NeuralGuided Monte Carlo Tree Search (NG-MCTS) that uses this NN to probabilistically guide the search at every step to find expressions that fit a set of data points.
Inspired by the observation that the intrinsic dimension of image data is actually much smaller than its pixel space dimension (Levina & Bickel, 2005) and the vulnerability of a model grows with its input dimension (Simon-Gabriel et al., 2018), we propose a defense framework that embeds input images into a low-dimensional space using a deep encoder and performs classification based on the latent embedding with a classifier network.
 Our meta-VI learns an inference algorithm that is tailored to the problem of interest.
 This has led to several innovations over the years to get deeper networks to train more easily, such as careful initialization strategies (Glorot & Bengio, 2010; He et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019), residual connections (He et al.,2016), and various normalization schemes like batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) and weight normalization (Salimans & Kingma, 2016).
 Notably, on IMDb, UDA with 20 labeled examples outperforms the state-of-the-art model trained on 1250x more labeled data.
 Since ALI-G is easy to implement in any deep learning framework, we believe that it can prove to be a practical and reliable optimization tool for deep learning.
By providing these standardized datasets, common problem definition and baselines, we hope this work will simplify and enable faster iteration of research on remote sensing and inspire general representation learning experts to test their newest methods in this critical domain.
 The deviation of the classifier from the linear model makes the robustness certification problem to be a non-convex optimization which is often difficult to solve exactly.
 During inference, unused parts of the network can be ignored by either pruning out nodes or zeroing out their activations (Figure 1).
The theory behind such adaptation in reference tracking control problems has been typically restricted to deterministic dynamical systems with well-defined reference trajectories (Åström & Wittenmark, 2013; Chowdhary et al., 2013).
 In addition, introduction of a high-performance deep neural network architecture unlocks the benefits of gradient descent-based end-to-end deep learning for tabular data.
 This block, formulated in a residual learning spirit (He et al., 2016), is designed specially for fusing all the different types of tensors and operations synergistically.
 The contributions of this paper are as follows:
 Several new experiments are presented to demonstrate the shortcoming of the GNNs and they show that providing the geometrical representation of the graph to the neural network substantially improves the capability of the GNN in inferring the structure of the graph.
To summarize, our main contributions are as follows:
 We develop a novel deep learning model, Turbulent-Flow Net (TF-Net), that en-hances the capability of predicting complex turbulent flows with deep neural networks.
 We provide sample and computational complexity bounds and showcase the algorithm in Lifelong RL experiments (Section 5).
To study real-world noise in a controlled setting, we establish a benchmark of controlled real-world noisy labels, building on two existing datasets for coarse and fine-grained image classification: MiniImageNet (Vinyals et al., 2016) and Stanford Cars (Krause et al., 2013).
 While successful, such embedding-based methods make the strong assumption that all relations are binary.
 Our approach relies on minimizing a loss regularized against large input gradientsE (x,y)∼P L(f(x;w), y) + λ2 ‖∇x L(f(x;w), y)‖2∗where ‖ · ‖∗ is dual to the one measuring adversarial attacks (for example the `1 norm for attacks measured in the `∞ norm).
 During testing, the digit ‘6’ is given to the network.
 Surprisingly, almost all of the existing work in the area (31; 35) has ignored this important realization.
 Compared to natural language, programs are precise in their semantics, have clearer internal structure, and require a much smaller vocabulary, making them an attractive representation for question answering systems as well (Johnson et al., 2017; Yi et al., 2018; Mao et al., 2019).
 To overcome the data sparsity issue, we further leverage non-parallel data by using a hybrid approach.
 In contrast, standard adversarial training forces the network to classify adversarial examples correctly with maximal confidence but provides no guidance how to extrapolate beyond adversarial examples seen during training.
 Embeddings learned using Skip-gram are known to factorize a matrix of pointwise mutual information (PMI) of co-occurrences between each word and local context words (Levy & Goldberg, 2014).
 Therefore, they are able to offer more useful advice than matching n-grams with a finite number of human references.
Strengths.
 To jointly embedthe local and global information, we present a novel graph encoder including both the edge and the node convolution layers.
 Later, we employ the updated policy to re-populate the tree search.
 In Bekoulis et al., (2018b), they augment this model with adversarial training.
 Our experiments on designing recurrent neural networks for language modeling are somewhat short of the state-of-the-art (Zilly et al., 2017), but we find that CoNAS still finds competitive results with less search time than previous NAS approaches.
 By contrast, localization approaches like class activation map (CAM) (Zhou et al., 2016), GradCAM (Selvaraju et al., 2017), GradCAM++ (Chattopadhay et al., 2018) and RISE (Petsiuk et al., 2018) are highly class-discriminative, namely, localizing image sub-regions reasonedfor a prediction class.
 To foster large-scale learning, we devise the active set algorithm that only needs an active data subset of small fixed size for training.
 In the following section, we use empirical results to demonstrate this mixture effect.
The interpretability of the network resulting from pruning can be seen as a filter-wise and signalwise network dissection: The removal of filters in a controlled manner allows us to determine how different classified objects affects other classes, how the density of the classes in the learned feature space affects the accuracy of a classification and how the structure of the learned multi-class feature space allows to improve the accuracy of a single-class classification.
 However, a practical attack method should require as little as possible knowledge of attacked models, which include training data and procedure, models weights and architectures, output probabilities and hard labels (Athalye et al., 2018).
 Cutting this edge will result in the optimal value for the normalized cuts objective.
 For example, the XLNet-Large (Yang et al., 2019) costs 2.
 Taking C-JPG images as a example, the image compression operation is related to decreasing information from original image instead of adding specific noises.
 In summary, our contributions are as follows:
 This is because the training data only provides a single reactant set for each input target, even if this is not the only valid reaction to synthesize the target.
 This provides a starting point for gradually reducing the amount of required supervision and increasing the sizes of the learned subroutines in order to work towards end-to-end learning of complex algorithms with neural networks.
 Hence, the overall challenge boils down to solving two (perhaps) simpler sub-challenges: solving the latent MDPs and combining these solutions to solve the belief MDP.
Moreover, there are serious concerns about the implications this has for proofs of GAN convergence (Mescheder et al., 2018).
 Starting from an initial state, a basic 2-opt based local search is firstly used to search within a small neighborhood.
 This technique ensures that the RL model learns a policy that stays close the state-action distribution of the batch, combatingextrapolation error.
 We also demonstrate that embedding distributions are related to label uncertainty and input ambiguity.
 This kind of hierarchical policy is biologically plausible and intuitive.
 A first intuition may be to take a pretrained LM, separate the text into segments, place a Recursive Neural Network (RNN) after the embedding, and simply pass in the segments sequentially.
To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply Neural ODEs to real world problems.
 In this work, we derive contextual embedding of source code by training a BERT model on source code.
The paper makes the following contributions:
 Complexity-wise, QBF problems are PSPACE-complete (Kleine Büning & Bubeck, 2009), which lies in-between the NP-completeness of SAT problems and the semi-decidability of predicate logic problems.
A complementary approach to obtaining generalizable solutions is to avoid over-fitting or getting stuck in local minima.
 This not only makes the model computational and memory efficient but also aids in distributing the loss function throughout the network for better training.
 Since the attained trajectories are sampled according to a certain policy, directly employing supervised learning may not necessarily lead to the mentioned result especially when the policy is stochastic.
 Second, while multi-head attention mechanism is able to learn the global dependencies, we argue that it ignores the local structures that are inherently important in sequences such as natural languages.
 Role-based alignment allows us to take unstructured multi-agent data, and reformat it into a consistent vector format that enables subsequent machine learning (fig. 1).
 The learned abstract representations of action sequences (we called options) allow us to do RL at a higher level, and easily transfer the knowledge between different tasks.
 They introduced a method to learn a transition model that is applied to all the slots of their latent scene representation.
 Disentangled variables are generally considered to contain interpretable information and reflect separate factors of variation in the data for e.g, lighting conditions, style, colors, etc.
 Cai et al., (2019) simply use reinforcement learning to get some packing results, which serve as the initialization to accelerate the original heuristic algorithms.
 As shown in fig.
 For examining the interpretability of attention weights, we perform manual evaluation.
For a large , the optimization problem of (1) itself may pose the trade-off.
 In this situation, applying majority voting leads to wrong answers.
 2: Init: w0 ∈ Rd.
In this paper, we propose an activation decomposition framework for visual explanation of deep metric learning and explore the relationship between each activated region by point-topoint activation response between two images.
 How to effectively make use of this natural graphical information of the molecular structure, therefore, becomes a vital problem.
 The censoring time gives a lower bound on the survival time for the i-th subject.
 Our proposed method aims to reduce the likeli-hood of landmarks being allocated to the background, thereby improving overall landmark quality and reducing the number of landmarks required to achieve state-of-the-art performance.
 There are a variety of function types developed such as graph convolution operations (Kipf & Welling (2016)), attention-based functions (Veličković et al., (2017)), gated functions (Li et al., (2015); Deng et al., (2016)).
To tackle this issue, we propose using the idea of distant supervision (e.g, Mintz et al., (2009); Riedel et al., (2010)) to regularize training.
 s(x) is usually positively associated with the odds that x ∈ S.
 But, directly using the lottery ticket hypothesis with differential privacy is non-trivial as we need to ensure the complete process (from ticket selection to training the winning ticket) is end-to-end differentially private.
 LaPool performs a dynamic and hierarchical segmentation of graphs by selecting a set of centroid nodes as cluster representatives (centroids) using the graph Laplacian, then learns a sparse assignment of the remaining nodes (followers) into these clusters using an attention mechanism.
 For instance, an error canvas circling each incorrect region.
 Our goal is to flexibly support a1τ is defined in § 3.2.richer set of transformations implemented in a state of the art renderer (e.g, changing the background of the image, weather conditions, or the time of day), as we specify in detail in § 2.
 Figure 1b shows the importance of such good initialization; surface gradients can be followed, which greatly facilitates learning.
Armed with recent theories on the homogeneity between class centroids and projection weights of classifiers (Wang et al., 2017a; Liu et al., 2017b; 2018; Deng et al., 2019a), the entire distancemeasuring procedure can be easily accomplished by simply encoding all elements in one group.
 GLAS uses a simple grid search; once completed over the entire image, the response maps are fused to construct the final heat map.
 For those states with a large dependency factor, the importance sampling estimator will potentially increase variance.
 This phenomenon has motivated many investigations to directly remove these inhibited channels, such as network slimming (Liu et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2018) and channel pruning (He et al., 2017b).
 This problem is very challenging, because the model contains both discrete and continuous latent variables (a so-called “hybrid system”), and has nonlinear transition and observation models.
 The peer loss takes a form of evaluating classifiers’ prediction using noisy labels on both the targeted samples and a particular form of constructed “peer” samples.
 To mitigate the computational burden of computing WDs, we rely on their entropy-regularized formulations.
 More specifically, the encoder maps an input time-series into a latent encoding; the selector utilizes the encoding and assigns a cluster to which the time-series belongs to via a sampling process; and the predictor estimates the future outcome distribution conditioned on either the encoding or the centroid of the selected cluster.
 Since, these components depend upon a large vocabulary-size, they require large number of parameters which results in higher latency and larger memory requirements.
 However, before custom architectures or low-level kernels can be built, a general theory of why certain topologies perform – or underperform – is needed.
 For example, Figure 1 shows the sparsity pattern of three citation networks.
 Different from SGD, which adopts a universal learning rate for all coordinates, the effective learning rate of adaptive gradient methods, i.g,, the universal base learning rate divided by the second order moment term, is different for different coordinates.
 We show that the over-parameterization requirement of ResNet only weakly depends on the depth, which justifies the advantage of ResNet over feedforward network.
The latter constraint often results in center-cropped images of the target input to the “search” branch of the Siamese network.
 First, the weights in the supernet are deeply coupled.
1In this paper, relevance scores indicate the contributions of features to a specific decision.
 Distributing storage over a multigrid hierarchy allows us to instantiate large amounts while remaining parameter-efficient.
 Thus the consistency of pixels in overlappedpatches has been ignored (Gu et al., 2015; Papyan et al., 2017b).
 In contrast, non-robust features are much easier to construct, using the standard adversarial example generation procedure (Szegedy et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015; Madry et al., 2018).
 In real applications, hyper-parameter is commonly tuned by hand.
 JAX MD is end-to-end differentiable, written in pure python, and is fast since simulations are just-in-time compiled to CPU, GPU, or TPU using XLA.
We summarize our main contributions as follows:
 In the searching process of the cursors, a quantization process is applied to compress the model size at the same time.
 The generative cleaning network and detector network are jointly trained using adversarial learning so that the detector network cannot detect the existence of attack noise pattern in the images recovered by the generative cleaning network.

Consistency metrics often use some form of concept detector to ensure that the requested conditioning appears in the generated image as expected.
Reducing network input dimension (e.g, lowering image resolution) is a straightforward way to reduce computational cost.
 To incorporate physical models into NAS, we find that three modifications must be made to the existing NAS framework: (1) the inclusion of physical inputs; (2) the inclusion of physical operation sets; and (3) edge weights to normalize variations in the degrees of freedom introduced by the inclusion of physical operators.
Combining these representational and modelling techniques yields a highly expressive and broadly applicable generative model of audio.
 This, combined with the noisy EEG signals and stochasticity in inferring error-potentials, raises significant challenges in terms of the practicality of the solution.
Making it less sensitive to inaccuracies of representation learnt by under-trained models.
Why should synthetic data improve TSC? Note that there is an important distinction between training a student to mimic a teacher with synthetic data and training a student to solve the original supervised learning problem with synthetic data.
 In the SDGM, a GMM-based discriminative model is trained by sparse Bayesian learning.
 The temporal patterns of the unsmooth region differ more significantly from those in all his closest neighbors.
 Our approach builds on the idea of quantifying the contributions of each variable series into the prediction of target variable via a novel designed prototypical Granger causal attention mechanism.
 Empirically, the stochastic reconstructions produced by the decoder retain semantic features of the respective input examples as verified by distance in Inception feature space, while unconditionally generated samples are diverse and cover the data manifold, as verified with FID scores (Heusel et al., 2017).
 Each factor is represented by an individual scalar energy function that takes as input an image and outputs a low energy value if the factor is exhibited in the image.
 However, it has been shown that the usage of the mere reconstruction error can be a suboptimal choice for an outlier score because outliers tend to convergeto an average reconstruction error that is indistinguishable from that of inliers as the network converges (19).
In this paper, we propose a novel method that generates explanations for a VQA model’s answer.
 Therefore it is hard to reach high robustness for standard training methods.
 To summarize, our contributions are:
In parallel with the loss function, how to select informative pairs to construct the loss function has also received great attention.
 In practice, one or more of the modalities maybe be missing, leading to a challenging multimodal data imputation task.
 Tensor representations are powerful since they retain rich expressivity even with a small number of parameters.
To achieve speedups and a desired final degree of sparsity, we aim to apply the techniques in Han et al., (2015b) and Mao et al., (2017) at earlier stages in training at higher frequency within a period which we call the pruning era, usually a period of 20-30 epochs.
 Such convolution-pooling layer stacks have serious drawbacks in constructing very deep networks, and eventually gave way to modern lattice CNN architectures such as ResNets (He et al., 2016), which use skip connections to enable much deeper architectures without accuracy loss.
 The network is then used to assign pseudo labels to the unlabeled target data.
 Therefore, in this work we propose to develop a technique for more robust model interpolation / optimal connection finding by investigating the effect of weight symmetry in the loss landscape.
 Then, we show that following:Theorem 1 (Informal version of Theorem 2).
 The algorithm trains a RAE by iteratively eliminating features that are not important for performing accurate reconstruction.
 We thus raise and answer a question: with the help of learned priors, can shallow VAEs achieve performance comparable or better than deep hierarchical VAEs? This question is important because a shallow1The term “hierarchical latent variables” refers to multiple layers of latent variables, formulated as p(x) = Ep(z1)Ep(z2|z1) .Ep(zK |zK−1,...,z1) p(x|z1, . , zK); while “one latent variable” refers to just one z in standard VAEs.
 Our contributions are:
 Here we show that the k-NN based method is robust and does not require such a clean set of samples.
 The regions of the local refinements are determined by sampling the values of additive auxiliary variables.
 Hence, our method can be effective, particularly for nodes in the periphery or a sparsely labeled dataset.
 In fact, according to the recent research by Adebayo et al., (2018b), most methods with great visual inspection lack sensitivity to the model and the data generating process.
 It is thus an interesting topic to disentangle robust and non-robust features with certain kinds of human priors in the network designing or training process.
 With suitable search heuristics, our framework provides a computationally effective means for minimizing the effects of delusional bias in Q-learning, while admitting scaling to practical problems.
 Since distances are concentrated and become meaningless in high dimensional spaces (Beyer et al., 1999), we seek to obtain distances preserved in a projected space to be the supervisory signal.
To overcome these difficulties and make decision-based attacks better reflect the robustness of models, we propose a meta algorithm called BOSH-attack that consistently boosts the solution quality of existing iterative local update based attacks.
 Specifically, it means that deep networks tend to learn easy and correct patterns first and then over-fit on(possibly noisy) training data set (see fig. 1(a)-(b)).
 In other words, you need a minimum of two NN to perform the same classification task.
 Therefore, an intelligent attacker should prefer attacking key steps over non-key steps.
 These decision states are a function of the environment as well as the states an agent can reliably reach.
 This training is expected to result in “bounded/closed” regions in input space with lower entropy over the in-distribution, and the rest of the region (corresponding to OOD), with higher entropy.
 We propose two embeddingapproaches on which the policy is conditioned, namely, a direct supervised learning approach and a variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2013) based unsupervised approach.
 In addition, we introduce Shifted Q-functions which represent the farsighted return after this truncated rollout.
networks can represent a rich distribution of networks that perform approximately equally well on the classification task.
 The ubiquity of reported robustness/accuracy trade-offs in the literature have even led to the hypothesis that these trade-offs may be inevitable (Tsipras et al., 2018).
 SOP employs a simple normalization scheme to address the bounded nature of the action spaces, allowing satisfactory exploration throughout training.
Overall, our experiments show that winning tickets are surprisingly robust to many of these data/label distribution changes.
 VAE is capable of carrying out inference and generation in one framework by two collaborative functional modules.
 By modifying the loss function with a novel combination of the pre-trained discriminator and the original and compressed generators, we can overcome this behavioral degradation and achieve compelling compression rates with little change in the quality of the compressed generator’s ouput.
 Our UNITER model is trained on a large-scale V+L dataset composed of four subsets: (i) COCO (Lin et al., 2014); (ii) Visual Genome (VG) (Krishna et al., 2017); (iii) Conceptual Captions (CC) (Sharma et al., 2018); and (iv) SBU Captions (Ordonez et al., 2011).
 However, due to the stochastic sampling, SG-HT can only attain a sub-optimal estimation bound, as shown in Table 1, which is inferior to those of deterministic gradient methods such as FG-HT.
 Under this objective, a policy must learn good visual representations, so that it is able to find visually surprising inputs for the vision model.
 However, in this approach, the training and personalization procedures are completely disconnected, which results in potentially suboptimal personalized models.
 Thus, a significantly better convergence and generalization analyses with respect to network width can be obtained because the positivity of the neural tangent kernel is not required.
 Again, the difficulty here is that the practical GAN formulation is not convex-concave, even for simple discriminators/generators.
 However, in mechanism design settings we engineer the game in order to achieve certain desired agent behaviors, and can thus construct games that are dominance solvable.
 Learning stops when the model converges.
 However, it is difficult to define the attributes of predicates.
Because of its symmetry, this is equivalent to the number of bits we can reconstruct of the past given observations of the future.
While a symmetric and non-negative matrix with a zero diagonal can easily be parameterized by, e.g, a neural network, it is not immediately clear that this matrix indeed belongs to a set of n points in Euclidean space and even then, that this space has the right dimension.
 Some of these models are not targeting a distribution over conformations but the most stable folded configuration (Evans et al., 2018; Ingraham et al., 2019), while others are not transferable between different molecules (Lemke & Peter, 2019; Noé et al., 2019).
 This key property allows us to handle non-stochastic missing data, while satisfying the constraints related to adaptation and to the classification objective.
 Our key insight is that, to facilitate data hallucination to improve the performance of new classification tasks, two important requirements should be satisfied: (i) precision: the generatedexamples should lead to good classifier performance, and (ii) collaboration: all the components including the hallucinator and the learner need to be trained jointly.
 The supervised statistical constraints can be interpreted as a generativeclassifier on high-level data representations giving up the full generative process.
Our motivation stems from the observation that existing DRL-based solvers lack efficient policies for generating solutions to combinatorial problems.
 Our method focuses on the differences by removing components in each class representative that are shared with closely related classes.
 This allows revising the spatiotemporal correlations and the configuration of the data points over time, and guarantees the location-invariant property is met at different steps.
 However, we can sidestep this issue by noting that the objective is the mutual information between the state and the goal, I(S;G), which can be written as:H(S)\\u2212H(S|G) = I(S;G) = H(G)\\u2212H(G|S).
 We show that in linear regression, this is also exactly the regime where augmentation can be most harmful.
In Section 3, we give a brief description of state-of-the-art Neural and Evolutionary agents, and introduce the Evo-NAS agent in Section 4.
 Moreover, Yu & Huang (2019) proposed universally slimmable networks (US-Nets) that extend slimmable networks to arbitrary widths.
 How would you group the characters below?This task is not particularly hard, even if the reader was never shown labeled examples prior to the task, simply because the reader was already familiar with the class semantics of interest (characters), and can generalize them to new classes.
In this work,
 We establish that such models, which use filters with bounded eigenvaluesindependent of graph size, can satisfy the strong notion of uniform stability and thus is generalisable.
In sum, the main contributions of this paper are the following:
 (ii) When the task distribution is much wider (riding bicycle as meta-train task and riding motorcycle as meta-test task), these methods can hardly be effective since primitive action execution mechanism is entirely different although they may sharea similar high-level strategy.
 Using such a model to reason may lead to the wrong conclusions about the optimal course of action as we demonstrate in this paper.
 In this case, GEM is greedy in minimizing the loss of the current task, overlooking the need of backward transfer to previous tasks.
 In this viewpoint, it can be shown that prediction using CNTK/CNN-GP with GAP is equivalent to prediction using CNTK/CNN-GP without GAP but with full translation data augmentation with wraparound at the boundary.
 The phenomenon is called myopic policy (Bertsekas & Tsitsiklis, 1996), where a too low discount leads to highly sub-optimal policies.
 Conversely, we concretely demonstrate how the architecture, initialization,and optimization strategy that gives the best accuracy for non-private learning can be a poor fit for learning with privacy.
In this work, we propose an alternative technique, Sparse Weight Activation Training (SWAT), that can train deep CNNs on complex data sets like ImageNet.
 Our paper makes several contributions.
 So we wonder can we improve the model compatibility if we consider information from the models trained on the original data? For example, Wasserstein GAN (WGAN, Arjovsky et al., 2017) performs a meanmatching between the distribution of real data and generated data.
 This approach stands in contrast to other works in interactive imitation learning that correct distribution mismatch by using one-step feedback.
 To train narrower distributions for the efficiency of HWR, we also introduce a centralized quantization (CQ) process and a weighted ridge (WR) regularizer.
 Causal learning has been extensively used to guarantee fairness andexplainability properties of the predicted output (Kusner et al., 2017; Nabi & Shpitser, 2018; Datta et al., 2016).
 Given a query, we then apply attention on the union of the real and the imaginary contexts to generate predictions.
 This result clearly signposts a direction where further improvements are likely to be available.
 In large models, gt,k is a high dimensional vector.
 This model is an example of a teacher task on unstructured inputs.
 However weobserve a square root scaling rule when performing language modelling with an LSTM.
 Several desirable properties of such systems were shown, including improvements in decoding speed and code length.
 (b) A symbolic method based on human-designed sets of hints (Veroff, 1996) was previously successfully applied in abstract algebra by Kinyon et al., (2013) to discover long proofs and we wanted to check whether learning of long proofs is feasible using the state-of-the-art ML toolset.
 This is accomplished by first using a neural network to map configurations to a different space in which the structural constraints can be compactly encoded, and then applying the SL to the latter.
 This leads to the degradation in the quality and diversity of samples.
 We observe that the required ability to quantify the semantic/syntactic distance of latent codes z to the training data directly corresponds to the ability to detect outliers in latent space Z.
 To evaluate the learning effectiveness and efficiency, we develop a small (≤ 1,024 subgraph isomorphisms in each graph) and a large (≤ 4,096 subgraph isomorphisms in each graph) dataset and evaluate different neural network architectures.
 To the best of our knowledge it is the first `0 embedded feature selection method.
 Domain knowledge can be incorporated through transformations between related objects (§3.3).
 Furthermore, Ovadia et al., (2019) and Gustafsson et al., (2019) independently benchmarked existing methods for uncertainty quantification on a variety of datasets and architectures, and observed that ensembles tend to outperform approximate Bayesian neural networks in terms of both accuracy and uncertainty, particularly under dataset shift.
In this paper, we propose an actor-critic algorithm that leverages differentiable simulation and combines the benefits of model-based methods and DRL.
 Based on these findings, we propose a simple autoencoder-based off-policy method that can be trained end-to-end.
 The approach relies on finding the singular vectors of a linearly approximated network (Section 3.1).
 Specifically, we show that larger networks result in smaller prediction bias, but small networks can still generalize well, especially when the dataset is sufficiently structured, but typically incur a larger bias.
1The all-pay auction literature sometimes refers to the principal as the auctioneer.
 Task 3 finally tackles the pixel-wise classification of the instances.
 Note that other high-impact applications have also been reformulated as the extreme classification of short text documents such as queries, webpage titles, etc.
 At inference time, we solve this problem by a variation of beam search that “merges” rays in the beam that generate the same output by different means.
 2.However this is not the only benefit.
 More recently, Chang et al., (6) proposed a way to learn an optimal kernel representation for CPD by using an auxiliary generative model.
 There is a belief that generative approaches are more suited to abstract inputs such as language wordpieces but not for less abstract entities like pixels or audio waveform bits (van den Oord et al., 2018; Hjelm et al., 2018; Bachman et al., 2019; Trinh et al., 2019).
 In order to answer this question, we also propose pixel-level OOD detection performance metrics, drawing both onexisting image-level OOD detection and semantic segmentation performance metrics.
 (3) When data of multiple modalities are naturally available for same events in a system, a robust and precise algorithm needs to be designed to integrate these information for system diagnosis or decision making.
 This extra term, implemented by the proposed reward function, helps the agent to explore better at the vicinity of the references.
 These include deep unfolding methods which design neural networks to learn approximations of iterative optimization algorithms.
We compose free-form and structured filters, as shown in Figure 1, and learn both end-to-end.
 In the context of deep learning however, such combinations are scarce (Wang et al., 2017) and have even been found harmful in cases (Ducoffe & Precioso, 2018).
 Here, we utilize the attribute to describe the property of each test entity for the NER task (i.g,, entity length).
 Metro network, an important transportation system, has a great influence on social equity.
 In particular, Conditional Variational AutoEncoders (CVAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (proposed by Goodfellow et al., (2014)), and its variants have gained significant attention in non-parallel VC.
 (2) Multi-object recognition in images: Given just the embedding of an image xa, answer whether xa contains the object(s) in another image xb.
 Therefore, we address the following question in this paper: Can we mitigate the domain bias problem of GZSL in the relation-based manner and achieve high performance?We first discuss the importance of the following requirements for good relation-based ZSL performance when embedding images and attributes in a shared representation space that satisfies the following requirements: images and attributes belonging to the same class must be in the same place (modality invariance); and different classes of samples must be separated in the shared space (class separability).
 This paper proposes Monte Carlo Deep Neural Network Arithmetic (MCDA), a novel way to apply Monte Carlo Arithmetic (MCA) (Parker et al., 2000) for determining the sensitivity of Deep Neural Networks to Q-FP representations.
 See (Arora et al., 2019).
 Therefore, a new class of DNN architecture is necessary for autonomous system that is inherently resilient to input perturbations of different type and magnitude without requiring training on noisy data, as well as computationally efficient.
Similarity between training and test distribution: Another strategy would be to ensure that the training and test distribution match which has been investigated in a number of diverse settings (Tzeng et al., 2017; Arjovsky et al., 2017).
 We rely on the Gumbel-softmax reparameterization method (Jang et al., 2017) in order to train these binary variables jointly with the parameters of the components.
 See Figure 1 for an illustration, where the image is illustrated by the big rectangle.
 These constraints enable the agent to interact with a human or other agents and generate various styles without retraining the model.
 Like MAML, OCMAML yields model parameters that are easily adaptable to unseen tasks.
’ We limit the self-supervision to the data at-hand, and focus on self-supervised auxiliary tasks relevant to sequential data ordered by time (i.g,, time-series data).
 Our contribution is twofold.
Specifically, we partition the neural state si ∈ Rd into a number of node blocks.
 Indeed, in practical scenarios, the communication time required to share stochastic gradients and parameters is the main performance bottleneck (Recht et al., 2011; Li et al., 2014; Seide et al., 2014; Strom, 2015; Alistarh et al., 2017).
Together this work offered a significant advance to our understanding of wide neural networks; however, this theoretical progress was limited to networks at initialization or after Bayesian posterior estimation and provided no link to gradient descent.
 Our approach relies on neural networks to estimate Wasserstein distances between the sample spaces for different classes and the sample spaces for events that we call environments.
We test our approach on classic benchmarks for orthogonal RNNs, showing that our proposed approach behaves similarly to orthogonal architectures on pure memorization tasks, and even improving the performance on real-world datasets.
 No learnable parameters are attached.
Recent works have studied applying sparse attention in Transformer model.
Theoretical work of this nature is important because it allows for more straightforward transfer and adaptation of prior theoretical results to new contexts of interest.
 In other words, recognition systems (e.g, image classifier or object detector), should be able to accurately explain the underlying semantic meaning of the image content.
 However, reconstructing the missing information in videos when supervision is unavailable is still an open problem and there have been only a few works exploring this direction.
 Each head is assigned to an ensemble memberdistillation to ensemble models Hinton et al., (2015) train a network to imitate the average ensemble prediction.
 Minimizing the reverse KL divergence instead will try to avoid any behaviour that is unlikely under true distribution at the cost of ignoring modes of true distribution completely, thus it is good at quality.
 The uncertainty is quantified by a risk measure, which is then utilized by a planner to guide exploration.
 We conduct both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on CelebA dataset (Liu et al., 2015).
 Compared with previous hybrid methods, EI has following advantages:
 Specifically, we train KERMIT on the Multi30K (Elliott et al., 2016) machine translation task, consisting of four lan-guages: English (EN), French (FR), Czech (CS), and German (DE).
Based on all of our findings, we propose the Adaptive Filter Graph Neural Network (AF-GNN), which can adaptively learn a proper model for the given graph.
 Considered in this broader sense, meta-learning seems indispensable, making HIDS relevant for all machine learning practitioners.
However, all the aforementioned FMs variants only focus on the feature interaction.
 It is thus inherently reasonable to take these features into account for prediction-based methods.
 Our approach is built on two core insights: 1) The temporal occurrence of frames or segments in a video provides vital visual information required to reason about the presence of an event; 2) The semantics of the query are integral to reasoning about the relationships between entities in the video.
 These energies are determined at the electronic ground-state at given positions of atoms for static systems.
To our knowledge, not only is this the first work regarding the protection of policies in reinforcement learning, but it is also the first to represent adversarial experts.
 In summary, the key contributions of this work are:
 In particular, we investigate two sampling strategies in the latent space, namely sampling by nearest neighbor (SNN) and sampling by interpolation (SI) for different applications.
 In RL, SA could be regarded as a model that can accurately aware current situation, internally represent the complex dynamics and covering enough latent information like constraints.
 Our contribution is threefold:
 Measuring these intersections allows us to recover the weights between the corresponding neurons.
 After training, the network can be provided with a camera image of the current environment and a natural language description of the intended task.
 However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, few of the data-driven SR algorithms have been proposed for structured SR problems.
However, this approach has severe scalability issue since it needs to learn N2 number of (Bernoulli) random variables to model joint probability distribution on the edges of the graph consisting of N number of vertices.
 First, it randomly assigns the classes in the nodes to binary pseudo labels and equalizes the sizes of two pseudo classes by randomly removing data in the larger class.
Here, all possible signals an attacker can obtain are captured using an abstraction s(i) (a convex relaxation).
 The prediction of the DBNN is given by a Monte Carlo (MC) estimator for distributions of data streams and weights.
 The number of saddles can grow exponentially in neural network landscapes (Auer et al., 1996; Dauphin et al., 2014; Choromanska et al., 2015).
 Specifically, we select a set of corresponding layers from the student and teacher networks.
 For instance, the top-5 nearest neighbors (NN) of apple (below) in the embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013) space suggest that it refers to a fruit; however, they do not express anything about its thematic context, e.g, Health.
 We study agent’s performance on the current task (the environment which the agent is trained on), rather than its generalization ability to different environments as many recent works (Zhang et al., 2018a; Zhao et al., 2019; Farebrother et al., 2018; Cobbe et al., 2018).
 We utilize scribble based annotations from human annotators as initialized or iterative hard constraints for our algorithms, which is typical in a human-in-the-loop (HITL) annotation process.
 Second, distribution discrepancy between real and generated samples makes GR-based methods hard to address complex natural images such as CIFAR (Krizhevsky & Hinton (2009)) or ImageNet (Deng et al., (2009)).
Different from learning primitive skills, our learning process considers two arbitrary primitive skills and multiple transitional skills between them, where both primitive and transitional skillls are unknown and to be learned.
 Unbiased: Avoid dependence on human priors, such as language or spatio-temporal biases.
 We evaluate our proposed architectures and loss functions using thorough ablation studies both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Our novelties can be summarized in four items
 We find that the failure of previous methods on weight pruning of BERT is possibly due to the inaccurate sparse pattern learnt from the simple `1 or `2 based sparsitypromoting regularizer.
 However, unlike GQN which provides only a scene-level representation that encodes the whole 3D scene into a single continuous vector, the scene representation of ROOTS is decomposed into objectwise representations each of which is also an independent, modular, and 3D representation.
 Different from training inside a data center, long-distance distributed training suffers from high latency, which proposes a severe challenge to scale across the world.
 In images of human faces for instance, skin– and hair color will likely dominate over other subtle features like facial expression in terms of the `2-norm.
 Recently, the distributional stability of a deep neural network attracts extensive attention (Santurkar et al., 2018).
 Our final fully differentiable forward dynamics model is able to sample multiple, more accurate and more stable trajectories over long-time horizons compared to existing baselines.
To address these limitations, we propose to explore relational information on a different dimension – the relations between feature attributes, in addition to node relations.
 An alternative way to remove pixels is to use sampling from some predefined distribution or a generative model (Chang et al., 2018), which nevertheless could still introduce some bias with respect to the defined distribution.
 This renderer produces fake images by taking the 3D mesh, its texture, a background image and a viewpoint as its input.
 Thiseliminates forgetting altogether but requires growing the network after each task and can cause the architecture complexity to grow with the number of tasks.
 A population is sampled from this distribution of genotypes, and it experiences a sequence of inputs to the brain circuit.
Disentangling syntax from lexical semantics in word representations is a desired property for several reasons.
 But explanations in the theoretical aspect, if any, are to some extent restricted.
 Traditional results from stochastic optimization focus on the asymptotic analysis, but in practice, most of deep neural networks are only trained for hundreds of epochs due to the high computational cost.
 First, set K = KL  q(z |x) || p(z)  and stochastically draw independent samples (z1, . ,zdexp{K}e) from p(z).
 A classification function with high rugosity, particularly near the true class boundaries, will likely have an unstable decision boundary, especially for noisy observations off of the data manifold.
 Besides, the state novelty can also be measured by empowerment (Klyubin et al., 2005), the agent’s belief of environment dynamics (Houthooft et al., 2016), prediction error of the system dynamics model (Pathak et al., 2017; Stadie et al., 2015), prediction by exemplar model (Fu et al., 2017), and the error of predicting features of states (Burda et al., 2018).
 However, conventional reinforcement learningalgorithms utilize the available actions in a way that best optimizes a reward.
 This results in a final classifier which can be compared against different semi-supervised algorithms.
 For example, consider a task of maze navigation, with a TV placed in the maze, displaying images (Burda et al., 2018a).
 To provide thorough adversarial text quality assessment, we also perform 7 groups of human studies to evaluate the quality of generated adversarial text compared with the baselines methods, and whether human can still get the ground truth answers for these tasks based on adversarial text.
 Finally, the agent will probably explore the whole state space to find the optimal policy.
 There are other methods of learningan encoder for GAN in the adversarial way such as (Dumoulin et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017; Ulyanov et al., 2017; Heljakka et al., 2018).
 By iteratively mutual enhancement, our framework can notonly perform better on multiple tasks, but also can extract high-quality dependency structures at different levels, which can reveal some hidden knowledge of the datasets.
 Moreover, such transfer of potentially large datasets also incurs severe communication costs.
 When training models to defend against undersensitivity attacks with data augmentation and adversarial training, we observe that they can generalise their robustness to held out evaluation data without sacrificing standard performance.
 The full curvature correction effect of natural gradient descent (NGD) completely linearizes the map learning dynamics of deep networks, equivalent to that of shallow networks.
 We propose AGMC-HTS, an Adversarial Generative Model Conditioned on code descriptions with Hierarchical Tree Structure to generate synthetic feature.
 One may however expect to learn not only an interpolator but also some representation of considered data, which may be of interest for other applications.
 In recent works (Li et al., 2017; Shaban et al., 2017; Rusu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019), few-shot learning approaches have become increasingly complex and appear to be specialized to the few-shot domain.
 While these works demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy for reducing the wall time for training large deep neural networks, they also highlight the need for an adaptive learning rate mechanism for large batch learning.
 Such conduct of training would impede to learn stable neural representations and further mislead the consensus of the predictions.
 Recent works have started to explore various means of utilizing the answer information.
 The main contribution of this work is twofold.
 In addition, we generalize our method by incorporating the graph topological information so that our method can control the clique set in our CRFs.
Note that Eq.
 The between-node relations are structured as the integration of node attributes, connection paths, and graph topological structures.
 Intuitively, our method accomplishes (a) by training the agent using an extremely sparse reward function – +1 for demonstrations, 0 everywhere else – and accomplishes (b) by training the agent with RL instead of supervised learning.
 As discussed in the following sections, these design choices are critical to obtain state-of-the-art performance.
The classification and triplet losses are commonly adopted together to achieve state-of-the-art performances in both fully-supervised (Luo et al., 2019) and unsupervised (Zhang et al., 2019b; Yang et al., 2019) person re-ID models.
 Crucially, this objective does not leverage the known labels, resulting in features that are much less biased towards the labelled∗indicates equal contributionclasses.
 Weighted Double Q-learning (Zhang et al., 2017) uses a weighted combination of the Double Q-learning estimate, which likely has underestimation bias, and the Q-learning estimate, which likely has overestimation bias.
 Inspired by our theoretical results, we propose an efficient adaptation algorithm based on adversarial adaptation and representation disentanglement applied to the federated setting.
 We experiment with two approaches to address this and show that a simple approach works well (§2).
 The piece-wise formulation protects larger elements by having zero penalty to elements greater than a predefined threshold.
 Investigating this further allowed us to identify that weight sharing (Pham et al., 2018), widely adopted to reduce the amount of required resources from thousands of GPU days to a single one, harms the individual networks’ performance.
 In particular, we use the expected cardinality of the DPP as the diversity measure, which is defined as the expected size of a random subset drawn from the set of trajectory samples according to the DPP.
Technically, it is difficult to analyze the regularizations as some commonly used convex regularizers are nonsmooth, for example, `1-norm.
 In contrast to previous approaches, LAMOL needs no extra generator (right of Figure 1).
 But they only consider the rule-based followers, i.g,, followers with fixed preference, and ignore the followers’ behaviors responding to the leader’s policy, which significantly simplifies the problem and leads the unreasonability of the model.
 To effectively make use of graph structural knowledge, one would need a feature with more discriminative power; one that can distinguish these three scenarios in Figure 1.
 In this space, a test sample’s distance to its ground-truth class center can calibrate the model’s performance.
 low-rank approximation proves powerful in easing the computational burden (Gartrell et al., 2017), in which the gram matrix is factorized as L = BB> where B ∈ <n×m with m n.
The proposed meta-learning framework is named as Automated Relational Meta-Learning (ARML).
 First, AdVIL introduces a variational encoder to infer the latent variables, which provides an upper bound of the free energy.
 In some prior work (Zhou et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018a; Mishra et al., 2018; Choi, 2018), they either leave bias and scaling factors unquantized or keep the first and last layer in full or high precision.
 However, this exhaustive annotation process is tedious, time consuming and more importantly not a part of clinical workflow.
To handle these practical challenges, we propose a novel continual learning model with Additive Parameter Decomposition (APD).
 All parameters are learnt via variational inference.
 The attack uses these learned distributions to generate targeted (or untargeted) adversarial examples by maximizing (or minimizing) the probability that the adversarial example is from a particular class feature distribution (Figure 1(bottom)).
 Instead of directly constructing a solution from the problem instance (Graves et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014; Vinyals et al., 2015), we propose a framework that iteratively searches among solutions, until a certain termination condition is satisfied.
 Kernel-wise network quantization assigning a QBN to each weight kernel and searching a QBN for each activation layer of a CNN becomes a must to enable the efficient deployment of deep CNNs on mobile devices by reducing the inference computing overhead.

In this work, we present an alternative approach that we call Editable Training.
 First, instead of using high level source code, we construct a new graph representation of low-level assembly code and model it with a graph neural network.
 To further balance between accuracy versus latency and avoiding collapsing towards either metric (e.g, good latency yet poor accuracy), we design a decoupled and fine-grained latency regularization, that facilitates a more flexible and effective calibration between latency and accuracy.
1In traditional machine learning scenarios, "unseen" data corresponds to data that is not used or seen during the training stage but rather the testing stage.

 Tacchetti et al., (2019) proposed a novel network architecture called Relational Forward Model (RFM) for predictive modeling in multiagent learning.
In order to enable this, the following challenges are to be addressed: (1) replacing the background requires the system to separate the character from the surroundings, which is not handled by previous work, since they either embed the character into the same learned background, or paste the generated character into the background with noticeable artifacts, (2) the separation is not binary, and some effects, such as shadows, blend the character’s motion effect with that background information, (3) the control signal is arbitrary, and can lead the character to poses that are not covered by the training set, and (4) generated sequences may easily drift, by accumulating small errors over time.
 We adopt randomized smoothing because it is scalable to large-scale neural networks and applicable to any base classifier.

 As a matter of fact, the evaluation of a model goes through two different phases, namely model selection on the validation set and model assessment on the test set.
 As in earlier analyses for the fully connected case, our bounds are in terms of the distance from the initial weights, and the number of parameters.
 The intuition behind this is to exploit the non-explicit and latent inter-class relationships between graphs via their spectral measures and use a GNN on this to also introduce a relational inductive bias (Battaglia et al., 2018), which in turn affords us an improved sample complexity and hence better combinatorial generalization given such few samples to begin with.

 Therefore, instead of treating a conditional image generation network as a deterministic function with fixed parameters, we propose modeling the filter in each convolutional layer as a sample from filter space, and learning the corresponding filter space using a tiny network for efficient and diverse filter sampling.
 Nonetheless, we find that some degree of transformation is possible.
 In semantic segmentation, this would translate into labelling a single region per step.
 The literature of the first theme primarily divides into white-box and black-box settings.

 In particular, we vastly outperform behavioral cloning using the same set of demonstrations in all of our experiments.
 In this paper, we focus on the EB model, as it largely simplifies the training and testing without losing the strength of the HB formulation.
 Such supervision can be easily obtained in practice e.g, tracking an object in a video obtains multiple images in multiple poses of the same class (for example, person identity).
 We show empirically that cross-validation is an effective heuristic for assessing the model quality, which is simpler than the inference required by Bayesian optimization.
In light of the above limitations, we propose a query efficient black-box attack that iteratively optimises over both the adversarial perturbation and the effective dimensionality of the latent search space.
 To this end, we formulate and tackle a new few-shot RL problem called subtask graph inference problem, where the task is defined as a factored MDP (Boutilier et al., 1995; Jonsson & Barto, 2006) with hierarchical structure represented by subtask graph (Sohn et al., 2018) where the task is not known a priori.

 Neyshabur et al., (2019) proved generalization bounds for two layer ReLU feedforward networks, which decreased with the increasing number of hidden unit in the network.
 Cache side-channel attacks are ubiquitous and difficult to defeat as they are inherent to the micro architectural design of modern CPUs (Werner et al., 2019).
 A single feed-forward pass in ANN corresponds to multiple forward passes in SNN which is proportional to the number of time steps.
 MMA-IL emphasizes the quality of the translation system.
 We observe empirically that our model with the gradient features outperforms the traditional activation-based logistic regressor by a significant margin in all settings.
 As the source domain encompasses the target, many neurons responsible for extracting features from the source domain may become irrelevant to the target domain and can be removed.
It has been demonstrated both empirically and theoretically that LISTA is superior to ISTA (Wang et al., 2016; Moreau & Bruna, 2017; Giryes et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018).
 The rate of the distance between the output and the invariant space is O((sλ)L) where s is the maximum singular values of weights, λ is typically a quantity determined by the spectra of the (augmented) normalized Laplacian, and L is the layer size.
 Another common approach to unsupervised representation learning on graphs is through graph kernels Pržulj (2007); Kashima et al., (2003); Orsini et al., (2015).
 This implies that gradients from the skip connections are more vulnerable (high success rate).
 The proposed method was evaluated on four widely-used translation datasets, including the WMT’16 Englishto-Romanian, WMT’14 English-to-German, WMT’14 English-to-French, and Multi30K which are standard corpora for NMT and multimodal machine translation (MMT) evaluation.
 On the other hand, domain generalization methods have been developed (Blanchard et al., 2011; Li et al., 2019) to learn classifiers that generalize well to multiple unseen domains without requiring the access to data from those domains.
 Selective synaptic plasticity, by itself, could not fully overcome intransigence.
 The proposed formulation is a minimax problem that admits a simple reduction to cost-sensitive learning.
 DoS-based strategies (e.g, Goetschalckx & Ratliff (1990), Chen et al., (2016)) assign pallets to locations with travel distance proportional to the duration-of-stay.
 Our work aims to answer the question of what are the node classifiers that can be captured by GNN architectures such as AC-GNNs.
 Our contributions are:
 As a result, the process of designing such systems is often heuristic.
 However, current undirected exploration methods scale poorly with environment complexity and are drastically different from the way organisms evolve on Earth.
 In this way, architecture search is transformed into the problem of searching a good cell.
 For example, if multiple people have discussion about given documents, knowledge selection of previous turns is done by others.
 We realize this encoding via a novel method which meta-learns a neural AF, i.g,, a neural network representing the AF, on a set of source tasks.
 After labeling it as positive, he can easily generalize it to a rule Contains ’highly recommend’ → positive label.
 DimeNet can learn both molecular properties and atomic forces.
 The complexity of deep neural network model is regulated from several aspects.
 Therefore, our main goal in this work is to shed some theoretical light on the generalization gap problem and use it to improve A-SGD training.
 As already noted in Khemakhem et al., (2019), flow-based generative models are a natural fit for the theory of nonlinear ICA, as are the variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma &Welling, 2013) used in that work.
 Another important type of structure is sparsity; lots of exciting recent work has focused on the design of sparse neural networks.
 Our observations seem to coincide with the recent findings by (Achille et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019) about the two-stage optimization trajectory in training.
 As shown by our experiments, such structural information often contains clues regarding topology patterns in graph (e.g, hierarchy), and should be extracted and used to learn more discriminating representations for graph-structured data.
 The main contributions of this work are:
 The data available locally fail to represent the overall distribution.
A variety of work has alleviated the above MLE training shortcomings apart from negative diversity ignorance.
 With such a large search space, an effective branching strategy could mean a large reduction of the total number of branches required, and consequently of the time required to solve a problem.
 Our scheme leverages Matrix Estimation (ME), a theoretically guaranteed framework for recovering low-rank matrices from noisy or incomplete measurements (Chen & Chi, 2018).
 Additionally, we find that these optimizations are both necessary and sufficient to maintain a trust region, regardless of whether or not the clipping algorithm—typically thought to be the central algorithm of PPO—is employed.
We validate our model on CIFAR-FS and miniImageNet dataset, as well as a new dataset that consists of heterogeneous datasets, under a scenario where every class in each episode can have any number of shots, that leads to task and class imbalance, and where the dataset at meta-test time is different from that of meta-training time.
 Pseudoknots make up roughly 1.4% of base-pairs (Mathews & Turner, 2006), and are overrepresented in functionally important regions (Hajdin et al., 2013; Staple & Butcher, 2005).
 Moreover, low-dimensional representations of patterns are needed for human browsing and the visualization of the discoveries.
 The bottleneck is inserted into an existing neural network and restricts the information flow by adding noise to the activation maps.
 This happens by using a set of trainable neural networks that the shallower capsules are given as input into.
 The code for our metrics is publicly available online1.
 (iii) NPs rely on embedding sets into a finite-dimensional vector space for which the notion of equivariance with respect to input translations is not natural, as we detail in Section 3.
 The distinctions between the proposed method and IRL are threefold: First, instead of learning a reward function of state s, we learn a scoring function of a local state sl and an action a, which is sufficiently rich in a physical environment and experimentally can generalize well.
 Motivated by a few recent works (Lei & Jordan, 2017; Lei et al., 2017; Allen-Zhu, 2017) that focus on the stochastically controlled gradient, we were inspired to look for a way to improve the query complexity and reduce the dependence on n to solve the composition optimization in (1.1).
 This novel approach recovered the results of Montufar et al., (2014) with a much simpler analysis.
 We show that incorporating projective spatial memory enables the agent to learn policies that exceed the performance of a standard recurrent agent.
 The motivating principle behind step (i.) is to learn the low dimensional geometric summaries of the inputs via statistical inference.
Regarding examples weighting, there is a core research question which is not well answered yet: What training examples should be focused on and how large the emphasis spread should be?In this work, we present a thorough study of this practical question under different settings.
 Today, data augmentation is an almost ubiquitous technique in deep learning, which can also be regarded as an implicit regularizer for it improves generalization.
 2: Sample yi ∼ Unif(b, a) 3: Set yi := xi ∗ yi 4: Compute ST gradient ∂θi := ∂yif(y) 5: Importance reweighing ∂θi := 0.5/p(xi) · ∂θi 6: return partial gradient γ∂θi , i = 1, …,Kdistributions p(z).
 In this way, we project each data point twice instead of four times.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
One of the fundamental challenges to fit a locally interpretable model is the representational capacity difference while applying distillation.
 It is straightforward to address at the full dataset granularity: one could naively train a model on the entire dataset and use its prediction performance as the value.
 As far as we know, this is the first paper to propose domain-independent style transfer (note that this kind of approach is flexible for arbitrary images in arbitrary domains, while existing so-called arbitrary style transfer methods are only flexible for arbitrary images in specific domains), and also the first attempt to combine multiple existing approaches directly to improve the quality and flexibility of style transfer.
 In other words, we human naturally recognize the object in the visual scene without enumerating the candidate boxes.
 These trends reflect the great impact of topology on theoptimization of neural networks.
For solving (1), Goodfellow et al., (2014b) propose to use FGSM to solve the inner problem.
 Since images tend to have more spatial patterns, most existing deep image priors have focused on how to encapsulate the spatial redundancy.
Specifically, we summarize the class prototypes from all instances according to their predictions.
 These methods are more focused on efficiently exploring novel states instead of controlling states of interest.
 In particular, the virtual user contains a reward estimator and a feedback generator: the reward estimator estimates rewards based on the fused inputs (the compatiblerepresentation of the user observation and its recommended items), learned with a generative adversarial regularizer.
 We contrast the ease of arriving at such conclusions using our representation against methods used in previous work 12, 15, 13, 6.
A natural objective for training against attacks sampled from a distributionD, that bypasses the need for data augmentation, is the expected loss under this distribution.
 However, Gowal et al., (2019) recently demonstrated that robustly training large networks is possible by leveraging the cheap-to-compute but very loose interval-based verifier, known as interval domain from Mirman et al., (2018).
 The authors argued that the network learned these representations in order to co-activate multiple letters or words at the same time in short-term memory without producing ambiguous blends of overlapping distributed patterns (the so-called ‘superposition catastrophe’).
 Besides, (Urbanczik & Senn, 2009) proposed a novel leaning rule whose information will be embedded into the spatio-temporal information during learning of the spike signals.
 This is in part because normalization methods completely change the optimization landscape during training.
 Yet the direct output of encoder zv of GraphSAGE could be located anywhere.
 As a result, FALCON and FALCON-branch provide a superior accuracy compared to other methods based on depthwise separable convolution, with similar compression and computation reduction rates, and rank-k FALCON further improves accuracy, outperforming even the original convolution in many cases.
 The ‘sticking-the-landing’ IWAE (IWAE-STL) φ-gradient (Roeder et al., 2017) heuristically drops the problematic score-function terms from the IWAE φ-gradient.
 This makes runtime approaches not applicable on resource-limited edge devices.
 In the third stage, the unlabeled images are used as inputs to the proposed system to generate the labels.
 One recent work by Wang et al., firstly proved the convergence guarantee of ADMM in the fully-connected neural network problem (Wang et al., (2019)).
 This is of high importance when synthesizing images having many instances of the same semantics in a single frame.
 WaveGAN is the direct descendant of DCGAN with modification for the 1D audio data, while GANSynth applied the concept of progressive generation of audio, but using the 2D spectrogram, treating the audio as a 2D image.
 Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
 Finally, beyond fusion itself, super-resolved generation is required throughout the technical stack: both for labeling, but also for human oversight (Drexler, 2019) demanded by legal context (Harris et al., 2018).
 By transferring the learned graph embeddings and placement policies, we are able to achieve faster convergence and thus use less resources to obtain high-quality placements.
 This challenges previous experimental results and requires understanding of how influential isomorphic instances on the final performance of the models.
 These stages can be easily identified in learning curves (such as Figure 1(b)), where the performance boosts sharply shortly after the learning rate is decayed.
 In this case, if we train the overparameterized teacher network until convergence, the network’s output coincides exactly with the ground truth hard labels.
 Other works examine neighbors of each data point directly.
 The remaining analysis is done on the lower bound.
In this work, we address these concerns using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
 Recent research (Pascanu et al., 2013b; Montufar et al., 2014) has shown that deep neural networks are more expressive while stacking up the nonlinear activation with more layers.
 Specifically, in Setting (i), our method STR1 employs a newly proposed estimator to approximate the Hessian and adopts the estimator in (Fang et al., 2018) for gradient approximation.
 Further, for prediction with time-series data, loss may not be available at every timestep.
As the location of the layer normalization plays a crucial role in controlling the gradient scales, we investigate whether there are some other ways of positioning the layer normalization that lead to better-normalized gradients.
 According to our theory, we can easily explain why BatchNorm with ReLU is powerful with but ineffective with Sigmoid and Tanh as activation functions, which may help us to better understand the underlying complexity of neural networks.
 However, their analysis impractically assumes qφ(a|z) = p(a|z), so little is known about the practical behavior of AII and how to improve it.
 We illustrate this behavior in fig.

 At the localization stage, each word generated by the first decoding stage is localized through a localizer, and the resulting grounded image region(s) are then used to reconstruct the ground-truth caption in the final stage.
 In our mech-anism, privacy-preserving noise is injected into inputs and hidden layers to achieve DP in learning private model parameters (Theorem 1).
 In particular, we make the following contributions:
{xk = f(xk−1) + g(xk−1)wk−1, yk = h(xk) + vk, (1)where the state xk at time instant k is an n-dimensional vector, f is an n-dimensional vectorvalued function, g is an n × r matrix-valued function, {wk, k = 0, 1, · · · } is an r-dimensional white Gaussian process and wk ∼ N (0, Q), where Q is the covariance matrix of wk.
 However, in practice we found that the model had poor performance on non-homologous test data, that is, the generalization ability of the above model is very weak.
 We will summarize more related works in Section 4.
While both expert designed and NAS searched models have produced remarkable efficiency and prediction performance, they have neglected one critical issue that would affect inference efficiency.
 We evaluate the performance of our approach for 1© the problem of recovering the basis functions that created a given texture,2© classification of handwritten digits in cluttered scenes, and 3© recognition of house numbers in real-world environments.
 For both of them, we focus on certifying robustness in either `2 or `∞ norm by randomized smoothing.
 We approximately solve the optimization problem using one-step stochastic gradient descent with the standard gradient replaced by the proposed mixed stochastic gradient.
 We therefore propose gradient reversion (GREV) attack, which is a principled way for attacking episodic memory based lifelong learning algorithms such as A-GEM.
 Graph-based neural net-works (GNN) (Kipf & Welling, 2016; Defferrard et al., 2016; Veličković et al., 2017) are proved to be powerful tools in modelling spatial-temporal network structures (Yu et al., 2018; Li et al., 2017).
Such adaptive regularization has been utilized for general network regularization by a non-Bayesian and non-sparsity-inducing model (Ba & Frey, 2013); yet, the increased memory and computational overheads that come from learning additional weights for dropout mask generation made it less appealing for generic network regularization.
 The Peaks-Over-Thresh (POT) method (Leadbetter, 1991) is utilized to model the excess of distance exceeding the threshold, and thus very useful in fitting the data for GPD.
 This growing NFEs issue has been observed in unconditional CNF but to a much lesser extent (Grathwohl et al., 2018).
 In this paper, we first study the effectiveness of typical quantization methods on GAN models.
 Though our ultimate goal is to minimize the former distance, the latter one is what we minimize in practice.
 It appears reasonable to analyze multiple aspects with a multi-task learning setting, but a model must be trained as many times as the number of aspects.
 The shallow models are hard to capture the hierarchical, high-level, long distance or global features form texts, which is why the models are limited..
 Another problem is the convergence of the training algorithm of GANs, especially the global convergence.
 In Kidziński & Hastie (2018), authors use concurrent observations of auxillary variables (e.g, oxygen consumption to motor functions) to help estimate the target one, under the assumption that both variables reflect the intrinsic latent feature of the disease and are thus correlated.
As a starting point, we focus on a particular type of biologically plausible learning rule for shallow networks known as AGREL (attention-gated reinforcement learning, reviewed in Richards et al., (2019)) and AuGMEnT (attention-gated memory tagging) (Roelfsema & Ooyen, 2005; Rombouts et al., 2015).
However, in such cases, model-based planning algorithms should not suffer from the lack of expressivity, because they only use the learned, parameterized dynamics, which are easy to express.
 The training objective of (Huang et al., (2018); Lee et al., (2018)) is even more involved to handle the unsupervised setup.
 Second, to further encourage the weights of related adjacent spatial locations to be the same (e.g, parts of an object), we introduce a new attention mechanism: Total-Variation Sparse Attention (which we dub TVMAX), inspired by prior work in structured sparsity (Tibshirani et al., 2005; Bach et al., 2012).
 To this end, the PDEs are reformulated using backward stochastic differential equations.
 By enforcing a stricter limit on the perturbation at those positions with lower sound intensity in the time domain, our method can introduce negligible noise at silent and pausal positions (addressing (C1)).
 However, if one were to decay the learning rate when loss stagnates, the achieved test accuracy is considerably lower as compared to letting the high learning rate continue for longer, despite no apparent improvement in training loss.
 Specifically, given an error tolerance ε and1e.g, predicting whether a user of an SNS clicks an advertisement by GNNs in real-time (i.g,, when the user accesses).
 To release such burden, Daniel et.al.
Comparing to the existing subnetwork-based methods, the proposed method has several appealing properties: First, only a very small amount of additional trainable parameters are introduced to explicitly model each domain, i.g,, domain-specific bases.
 In this respect, models alleviating the need for costly annotations are key for a wide and efficient deployment of deep learning models in temporal localization applications.
 We extend NODE from the Euclidean domain to graphs and propose graph ordinary differential equations (GODE), where the message propagation on a graph is modeled as an ODE.
Current studies (Ghadimi & Lan, 2013; Nesterov & Spokoiny, 2015; Duchi et al., 2015; Ghadimi et al., 2016; Shamir, 2017; Liu et al., 2019) suggested that ZO methods typically agree with the iteration complexity of FO methods but encounter a slowdown factor up to a small-degree polynomial of the problem dimensionality.
 We use this idea to balance network sparsity and model accuracy.
 Neural networks, typically used for solving this problem, while being rather elementary, include a large number of embedding layers of significant size.
In this paper we take some of the first steps towards developing such an understanding of the Transformer.
 Given an input example, we first generate an entire model prediction sequence in parallel by conditioning on ground-truth history (equivalent to forward-pass of teacher-forcing).
 We also extend this approach by introducing parameterized mirrors, which work as different mirrors based on the given input words, to overcome a limitation using a single fixed mirror to represent complex transfer mappings for different words.
 Further, we show that adaptive methods in fact implicitly have such a clipping behavior, thereby providing a explanation for their superiority to SGD on BERT.
Most of the work combining generative models with chemical discovery has focused on molecules that can be represented in either 1 dimension (such as a SMILES string (Weininger, 1988)) or by leveraging a 2 dimensional representation of a molecule, such as a graph.
 To build a competitive TinyBERT, we firstly propose a new Transformer distillation method to distill the knowledge embedded in teacher BERT.
 This procedure avoids the aforementioned problems with Bayesian optimization NAS: the model is powerful enough to predict neural network accuracies, and there is no need to construct a distance function between neural networks by hand.
 Over the years, many methods to improve the quality of the generated data as well as the disentanglement of the representations have been suggested (Brock et al., 2018; Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018; Nguyen-Phuoc et al., 2019; Jeon et al., 2018).
 VAEs are easy to train, but their generation quality still lies far below that of GANs, as they tend to generate blurry images (Dosovitskiy & Brox, 2016).
 Our method combines the complementary strengths of both non-parametric techniques and parametric ones.
 This paper focuses on the feature extraction steps.
 For dis-similar language pairs, BI-SENT2VEC outperform their competitors by an even larger margin on all the tasks hinting towards the robustness of our method.
In this work, we propose the Graph Generative Model with Graph Attention Mechanism (GRAM) for generating graphs that is scalable in all three contexts, especially during training.
 More specifically, the proposed wrapper uses a deep learning model and introduces a Dirichlet layer as the fusion layer with the black-box.
but also in consecutive training epochs within the same run.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
 Note that its encoder-decoder part (φr, ψr) is just a simple multi-layer perceptron along the filter domain (i.g,, manifold learning), and it is sandwitched between forward and backward embedding (H,H†).
 Our main contributions are as follows:
 Our key idea is to design some dynamics that simultaneously exploit over-parameterized models and structural sparsity.
This paper proposes a method for the BoN task based on the Split Linearized Bregman Iteration (SplitLBI) (Huang et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2019), originally proposed by Huang et al., (2016) to learn high dimensional sparse linear models and found applications in medical image classification (Sun et al., 2017), computer vision (Zhao et al., 2018), and training neural networks (Fu et al., 2019).
 However, their system was not tested on corpus data and that makes the system inapplicable.
 The main challenge in our problem is that for each context there is a different reward, hence, a different optimal policy for each context.
 The single-head scenario is also notoriously harder than its multi-head counterpart (Chaudhry et al., 2018) and is the focus of the present work.
The principle of positron emission in industrial non-destructive fields is similar to medical imaging, but it has its own unique difficulties: the detection environment is more harsh, the sampling time isshort, and at the same time, due to the phenomenon of scattering and attenuation of photons, industrial positron imaging is obtained.
However, the coupling flow (Kobyzev et al., 2019) used in the GraphNVP has a serious drawback when applied to sparse graphs such as molecular graphs we are interested in.
 From a theoretical viewpoint, figuring out the extent to which we can reduce the computational complexity of deep neural networks is another important open question.
 In residual architectures, there are many alternative paths of varying lengths from input to output.
 This leads to a simple pruning criterion based on each neuron’s entropy value.
htmlimplied by the context of an utterance, is called implicature—a term coined by Grice (1975).
 One potential reason is when matching marginal distributions of source and target domains, samples from different classes can be mixed together, where the joint error becomes nonnegligible since no hypothesis can classify source and target at the same time.
 Thus, computing zt and zt+1 independently and computing żt from those point-estimates will lead to a potentially large error in calculation.
 One can imagine that such group comparison data may bear complex statistical patterns due to a combination of two underlying models: the interaction model which governs the effects of in-group interactions in determining the utility or preference of a group; and the comparison model which governs the statistical patterns of pairwise group comparison data.
it can be jointly optimized.
 Networks trained in such an online distillation way achieve results superior not only to the networks trained with the cross-entropy loss alone but also to those trained in conventional offline distillation manner from a pre-trained teacher network.
 Another line of works (Lipton et al., 2018a; Azizzadenesheli et al., 2019a) assume that only SLD exists (p(y) 6= q(y)) between two domains and the conditional feature distribution is invariant (p(x|y) = q(x|y)).
 Often, this scoring procedure requires reports from multiple peer agents, and x′ is chosen as a function of the reported samples from all other agents (e.g, the average across all the reported xs, or a randomly selected x).
Gradient perturbation comes with several advantages over output/objective perturbations.
 It was shown that modern deep networks tend to be over confident in their predictions (Guo et al., 2017).
 As an illustration of SABER, current state-of-the-art DRL algorithm Rainbow (Hessel et al., 2018) is benchmarked.
 The key idea is to modify the GAN framework (Goodfellow et al., 2014) to generate the unobserved counterfactual outcomes from a standard treatment-effect dataset.
 The runtime system uses the evaluation specification along with user-defined HW constraints as input to provision the evaluation, perform benchmarking, and generate reports.
 noisy) of its connections in the graph.
 Designing an efficiently computable, and unbiased gradient estimator by averaging its historical policy gradient is the key to MPO.
 By utilizing a technique such as early-stopping, a common technique to avoid overfitting, training tends to stop before the compression phase occurs (see Figure 1).
 While global model aggregation time in FURL increases linearly in the number of users, this is a significant reduction compared with other approaches (Smith et al., 2017; Sebastian Caldas, 2019) whose global aggregation time increases quadratically in the number of users.
 For example, YOPO estimated the gradient on the input by only propagating the first layer (Zhang et al., 2019a), and parallel adversarial training utilized multiple graphics computation units (GPUs) for acceleration (Bhat & Tsipras, 2019; Shafahi et al., 2019).
 These mismatches between the downsampled LR training data and real LR data (mobile-captured data) heavily restrict the performance of these learning-based algorithms.
 However, as shown qualitatively by Gu & Tresp (2019), gradients are not always able to capture differences between adversarial images and natural images (for an example see Figures 7 and 8 in Appendix D).
 After obtaining the grounding point information, we project the 2D point to 3D coordinate.
 This is supported by recent works that prescribe it (Chen et al., 2016; Kingma & Ba, 2014; Hinton et al.,2012; Reddi et al., 2019), and by the fact that most common softwares, such as PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017), declare β = 0.9 as the default value in their optimizer implementations.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
 Second, we switch to a large-scale experimental setting compared to what is typically used for AL experiments.
 To this end, the DAE is enforced to learn more robust representations that can exploit the underlying data structures across multiple scales.
Our contributions are two-fold.
 Finally, we observe that RPGANs allow the construction of generative models without nonlinearities, which can significantly speed up the generation process for fully-connected layers.
 The Gradient penalty WGAN (WGAN-GP) (Gulrajani et al., 2017) was more successful at this, by enforcing the constraint through a gradient norm penalization.
 In summary, we make the following contributions:
 Intuitively, if the current state is not included in the demonstration, the agent will learn to update the policy merely relying on the reshaped Q-value function.
 It is worthy of trying to explore and enhance the interrelations between object detection and instance segmentation.
 FleXOR implies fractional quantization bits for each layer that can be quantized with different bits.
 Our algorithm combines the memory and computational efficiency of multi-agent systems, which is achieved through action coordination with the theoretical rigour of online machine learning, allowing us to balance exploration versus exploitation optimally.
 We also propose new experiments to quantify the impact of the loss of the information contained in the logits on detection performances.
In this paper, we take the first step towards provable efficient contextual bandit algorithms based on deep neural networks.
 In this way, developers can quickly obtain an accurate DL model without having to perform costly full-scale testing many times.
 Secondly, each x maps to exactly one z in latent space, and there is no need for posteriors p(z |x).
 The method of generating point clouds at this stage no longer retrieves them from the object database, instead, most of them synthesize new objects based on learning objects.
 Zheng & Lapata (2019) advances upon TextRank by using BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) to compute sentence similarity and build graphs with directed edges decided by the relative positions of sentences.
 In order to avoid catastrophic forgetting induced by learning to generate on previously generated data, previous works even store a separate generative model per task (Farquhar & Gal, 2018), in analogy to the multi-head classifier.
 This implies that a low total correlation of sample distribution cannot guarantee a low total correlation of the mean representation.
 These challenges naturally raise a question: What limits the performance of generative approaches in semi-supervised learning?In this work, we propose One-stage Semi-suPervised Optimal Transport VAE (OSPOT-VAE) to address these challenges, which consists of two improvements: (1) a one-stage semi-supervised VAE model that unifies the generation and classification loss in one ELBO framework.
 Compared to other methods (such as AUROC or Brier scores) Bayes factors better distinguish improvements toconfidence for methods which are already quite accurate, as is the case for top 1 or top 5 uncertainty for image classification.
 Memory-based methods are the reigning state of the art, but remain a far-cry from the achievable performance by a simple multi-task learning baseline accessing all data at once.
 The idea of relying on modified training approaches, instead of augmented objective function, to encourage network behavior is commonly used for different problems.
By additionally sharing the replay buffer between both agents, we can accelerate the learning process of the image-based actor by training on better performing states that are more quickly discovered by the state-based actor due to its lower dimensional input that is invariant to visual randomisation.
 Examples of such methods include the interior point method and the barrier method.
 We then formulate our framework as an optimization problem found in many prior works such as meta-learning (Finn et al., 2017), noisy data filtering (Ren et al., 2018), and neural architecture search (Liu et al., 2019a), and demonstrate that our proposed update rules follow a direct differentiation of the scorer parameters to optimize the model loss on the dev set.
Since the PRW loss is computed over a similarity graph involving all the prototypes and unlabelled points in the episode, it takes a global view of the data manifold.
 We also find that robustness to synonyms can often be improved when pretrained encoders are combined with an additional (cross-modal) self-attention tuned to the agent’s environmental objectives.
The key idea behind TriMap stems from semi-supervised metric learning (Amid et al., 2016): Given an initial low-dimensional representation for the data points, the triplet information from the highdimensional representation of the points is used to enhance the quality of the embedding.
 The exact relationship, however, between flatness of the loss surface around local minima (measuring changes of the empirical error for perturbations in parameter space), robustness (measuring changes of the error for perturbations in eitherinput or feature space), and generalization (performance on unseen data from the target distribution) is not well-understood.
 Furthermore, heuristic behavior does not adapt to changing circumstances and would therefore not allow us to study how agent behavior changes in the presence of fake news.
Consider smart thermostats, whose goal is to maintain a specific temperature while minimizing electricity cost.
We denote out-of-distribution and out-of-dataset with the acronyms OOD and OOS, respectively.
 In recent years, we have seen various attempts of using deep learning to solve tasks such as variant calling (Poplin et al., 2018) or the discovery of DNA-binding motifs (Zou et al., 2018).
 Our pro-posed framework directly predicts subjective multinomial opinions of the test nodes in a graph,with the opinions following Dirichlet distributions with each belief probability as a class probability.
 Thus our goal is more aligned with the recently proposed Invariant Risk Minimization (Arjovsky et al., 2019), but imposes less constraints on the data collection process.
 In practice, however, TopK-SGD has a much faster convergence speed (in term of iterations) than SGD with Randk (RandK-SGD) as empirically shown in (Stich et al., 2018).
 This utility function takes into account both the mean and the variance of the value function estimate.
Finally, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation of the system compared to several strong baseline techniques.
 However, an arbitrary projection does not guarantee improving the robustness of the model, because there are a lot of mapping functions including non-robust ones from the raw input space to the low-dimensional space capable of minimizing the classification loss.
 Additionally, meta-VI can provide a good initialization of the variational parameters which reduces the training time remarkably.
 Furthermore, there is ample evidence to indicate that wider networks are easier to train (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016; Nguyen & Hein, 2017; Lee et al., 2019), and recent theoretical results suggest that the dynamics of SGD simplify considerably for very wide networks (Jacot et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019).
 We also evaluate UDA on standard semi-supervised learning benchmarks for vision such as CIFAR-10 and SVHN.
Contributions.
In summary, the main contributions of this work are as follows:
 However, if we could compute global bounds on the maximum curvature values of the classification network, one may be able to compute computationally-efficient lower bounds on the robustness certificate even for non-linear deep classifiers.
 Such architectures mean improved parameter efficiency because redundant operations and features can be consolidated and shared across a set of tasks.
 This ability to adapt and incorporate further learning through optimization on the environment reward is one key difference between our method and ex-isting imitation learning and Guided Policy Search (GPS) methods (Levine & Koltun, 2013).
 For example, decision tree learning (even with gradient boosting) does not utilize back-propagation into their inputs to use an error signal to guide efficient learning of complex data types.
 To solve the second challenge, we propose leveraging the attention transfer (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2017) idea to facilitate the search behaviour across this significantly larger network space via following the attention guidance of a pretrained teacher model.
 Given the relative costs of labeled and unlabeled data, such an analysis aids us in deciding how to best spend a given budget in acquiring labeled versus unlabeled data.
 Using the Wasserstein flow description, we also provide a simple explanation for why the convergence to teacher parameters with larger weight is much faster than to the ones with smaller weight.
 TF-Net applies scale separation to model different ranges of scales of the turbulent flow individually.
 We collect noisy labels using text-to-image and image-to-image search via Google Image Search.
In this work, we introduce two embedding-based models that perform link prediction in knowledge hypergraphs.
 Heuristically, making loss gradients small should make gradient based attacks more challenging.
 The digit ‘6’ consists of both learned information (curved edges) and missing information (straight edges on top).
1In this work, we seek to refocus the discussion about graph learning with node metadata.
 However, there has been much less work using program synthesis for question asking, which requires searching through infinitely many questions (where many questions may be informative) rather than producing a single correct answer to a question.
 With large-scale non-parallel corpus, the training of the sentence encoder and decoder are enhanced via additional self-reconstruction and back-translation objectives.
 Overall, CCAT allows to detect previously unseen adversarial examples, e.g, large perturbations, different Lp attacks or distal adversarial examples, by confidence thresholding, i.g,, detection.
 Through experiments on six different architectures, we demonstrate our method’s computational efficiency and higher certified accuracies on large perturbations compared to all current state-of-the-art certification based training methods.
 Related network embedding methods (Perozzi et al., 2014; Grover & Leskovec, 2016; Tang et al., 2015; Qiu et al., 2018) also implicitly factorize PMI matrices based on the probability of encountering each (context) node on a random walk from each starting node (Qiu et al., 2018).
 For example, assume there is a training example {SRC: “Die Landschaft am Meer ist wunderschn”, TRG: “Amazing view along the sea” }.
 Unlike those previous works that assume access to OOD examples and train an auxiliary classifier for identifying anomalous activity patterns, our method finds differences in activity patterns without requiring access to any OOD examples, and it works across architectures.
 In addition, we further propose a novel graph U-net with graph skips and dedicated graph deconvolution layers including both the edge and the node deconvolution layers.
 For tree search, we use the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) 5 expansion and selection methods.
More specifically, the context-aware module reformulates the iterative mean-field inference (Krähenbühl & Koltun, 2011) – a popular approximate inference method for CRF as a stack of common CNN layers.
 Nguyen & Verspoor (2019) propose a different, albeit similar end-to-end neural model which makes use of deep biaffine attention (Dozat & Manning, 2016).
 Our results are exactly reproducible (having been trained with fixed pseudorandom seeds), and an implementation of CoNAS will be made publicly available post-peer review.
 We refer readers to Sec.
 Based on this observation, one way to naturally improve interpretation is to prevent features extracted by different layers from mixing together.
 Therefore, the pruning used in this work can also be seen as an approach to CNN understanding (Bau et al., 2017; Zylberberg, 2017; Kindermans et al., 2017; Morcos et al., 2018).
 The disadvantage of current substitute black-box attacks is that they need pre-trained substitute models trained bythe same dataset with attacked model T (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2017; Goodfellow et al., 2015; Kurakin et al., 2017a) or a number of images to imitate the outputs of T to produce substitute networks (Papernot et al., 2017).
 In CNC, we define a new differentiable loss function equivalent to the expected normalized cuts objective.
5 days on 512 TPU v3 chips and the RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) costs 1 day on 1024 V100 GPUs.
 Other models learn the related information from irrelevant LR-HR images to obtain similar representations by unsupervised strategy.
 Specifically, we leverage the transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) to learn the subroutines underlying several common yet sophisticated algorithms from input/output execution traces.
Let’s assume we can approximately solve the latent MDPs to create an ensemble of policies as shown in Figure 1.
 These works address the problem of disconnected manifolds bysimultaneously training multiple generators and using established regularizations (Chen et al., 2016) to coax them into dividing up the space and learning separate manifolds.
 When no improvement is possible within the small neighborhood, the search turns into an enlarged neighborhood, where a reinforcement learning (RL) based method is used to identify a sample of promising actions, and iteratively choose one action to apply.
 We also propose using dropout to obtain uncertainty estimates of the target Qvalues, and use this lower bound to alleviate overestimation bias.
 For human beings, when asked to accomplish a complicated task, we rarely plan over the atomic steps directly towards the target goal.
 This seems reasonable as RNNs have been used in the past for sequential text-based tasks, e.g, sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2011).
 We validate our methods on two 2D segmentation tasks: kidney segmentation in transversal slices of CT scans and salient object segmentation.
 We call our model CuBERT, short for Code Understanding BERT.
 Furthermore, 2-QBF (QBF with only two alternative quantifiers) is ΣP2 -complete (Kleine Büning & Bubeck, 2009).
 In this regard, label smoothing offers an important solution that is invariant to the underlying architecture.
 Many prior works including Kingma & Dhariwal (2018); Atanov et al., (2019); Durkan et al., (2019); Kumar et al., (2019) implement multi-scale architecture in their flow models, but use static masking methods for factorization of dimensions.
 The resemblance in trajectories matters because we estimate policy gradient by generating rollouts; however, the one-step model learning adopted by many MBRL methods do not guarantee this.
 Even with the help of position embeddings, the signals at local positions can still be very weak as the number of other positions is significantly more.
Here we formulate the role-based alignment as consisting of the phases of formation discovery and role assignment.
Our contributions are:
 The resultant policy decides when to switch between the two rules based on the LP instance objective value and reduced costs at that time.
 Extending their work, we go further and posit that slot-wise transformations should be sparse and that the perception module should be learned jointly with the transition model.
 The definition of disentanglement in the literature is not precise, however many believe that a representation with statistically independent variables is a good starting point (Schmidhuber, 1992; Ridgeway, 2016).
However, these approaches either miss the connection between sub-actions or combine handicraft rules with a learning algorithm.
 Our key contributions are:
 For instance, Tsipras et al., (2018) show an example of an inherent tension between pursuits of accuracy and robustness when is large enough to change the true class.
We aim to complement the literature via studying whether we can aggregate classifiers better than majority voting even when majority opinion is wrong.
 3: for t = 0 to T − 1 do 4: Sample K perturbed vectors vkt ∼ N (0, Id) for each k ∈ K.
 As shown in fig.  1, the overall activation map of the proposed method is generated by decomposing the similarity along each image.
To tackle this problem, we propose Graph Enhanced Transformer(GET) framework that can enjoy the advantage of both graph-level representations and sequence-level representations.
 For example, when we stop collecting data, some subjects will still be alive, so we know they live at least as long as when we stopped collecting training data.
Our work builds upon existing methods in image-reconstruction-guided landmark learning techniques (Jakab et al., 2018; Lorenz et al., 2019).
 In order to ensure both frequentist coverage and discrimination, DJ constructs feature-dependent confidence intervals using the LOO local prediction variance at the input feature, and adjusts the interval width (for a given coverage probability) using the model’s average LOO error residuals.
Inference procedures over graphs are mainly developed under the context of probabilistic graphical models, with the classic inference techniques such as belief propagation ( Pearl (1988)), generalized belief propagation (Yedidia et al., (2001)), and tree-reweighted message passing ( Wainwright et al., (2003)).
 We first harvest hard-negative examples using distant supervision.
 The assumption is that in many practical settings, the membership of a query in the set S can be figured out from observable features of x and such information is captured by the classifier assigned score s(x).
As a potential solution to improve the privacy-utility bottleneck in differentially private neural networks, we propose the Differentially Private Lottery Ticket Mechanism (DPLTM).
 The primary contributions of this paper are summarized below:
 That is exactly our idea: we suggest that the student (generator) gains benefit from the second master (attention embedded discriminator).
 There is evidence that SAEs can help with domain adaptation (Volpi et al., 2018) or making the control loop more robust (Dreossi et al., 2018b), further motivating our approach.
This paper brings the following contributions.
 Thus, the DDR scores can be assessed for each element after the training of the base network.
 The fusion mimics the Gaussian mixture.
 In order to take advantage of variance reduction caused by small Cπ while removing the risk of increased variance by large Cπ , we further combine existing Monte-Carlo estimator withthe proposed estimator by decomposing the reward into two estimators and learning the optimal decomposition by minimizing the corresponding estimation variance.
 However, disequilibrium among channels caused by the inhibited channels would do harm to generalization ability of the network and simply removing the inhibited channels that are inactive during training does not help improve learning capacity.
The main contribution of our paper is a new way to perform efficient approximate inference in this class of SNLDS models.
 The evaluation on the constructed peer sample encodes implicitly the information about the noises as well as the underlying true labels, which helps us offset the effects of label noises.
 This allows us to update the learned test functions in a computationally efficient manner1Available at https://github.
 The following three contributions render our model to identify the predictive clusters.
 For instance, the Transformer Base model (Vaswani et al., 2017) uses 37% of the parameters in the first and third components using a vocabulary size of 50k, and with parameter-tying between the components.
 To the best of our knowledge, no work yet tackles the question of the existence of a ‘best’ topology for sparse neural network training.
 We first rearrange the vertices via an approximate minimum degree (AMD) ordering algorithm (Amestoy et al., 1996), and then observe a nice arrow pattern in the adjacency matrices.
 Due to the normalization of the second order moment, some coordinates will have very large effective learning rates.
 Our contribution can be summarized as follows.
 Furthermore, the action of cropping restricts the presence of background objects in the search image.
 It is unclear why inherited weights for a specific architecture are still effective.
 A high score implies a higher contribution.
 Read and write operations are similarly distributed.
 To address this issue, CSC is proposed to serve sparse prior as a global prior (Zeiler et al., 2010; Papyan et al., 2017b; 2018) and it furnishes a way to fill the local-global gap by working directly on the entire image by convolution operation.
 Therefore, we can leverage non-robust features instead for robust learning.
 Random search and grid search are typical methods to find plausible λ, but they are time-consuming to find the optimal hyper-parameter because they sample the hyper-parameter in a brute-force way.
 To reduce the possible quantization noise and local convergence problem, we make use of the closest two integer bits to the cursor to quantize the weights for each layer in a DNN model.
 Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-art methods by large margins in both white-box and black-box attacks.
We claim the following contributions:
Overall, the key contributions of this work are as follows:
 Although intuitive to use, these metrics require pretrained models that cover the same target concepts in the same format as the conditioning (i.g,, classifiers for image-level class conditioning, semantic segmentation for mask conditioning, etc.), which may or may not be available off-the-shelf.
 It can be applied to any network structure during testing.
 As these modifications are specific to the PBL problem, we refer to our algorithm as PhysicsNAS.
 Our contributions are are as follows:
In this context, we first argue that the definition of ErrPs is generalizable across different environments.
 Then we cluster the nodes using K-Medoids clustering; K-Medoids is similar to the conventional K-Means, but constrains the centers to be real nodes in the graph.
 The goal of the original supervised learning task is to approximate the ideal mapping f∗ between inputs x and outputs y.
 This learning algorithm improves the generalization capability by obtaining a sparse solution and determines the number of components automatically by removing redundant components.
 Moreover, we also discover some sharp surge and drop patterns in the unsmooth region.
 In order to ensure that the attention capturing Granger causality, we first design an attention mechanism based on Granger causal attribution of the target series and then perform prototype learning that generates both shared and specific prototypes to improve the model’s robust-ness.
We also introduce a simple extension called the Set-HBAE where each data point is a collection of examples (e.g, set of images).
 Images that exhibit the factor can then be generated implicitly as a result of an MCMC process that minimizes the energy.
 This is a greater issue for the case where outliers occur in clusters as opposed to uniform noise, as shown in Figure 1.
 First, the proposed method selects keywords that play an essential role in inferring the answer to the question.
Given the challenge of the task and previous findings, in this paper, we provide several theoretical and empirical results towards better adversarially robust generalization.
 Traditional approaches that construct pairs or triplets over all examples before training suffer from prohibitive O(N2) or O(N3) sample complexity, where N is the total number of examples.
In this work, we propose Variational Selective Autoencoder (VSAE) for multimodal data generation and imputation.
 Relaxing the accuracy requirements increases bandwidth savings to 60%.
 In this work, we propose a novel convolutional tensor decomposition, which allows for compact higher-order ConvLSTM.
 During the pruning era, with fine granularity of at most a kernel size, we exploit one of the three proposed sparsity regimes.
 Analogously, existing GCNs using graph convolution-pooling stacks likely suffer from the same problems, leading to inefficiency both in computation and in memory requirements that severely limit deeper graph CNN architectures and consequently their applications to large scale data sets such as dense point clouds or extensive relational databases.
 To learn both discriminative and domain invariant features, we fine-tune the network to minimize the cross-entropy loss on the labeled source data and domain discrepancy losses.
The analyses and results will give us insight into the geometry of level sets of the loss surfaces of deep networks that are often hard to study theoretically.
 Let fSn be a function by a deep neural network which takes p-dimensional inputs and invariant to any permutations of n coordinates.
 Both zk and z are multi-dimensional tensors.
 Our framework re-derives the method of Cohen et al., (2019) as a special case, and is applicable to more general families of non-Gaussian smoothing distributions and more types of attacks beyond `2 norm.
 Second, while k-NN does introduce the hyperparameter k, we will show that deep k-NN filtering is stable to the choice of k: such robustness to hyperparameters is highly desirable as optimal tuning for this problem is often not available in practice (i.g, when no clean validation set is available).
 The framework presented is flexible enough to allow for user-supplied accuracy and fairness measures.
 The model parameters w are expressed using a number of auxiliary variables ak (Figure 1 left) for k = 1, .
 The attention mechanism also advances our model by considering node information for aggregation.
 Theoretical explanation for why guided back-propagation and deconvolutional methods perform image recovery is provided by Nie et al., (2018).
In fact, human priors have been extensively used in handcraft designed robust visual features like SIFT (Lowe, 2004).
Our main contributions are as follows.
 Random mapping is a highly efficient yet theoretical proven approach to obtain such approximately preserved distances.
 Our main idea is to combine Bayesian optimization, which finds solution closer to global optimum but suffers from high computation cost, with iterative local updates, which converges fast but often get stuck in local minimum.
 Thus, when learning with noisy labels, while the validation loss will first increase and then significantly decrease, the training loss will continuously get smaller with more training epochs.
Unlike post-classification methods, this work considers the problem of improving model accuracy on scene images by exploiting knowledge of neighboring scenes as part of the model training process.
A natural question arises: How does an attacker identify the key steps to attack? As an initial attempt to address this question, Lin et al., (2017) formulate the problem from an optimization perspective,and propose a heuristic that attacks the agent when it strongly prefers one action.
 Since optimization with respect to the distribution of random features is infinite dimensional, we consider a Monte Carlo approximation to obtain a more tractable finite dimensional optimization problem with respect to the samples of the distribution.
 We demonstrate that our decision states generalise to novel environments and tasks, leading to comparable (or better) exploration and performance on downstream tasks compared to Goyal et al., (2019) that identifies goal-driven decision states.
 The ideal1Related work section is in the appendix due to space constraints.
 Secondly, to prevent the discriminator from inferring whether it is evaluating the expert behavior or imitator behavior purely through the dynamics, we propose using a Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) to learn a dynamics-invariant discriminator.
 Both are then combined in a mutual recursive definition of the Q-function for the final algorithm.
 For our goal of training this generator for the dynamic function, we propose an algorithm to optimize the KL divergence between the implicit distribution (represented by draws from the generator) and the true posterior of the dynamic model (given the agent’s experience) via the amortized Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) (Liu & Wang, 2016; Feng et al., 2017).
 Because of this, many recent works focus on improving either one or the other (Madry et al., 2017; Geirhos et al., 2018a).
 We also consider replacing the aforementioned normalization scheme with inverting gradients (IG)Hausknecht & Stone (2015).
 Indeed, using only 10% of the dataset or removing entirely the labels still leads to effective winning tickets.
 However, it is known that in many cases VAEs are only able to generate blurry images due to the imprecise variational inference.
 We apply our technique to several networks and tasks to show generality.
 Experiments show that UNITER achieves new state of the art with significant performance boost across all six downstream tasks.
 Another limitation of SG-HT is that it requires that the restricted condition number κs̃ should not be larger than 4/3, which makes SG-HT hard for solving high-dimensional representation learning problems.
 We call this overall objective, Curious Representation Learning (CRL).
Meta Learning optimizes the performance after adaptation given few-shot adaptation examples on heterogeneous tasks, and has increasing applications in the context of Supervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning.
 These works and other related ones are reviewed in more detail in Appendix B.
 Furthermore, considering the generated texts’ quality and diversity simultaneously (Shi et al., 2018),1An exception is RelGAN which needs not pre-train D.
 b) Predicates of existing datasets follow an extreme long-tail distribution (92.26% predicates with the number of instances lower than 10 in Visual Genome (Krishna et al., 2017)).
Here we develop a new method to parameterize and generate valid Euclidean distance matrices without placing coordinates directly, hereby taking away a lot of the ambiguity.
This work includes the following key contributions:
 The imputation process plays several roles in our global architecture as it provides us with information about the missing data for the target domain while contributing to the domain-invariant loss and the reconstruction loss.
In this work, we propose PrecisE Collaborative hAlluciNator (PECAN), which integrates these requirements into a general meta-learning with hallucination framework, as shown in Figure 1.
 Unlike full generative models making implicit manifold assumptions, the supervised statistical constraints of SDIM serve as explicit enforcement of manifold assumption: data representations (low-dimensional) are trained to form clusters corresponding to their class labels.
 Specifically, they are mostly based on emulating greedy iterative heuristics (Bello et al., 2016; Khalil et al., 2017) and become too slow for training on large graphs.
Our contributions.
 (1)Equation 1 thus gives an equivalent objective for an unsupervised RL algorithm: the agent should set diverse goals, maximizingH(G), and learn how to reach them, minimizingH(G | S).
 On real datasets, we similarly observe that data augmentation can be more detrimental with a smaller original training set (Section 5).
 In Section 5, we discuss the different training algorithms used for training the NN-based agents.
 However, since these methods directly reduce the width (i.g,, dimensionality) in each layer, the principal components are not taken into account.
 This simple observation suggests that when class semantics are consistent, few-shot learning algorithms might not actually need labels during metaevaluation.
 This is again a significant departure from standard models where (a) without explicit regularization at visualization time, feature visualization often produces unintelligible results; and (b) even with regularization, visualized features in the representation layer are scarcely humanrecognizeable Olah et al., (2017).
 We show how VAENAS module can be embedded in both approaches and make performance improvement consistently.
 In particular, the algorithmic stability of a one-layer GNN depends on the largest absolute eigenvalue of the graph convolution filter (Section 4).
 Moreover, existing current meta-RL methods perform badly in sparse reward settings, which are quite common in real world.
We address these issues of partial models by combining general principles of causal reasoning, probabilistic modeling and deep learning.
 An ideal model for continual learning should consider a better trade-off between optimizing performance of the current task and backward transfer to previously solved tasks.
 The translation invariance property implicitly assumed in data augmentation is exactly equivalent to an imposed symmetry constraint in the computation of the CNTK which in turn is derived from the pooling layer in the CNN.
 The second way is trying to clarify the relationship among these objectives using the prior knowledge of experts (see Figure 1(b)).
 Instead, by revisiting our choices, we can reduce the information loss induced by clipping, limit the impact of added noise, and improve the utility of each gradient step when learning with privacy.
 Compared to DSG, SWAT is a straightforward technique which uses less expensive Top-K operation, inspired by meProp, while achieving better accuracy than DSG on ImageNet.
 However, only mean-matching is sometimes not enough to learn the whole distribution especially for those boundary cases.
 We provide theoretical justification for the advantage of a balanced local trajectory improvement and show that MCTS can serve as a policy improvement operator under certain conditions1.
 Figure 1 shows the differences between conventional quantization and HWR.
 However, the connection of causal learning to privacy is yet unexplored.
 We call the proposed model as Attentive Sequential Neural Processes (ASNP).
 Due to the latency and limited bandwidth of network, communication cost has become the bottleneck of traditional DSGD or distributed MSGD (DMSGD).
 It was introduced by Gardner & Derrida (1989) and has played a major role in theoretical studies of the generalisation ability of neural networks from an average-case perspective, particularly within the framework of statistical mechanics (Seung et al., 1992; Watkin et al., 1993; Engel & Van den Broeck, 2001; Zdeborova\\u0301 & Krzakala, 2016; Advani & Saxe, 2017; Aubin et al., 2018; Barbier et al., 2019; Goldt et al., 2019; Yoshida et al., 2019), and also in recent statistical learning theory works, e.g, (Ge et al., 2017; Li & Y., 2017; Mei & Montanari, 2019; Arora et al., 2019).
 This is not surprising, since consecutive gradients in a language model are not independent.
 Complementary to this body of work, we focus this study on the investigation of neural joint models with the bandwidthlimited channel.
 (c) We wanted interpretable failure modes.
 This enables us to deal with reachability on a graph, which is beyond the reach ofstandard SL.
 Moreover, the synthetic likelihood ratio term is unstable during training – as it is the ratio of outputs of a classifier, any instability in the output of the classifier is magnified.
Our approach.
Our main contributions are as follows.
 Our method improves upon the LASSO formulation in two aspects: a) it captures nonlinear interactions between the features via neural network modeling and b) it employs an `0-like regularization using gates whose weights are parametrized by a smooth variant of a Bernoulli distribution.
 The anchor embeddings and the sparse transformation are trained end-to-end for task specific learning.
These empirical observations raise an important question: Why do ensembles trained with just random initialization work so well in practice? One possible hypothesis is that ensembles tend to sample from different modes1 in function space, whereas variational Bayesian methods (which minimize DKL(q(θ)|p(θ|{xn, yn}Nn=1)) might fail to explore multiple modes even though they are effective at capturing uncertainty within a single mode.
 We build our method upon standard actor-critic DRL algorithms and use true model gradients in order to improve the efficacy of learned critic models.
 Our method is the first modelfree off-policy algorithm to successfully train simultaneously both the latent state representation and policy in a stable and sample-efficient manner.
 A loss formulation is devised to enable this approximation under certain conditions.
 This compares favorably with recent literature on optimization and generalization of neural networks Jacot et al., (2018); Arora et al., (2019); Du et al., (2018b); Allen-Zhu et al., (2018b); Cao & Gu (2019); Ma et al., (2019); Allen-Zhu et al., (2018a); Brutzkus et al., (2017) where guarantees only hold for very wide networks with the width of the network growing inversely proportional to the class margins or related notions.
Given the model, we then optimize the design by employing mirror descent (Beck & Teboulle, 2003; Nemirovsky & Yudin, 1983), which allows optimizing the design while adhering to the fixed budget of the principal.
 It requires strong annotations that are accurate up to the boundaries of the objects.
 For instance, (Jain et al., 2019) applied extreme multi-label learning to recommend the subset of relevant Bing queries that could be asked by a user instead of the original query.
In summary, this paper
 Batch normalization also performs well on both the training loss and the test accuracy with small batch sizes and small learning rates.
Nonetheless, although more general, these models still assume that the process is time independent.
 While it may as well turn out to be true, it is useful to investigate how far we could push generative approaches for pre-training even on domains they are not well suited for, such as images.
 Further, we design two new datasets for pixel-level OOD detection with test images that contain both pixels that are in distribution and pixels that are out of distribution, evaluated with two different network architectures—PSPNet (Zhao et al., 2016) and DeeplabV3+ (Chen et al., 2018).
 (4) Many intelligent systems, such as IoTs, require real-time detection and reaction of abnormal events to avoid costly and irrevocable damages.
 We call our method Skew-Explore, since similar to Skew-Fit introduced by Pong et al., (2019), it skews the distribution of the references toward the less visited states, but instead of directly reaching the goals, it explores the surrounding areas of them.
 Examples of this approach are LISTA (Gregor & LeCun, 2010) and its variants, including ADMM-Net (Sun et al., 2016), AMP (Borgerding et al., 2017), and an unfolded version of the iterative hard thresholding algorithm (Xin et al., 2016).
 Freeform filters are not constrained by our composition.
 It has also been argued that the two individual approaches have similar performance, while active learning has lower cost (Gal et al., 2017).
 Then, the test set will be divided into a set of buckets by different attributes of test entities.
 Therefore, in this work, we consider both OD trips and social equity to expand city metro network.
 However, it is known that the training task for GAN is hard, and the convergence property of GAN is fragile (Salimans et al., (2016)).
 Storing just the embeddings but not the pixels could potentially be more space-efficient.
 To achieve such embedding, we propose Modality-invariant and Classseparable Multimodal AutoEncoder (MCMAE), which is an extension of variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014).
 It allows hardware-software designers to quantify the impact of quantization, enabling more efficient systems to be discovered.
 PCRs combine progressive compression and careful data placement to enable applications to dynamically choose the fidelity of the dataset they consume, reducing data bandwidth.
and implicit.
Towards this end, this paper proposes a new class of DNN architecture that integrates features extracted via unsupervised neuro-inspired learning and supervised training.
 Variations of this theme were encountered by Zhang et al., (2016), where they show that networks are able to fit random labels perfectly, yet understandably fail to generalize to the test set of the correct label distribution.
We provide experiments on synthetic data as well as real-world data showing that the proposed method can adapt the sharing pattern to the task relatedness, outperforming strong baselines and previous state-of-the-art methods.
 A pixel is illustrated by a dot.
 The novel contributions of our work include:
 The difference is that the model initialization delivered by OC-MAML is particularly suited for adaptation to OCC tasks and hence requires few examples from only one class of the target task for good adaptation.
Our main contributions are as follows:
 Different node blocks are intended to capture different aspects of the world’s state at step i.
 Reducing communication costs in data-parallel SGD is an important problem.
 Moreover, there was some preliminary evidence that suggested the situation might be more nuanced than the qualitative link between the NNGP spectrum and trainability might suggest.
 These environments are defined by the occurrence of any element in a subset of attributes where each subset, limited to a certain size, is selected uniformly from the power set of all attributes.
 Finally, we show that the model can also be used in situations where a strict orthogonal parameterization struggles (Vorontsov et al., 2017), like the TIMIT benchmark (Garofolo et al., 1993).
 In fact, most practical coarsening methods to date are built on mathematical heuristics; how they affect the structure and properties of the graph is less understood (Loukas & Vandergheynst, 2018).
 However, they either add local attention constraints (Child et al., 2019) which break long term dependency or hurt the time efficiency (Martins & Astudillo, 2016).
 For example, there is a current surge in research around low-memory networks, training sparse networks, and network pruning.
 In this way, we make them potentially easier to search, recommended to more interested audience, and so on, as these procedures are mostly executed by machines based on their understanding of the images.
 For example, Newson et al., (2014) propose a simple but effective method for occlusions in natural videos that replaces occluded parts with information from their neighborhood.
 Hydra instead learns to distill the individual predictions of each ensemble member into separate light-weight head models while amortizing the computation through a shared heavy-weight body network.
 Through this principled approach, we demonstrate that our proposed model can control the quality-diversity trade-off, that is, the degree to which the model depends on forward and reverse KL divergences respectively through a single hyper-parameter.
 Consider a situation of an agent with limited memory and computational resources, being dropped into a complex and diverse environment.
 To demonstrate the applicability of SemanticAdv beyond face domain, we further extend SemanticAdv to generate adversarial street-view images.
 One advantage of multilingual KERMIT is during inference, we can generate translation for a single target language, or generate translations for k− 1 languages in parallel in logarithmic time in the token length per language.
 We use the Graph Filter Discriminant Score (GFD) as a an extra loss term to guide the network to learn a good data-specific filter, which is a linear combination of a set of base filters.
A real-world setting where incentives for SIDS could be problematic is content recommendation: algorithmically selecting which media or products to display to the users of a service.
 In real-world applications, there also exists sample interaction.
 As a result, in this paper we introduce a flow-based intrinsic curiosity module, called FICM, for evaluating the novelty of observations.
 With this in mind, we propose our Weakly-Supervised Moment Alignment Network (wMAN).
 Interestingly, we find that linear classification accuracy is not always predictive of low-data classification accuracy, emphasizing the importance of this metric as a stand-alone benchmark for unsupervised learning.
 We propose a new DNN framework, the VIMPNN (Valence Interaction Message Passing Neural Network), that considers the different interatomic interactions driven by different valences.
 The data efficiency of our framework is evaluated on three datasets, including MNIST and CIFAR-10 for image classification tasks, as well as a medical image set IVUS for biophysical simulation task.
 Furthermore, it should be able be embedded into RL framework to guide the agent how to safely interact with environment.
Our major contributions are:
 The description typically corresponds to verbal commands given by the current user.
 Thus, there is an urgent need for the study of a learnable approach to utilize the structure behind sparse signals.
 More importantly, it can only be used for transductive setting, which means this method cannot consider new nodes during the testing.
 Then a linear classifier is found by SVM, and its hyperplane is translated until the data sizes on both sides are equal.
 This abstraction is then propagated through the audio processing stage (shown in green boxes).
 We speed up the inference by approximating the distribution using histogram and calculating the gradient for this MC estimator.
Related to observation 3, we prove that there are at least polynomially many more saddles than the global minima due to weight-space symmetries in neural networks, without any further assumptions.
 The front part and the back part of the selected layers of student and teacher networks are called student sub-network and teacher sub-network respectively.
apple NN==⇒ apples, pear, fruit, berry, pears, strawberry Motivation (1) Knowledge transfer using pretrained word and topic embeddings: Essentially, the application of TM aims to discover hidden thematic structures (i.g,, topics) in text collection; however, it is challenging in data sparsity settings, e.
 We specifically focus our study on policy optimization methods, which are becoming increasingly popular and have achieved top performance on various tasks.
 We explore two different scenarios.
 In this point of views, we try to handle the shortcomings.
 By maximizing the multual information with compensation, both primitive skills and transitional skills are discovered, which can be used to effectively learn downstream tasks.
Programming Puzzles As a better standard for evaluating and advancing artificial reasoning, we propose Programming Puzzles.
 The contributions of this paper can be summarized as:
 In fact, the difficulty of applying regularization to generate weight sparsity coincides with the observation in (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2018) on the imcompatibility of conventional weight decay (`2 regularization) for training super-deep DNNs as BERT.
 Further, ROOTS learns to model a background representation separately for the non-object part of the scene.
locations across public clouds, private clusters and even edge devices, it is impossible to setup a lowlatency network under long-distance connections and thereby hurts the scalability of training.
 In contrast, the original GAN has the intriguing property of not requiring any explicit choice of distance on sample space.
 Some studies try to visualize the training behavior of one layer by plotting the mean and variance of features (Santurkar et al., 2018).
An accurate forward dynamics predictor that is able to predict a distribution of future states can be of great importance for robotic control.
 Likewise, a relation between two feature attributes should reflect some kind of similarity between them.
 Moreover, they require a generative model that approximates the data distribution, which may not be available in certain domains.
 During training a discriminator network is trained against the generator in an adversarial fashion.
The general intuition behind our approach is that if the posterior distribution of each and every point is pulled towards the prior then it is rather natural to expect that the system will map outof-distribution samples close to the prior, as well.
 These methods give superior performance as compared to the sparse representations encoding methods (detailed before) but may not be explicitly targeting the cause of catastrophic forgetting.
 Fitness of each genotype depends, to some small degree, on the animal’s success over its lifetime in the specific classification task.
 From a purely scientific perspective, once disentanglement is achieved, one can better control for confounding factors and analyze the knowledge the model acquires, e.g, attributing the predictions of the model to one factor of variation while controlling for the other.
 For example, the popular Fourier analysis is usually done in the one-dimensional setting, and thus lacks generality.
 To address the gap between the asymptotic benefit of SVRG and the practical computational budget of training deep learning models, we provide a non-asymptotic study on the SVRG algorithms under a noisy least squares regression model.
 Next, select zc∗ for some 1 ≤ c∗ ≤ exp{K}.
 See Section 5 for a further discussion of the caveats of using rugosity alone as a rule for learning predictors.
 All the above methods perform exploration mainly based on the novelty of states without considering the quality of states.
 This directly incentivizes a policy to overfit to the actions seen during training, just like the problem of overfitting to training data in supervised learning.
BSL builds upon mainly two lines of similar works on boosting without cleanly labelled data:
 The TV content is irrelevant to the task, but the latent representation may learn features designed to predict the state of the TV.
 We find that: 1) both word and sentence level attacks can achieve high attack success rate, while the sentence level manipulation can consider the global grammatical constraints and generate high quality adversarial sentences.
A naive implementation of the above strategies can lead to inefficient exploration and exploitation on complex environments.
 However, the structural precision of reconstruction is generally inferior to the VAE framework, because the high-level semantics of objects outweigh low-level structures for such methods (Donahue & Simonyan, 2019).
Another problem is that to transfer task-specific representations between every task pair, the number of transfer functions will grow quadratically as the number of tasks increases, which is unaffordable.
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
 Furthermore, we notice they are also more robust in a learning scenario that has dataset bias with a train/evaluation distribution mismatch, increasing their performance by up to 11%F1.
 Such complete linearization, however, sacrifices stability of parameter update dynamics to explode when gradient vanishes and vice versa.
 As illustrated in Figure 1, AGMC-HTS consists of a generator to synthesize code-specific latent features based on the ICD code descriptions, and a discriminator to decide how realistic the generated features are.
 In this respect, RBM models (Restricted BoltzmannMachines) (22; 6) are particularly appealing at the expense however of computationally-expensive MCMC schemes.
 This raises many open questions, such as: What is the accuracy of a few-shot learning system when more labeled examples become available? After a certain number of labeled examples, will the few-shot learning system have the same accuracy as a simpler training approach such as conventional training via SGD? If so, what is the number of labeled examples beyond which a conventional approach to training deep neural networks outperforms a meta-learning system? We address these questions in 5.4, providing empirical justification for our meta-learning approach for up to 400 densely labeled examples.
Variants of SGD using layerwise adaptive learning rates have been recently proposed to address this problem.
 Therefore, it is essential to incorporate a model with stable training behavior to obtain better estimates from the consensus.
 When question generation is guided by the semantics of an answer, the resulting questions become more relevant and readable.
 (1) involves both node and edge information, which exactly correspond to the diagonal and off-diagonal elements in K, respectively.
 It means that the similarity between two nodes is decided from three aspects: the consistency of node attributes, the consistency of local topological structures, and the between-node path reachability, as shown in fig. 1.
We instantiate our approach with soft Q-learning (Haarnoja et al., 2017) by initializing the agent’s experience replay buffer with expert demonstrations, setting the rewards to a constant r = +1 in the demonstration experiences, and setting rewards to a constant r = 0 in all of the new experiences the agent collects while interacting with the environment.
 In a large number of experiments, we compare the proposed approach with the leading GBDT implementations with tuned hyperparameters and demonstrate that NODE outperforms competitors consistently on most of the datasets.
 However, the conventional triplet loss (Hermans et al., 2017) cannot work with such refined soft labels.
 Labels are used only after pre-training to learn a classifier specific to the labelled data as well as to fine-tune the deepest layers of the CNN, for which self-supervision is not as effective.
 Bias-corrected Q-Learning (Lee et al., 2013) reduces the overestimation bias through a bias correction term.
 Next, we investigate different mechanisms to control the amount of computation in the decoder network, either for the entire sequence or on a per-token basis.
 However, it is extremely costly to manually seek for the optimal trimming threshold, so it is hard to obtain optimal result in DNN pruning by using these regularizers.
 More precisely, using reduced search spaces, we make use of the Kendall Tau τ metric1 to show that the architecture rankings obtained with and without weight sharing are entirely uncorrelated in RNN space (τ = -0.004 over 10 runs); and have little correlation in the CNN space (τ = 0.195 over 10 runs).
 Intuitively, since the DPP inhibits selection of similar samples, if the set of trajectory samples is more diverse, the random subset is more likely to select more samples from the set.
 In current implementations of TensorFlow, the gradient of |x| is simply set to 0 when x = 0.
 LAMOL is also similar to multitask training, but the model itself generates data from previous tasks instead of using real data.
In the expensive coordination problem, there are two critical issues which should be considered: 1) the leader’s long-term decision process where the leader has to consider both the long-term effect of itself and long-term behaviors of the followers when determining his action to incentivise the coordination among followers, which is not considered in (Sabbadin & Viet, 2013; Mguni et al., 2019); and 2) the complex interactions between the leader and followers where the followers will adapt their policies to maximize their own utility given the leader’s policy, which makes the training process unstable and hard, if not unable, to converge in large-scale environment, especially when the leader changes his actions frequently, which is ignored by (Tharakunnel & Bhattacharyya, 2007; Shu & Tian, 2019).
In this paper, we propose a novel graph neural network that exploits advanced structural information.
 However, this distance cannot be calculated at inference directly, since the ground truth label is unknown.
 This decomposition can also reduce the complexity which is originally a cubic time of |L|.
 Specifically, the ARML automatically builds the meta-knowledge graph from meta-training tasks to memorize and organize learned knowledge from historical tasks, where each vertex represents one type of meta-knowledge (e.g, the common contour between birds and aircrafts).
 Second, AdVIL introduces a variational decoder for the MRF, which provides a lower bound of the log partition function.
 Besides, some designs rely on high-precision internal register or ALUs to support high-precision partial results that are generated during computation before the final output of activations or features.
In many complex systems, such as in many types of cancers, measurements can only be obtained at coarse level (bag level), but information at fine level (individual instance level) is of paramount importance.
 APD decomposes the network parameters at each layer of the target network into task-shared and sparse task-specific parameters with small mask vectors.
 We introduce our framework as an expansion of the variational continual learning algorithm (Nguyen et al., 2018), whose variational and sequential Bayesian nature makes it convenient for our modelling and architecture adaptation procedure.
 We also use these learned distributions to analyze layer-wise and model-wise transfer properties, and to monitor how perturbations of the input change feature space representations.
 Our main contributions are as follows:
 Although it is straightforward to perform kernel-wise quantization via DRL, it takes ultra-long time for a DRL agent to find a proper QBN for each weight kernel of a CNN.
To appreciate this particular connection pattern, we first visualize the training process of the popular NAS architectures and their randomly connected variants.
 We apply structured variational inference to optimize the ELBO.
 However, the fundamental difficulty of learning stability associated with the bias-variance trade-off remains (Nachum et al., 2017).
 After the image transform, some clean images show distributions of softmax with modes at an incorrect class, reflecting the deterioration in voting accuracy as observed before.
 However, empirical study (Han et al., 2015) has shown that weights in a layer of DNN follow a bell-shaped and long-tailed distribution instead of a uniform distribution (as shown in the right figure).
 Accordingly, feature components x̂A and x̂B are termed consistent features between A and B.
 This allows us to remove view-dependent effects from the input images, resulting in images that contain view-independent appearance information of the object.
 A natural question is then how adversarial training helps the trained model in achieving adversarial robustness.
 Unlike the existing QA datasets (Zhong et al., 2017; Pasupat & Liang, 2015), where the linguistic reasoning is dominated by paraphrasing, TABFACT requires more linguistic inference or common sense.
 For these algorithmic problems, we demonstrate clear improvements of NUTM over NTM.
 In particular, we propose optimizing over subgoals such that the resulting task subsegments have low expected planning cost.
 In online execution, the model only runs forward propagation, and its performance is constantly monitored for triggering re-training.
 Neighborhood attention operation is a popular way to implement attention mechanism on graphs (Velickovic et al., 2018; Hoshen, 2017) byfocusing on specific interactions with neighbors.
However, most of the previous work only focuses on embedding the mixup mechanism in the training phase, while the induced global linearity of the model predictions is not well exploited in the inference phase.
 In the process, we gain important insights about some well-known disentanglement learning methods namely FactorVAE (Kim & Mnih, 2018), β-VAE (Higgins et al., 2017a), and AAE (Makhzani et al., 2015).
 Intuitively, by inducing high-density feature regions, there would be locally sufficient samples to train robust classifiers and return reliable predictions (Schmidt et al., 2018).
These findings, along with others, suggest that the generalization ability of deep networks is at least in part due to the incremental learning dynamics of gradient descent.
 But the utility of an arrow of time is more general: it serves as a directed measure of reachability.
 Moreover, the salience maps of our models on images tend to align better with human perception.
 Furthermore, zebrafish are relatively cheap to maintain, produce plenty of offspring, and develop rapidly.
(ii) Selection bias in observational datasets implies having fewer instances within each treatment arm at specific regions of the domain.
 Deep covering options successfully finds under-explored regions of the state space and builds options to target those regions.
 The later means that the generated samples are mixtures of multiple modes and look spurious or ambiguous.
 As a toy example of higher-order structure, we consider the reinforcement learning problem in a variant of the BoxWorld environment from (Zambaldi et al., 2019).
Contributions.
Another active area of research that also aims to reduce annotation cost is semi-supervised learning (SSL).
Recall that the formal definition of an adversarial example is conditioned on it being correctly classified∗ (Carlini et al., 2019).
 It guarantees k-anonymity such that, when an adversary tries to recover the original input from the complex-valued features, it would get at least k different inputs (Please see Appendix B for detailed discussion).
(1)Here, ∇̃ represents the stochastic gradient.
learned and hand-crafted features for visual recognition (Olshausen & Field, 1997; Lowe, 2004; Dalal & Triggs, 2005).
 By contrast, collecting a few labels is cheap and fast.
 Consider a bounded open nonempty domain Z ⊆ Rd0 and any architecture (d0, . , dL) with d0 ≥ d1 ≥ · · · ≥ dL−1 ≥ 2, dL = 1.
A recent trend of domain adaptation in the deep learning regime is the progressive neural network (Rusu et al., 2016), which progressively grows the network capacity if a new domain comes.
 Analogously, it would be useful for algorithms to leverage knowledge of the desired goal distribution to develop more targeted curricula.
 Our findings give substance to this assumption, although it does not always hold in later layers.
 The details are in section 5.3.
 This approach relieves the inefficiency in the prior work (Hester et al., 2018; Nair et al., 2018; Rajeswaran et al., 2017) that the randomly-initialized Q functions require a significant amount of time and samples to be warmed up, even though the initial policy already has a non-trivial success rate.
 One broadly used example of such distributional signatures is tf-idf weighting, which explicitly specifies word importance in terms of its frequency in a document collection, and its skewness within a specific document.
 Specifically, we consider the stochastic nonconvex optimization problem, minw∈Rd f(w) := Eξ∼Df(w; ξ), where we overload the notation so that f(w; ξ) represents a stochastic function induced by the randomness ξ while f(w) is the expectation of the stochastic functions.
Having observed these results, we wanted to understand the sensitivity of the attack to the dimensionality of the victim’s observations.
 Instead, we learn a latent dynamical system model that predicts future values of the flow model’s latent state.
The present paper develops a data-adaptive pruning framework for the GST to systematically retain important features.
 Moreover, our method requires no additional data processing, memory or modifications to the BERT model when fine-tuning for downstream tasks.
 This approach involves training neural networks in such a way that the trained parameters can be easily edited afterwards.
 Assembly makes operations like register reads, memory accesses, and branch statements explicit, naturally allowing us to model multiple problems within a single, unified representation.
 Moreover, our NAS framework can be easily extended to a collaborative search (co-searching), i.g,, jointly searching for a complex teacher network and a light-weight student network in a single run, whereas the two models are coupled by feature distillation in order to boost the student’s accuracy.
 The distribution of "unseen" data could be same as or differentNevertheless, if a generator can learn to create unseen data, then a traditional GAN requires numerous training samples of unseen classes for training, leading to a contradiction with the definition of the unseen data.
 Third, the algorithm in (Rafique et al., 2018) with the best attainable complexity only applies to the finite-sum setting, which needs to go through all data at the end of each stage and are not applicable to the pure stochastic setting.
 While Cohen et al., (2019) derived how to analytically compute the certified radius of the randomly smoothed classifier g, they did not show how to maximize that radius to make the classifierg robust.
 We then test our method against a stronger attack, the Reconstructive Attack, specifically designed to attack our detection mechanism by generating adversarial examples with a small reconstruction error.
 Empirically, our best models improve previous state-ofthe-art mean L2 distortion from 3.68 to 5.65 on MNIST dataset, and from 1.1 to 1.5 on CIFAR10 dataset.
In this project, we analyze whether and how the learning speed advantage of the highly compositional languages exists in the context of communication between neural agents playing a game.
 TREMBA contains two stages: (1) train an encoder-decoder that can effectively generate adversarial perturbations for the source network with a low-dimensional embedding space; (2) apply NES (Natural Evolution Strategy) of (Wierstra et al., 2014) to thelow-dimensional embedding space of the pretrained generator to search adversarial examples for the target network.
 Inspired by Wang & Simoncelli (2008) and Ma et al., (2019), instead of trying to prove an image classifier to be correct using a small and fixed test set, MAD starts with a large-scale unlabeled image set, and attempts to falsify a classifier by finding a set of images, whose predictions are in strong disagreement with the rest competing classifiers (see Figure 1).
The infinite-horizon setting is a very different matter.
 Our architecture reaches a high classification performance on ImageNet with only one dictionaryD, because it is applied to scattering coefficients as opposed to raw images.
 The coreset algorithm is applied layer-wise from the bottom to the top of the network.
 At each stage, the proof follows a two-step strategy that: (a) constructs an infinite series of local minima; and (b) constructs a point in the parameter space whose empirical risk is lower than the constructed local minimum in Step (a).
 Related work is summarized in Section 4 and experimental evaluation is presented in Section 5.
 However, worker may push stale gradients that are evaluated on an older version of the model parameters, which may have a negative impact on the overall convergence speed Chenet al., (2016); Cui et al., (2016).
 RFM takes a semantic description of the state of an environment as input, and outputs either an action prediction for each agent or a prediction of the cumulative reward of an episode.
 The proposed LEC outperforms existing robust training methods by efficiently removing noisy examples from training batches.
Our major theoretical result is a tight certified robustness bound for top-k predictions when using randomized smoothing with Gaussian noise.
 The left action yields +0.
Inspired by that, we developed VL-BERT, a pre-trainable generic representation for visual-linguistic tasks, as shown in Figure 1.
 On the other hand, Luo et al., (2016) propose to measure the effective receptive field (ERF), i.g,the partial derivative of the output with respect to the input data, to quantify the exact contribution of each raw pixel to the convolution.
 This prevents measures of knowledge uncertainty, such as mutual information (Malinin & Gales, 2018; Depeweg et al., 2017a), from being estimated.
 Most research works measure the gradient staleness of a worker according to the delay: the number of master updates since the worker began calculating the stochastic gradient g, until g is used to update the master.
 Our work relates to the interpretability of convolutional neural networks, which has been intensively investigated in discriminative architectures (Zeiler & Fergus, 2014; Dosovitskiy & Brox, 2016; Fong & Vedaldi, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017b;a).
 But this does not scale to large problems or provide an inductive bias during learning.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides simultaneously:
 A sparse-matrix reified KB is very compact, can be distributed across multiple GPUs if necessary, and is well-suited to modern GPU architecture.
 Our semantic mapping builds on BL, or basic fuzzy logic (Hájek, 2013), to support general SMT formulas in a continuous logic setting.
Recently, reversible architectures (Dinh et al., (2014); Gomez et al., (2017); Jacobsen et al., (2018)) have attracted attention due to their light memory demand and their information preserving property by design.
Human-annotated datasets usually contain biases (Schwartz et al., 2017; Cai et al., 2017; Bugert et al., 2017; Poliak et al., 2018; Gururangan et al., 2018; Zellers et al., 2019), which are often exploited by neural network models as shortcut solutions to achieve high testing accuracy.
Figure 1 shows an example learned AssembleNet.
It is clear that if learned representations are overly sensitive to irrelevant changes in the input (for example, small changes in the pixels of an image or video, or inaudible frequencies added to an audio signal), models that rely on these representations are naturally susceptible to make incorrect predictions when inputs are changed.
 We propose to adopt a simpler, deterministic version of VAEs that scales better, is simpler to optimize, and, most importantly, still produces a meaningful latent space and equivalently good or better samples than VAEs or stronger alternatives, e.g, Wasserstein Autoencoders (WAEs) (Tolstikhin et al., 2017).
 We propose computation reallocation NAS (CR-NAS) to search the allocation strategy directly on the detection task.
 Furthermore, it is possible to generate states based on an objective function specified by the user.
 Clearly, to fail in keeping these phases well separated could lead to over-optimistic and biased estimates of the true performance of a model, making it hard for other researchers to present competitive results without following the same ambiguous evaluation procedures.
 Additionally, our bounds independent of the number of pixels in the input, or the height and width of the hidden feature maps.
 Our algorithm follows the general framework of Adam, yet keeping a faster decaying step size controlled by time-variant heperparameters to exploit strong convexity.
Given, the super-classes and the super-graph, we train our proposed GNN model for few-shot learning on graphs.
 Specifically, it finds a rewardfunction, under which the expert policy is uniquely optimal.
 Our attack aims to craft an input that triggers any target class with high confidence.
 This part, together with the decoding manager, depends on the knowledge-grounded dialogues, but the parameters are small in size, and estimation of these parameters just requires a few training examples depending on specific domains or tasks.
are combined into a new value representation of the target node by using weighted aggregation.
 In particular, we focus on discrete-time mean-field games with linear state transitions and quadratic cost functions, where the aggregated effect of the population is quantified by the mean-field state.
 A BNN is an extreme case of quantized neural networks where parameters are primarily binary.
 Our proposal is that the critic should be trained to preserve density ratios, namely, the ratio of the true density to the model density.
 This allows us to automatically learn a useful set of property signatures, rather than choosing them manually (Sections 3.2 and 4).
 The 4D residual blocks could be easily integrated into the existing 3D CNNs to perform long-range modeling hierarchically, which is more efficient than TSN.
 On GPU-enabled platforms, our codec can be faster, even without low-level optimization.
 RAdam brings consistent improvement over the vanilla Adam, which verifies the variance issue generally exists on various tasks across different network architectures.
 However, ProtoNet exhibits performance degradation when the k used in training does not match the k used in testing.
 Models from this family can be optimised using the variational auto-encoder (VAE) framework (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014), by maximising a variational lower bound on the model evidence (Jordan et al., 1999).
 In Ghosh et al., (2018), parameter non-uniqueness is used for multi-mode image generation by training several generators with different parameters simultaneously as a multi-agent solution.
 When and why can we achieve certain transformations but not others?This paper seeks to quantify the degree to which we can achieve basic visual transformations by navigating in GAN latent space.
 This is highly inefficient, since each step involves updating the segmentation network and computing the rewards.
 The white-box setting, while not the focus of this work, follows from the works of Biggio et al., (2013) and Goodfellow et al., (2015) who introduced the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), including several methods to produce adversarial examples for various learning tasks and threat perturbation constraints (Carlini and Wagner, 2017; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016; Hayes andDanezis, 2017; Al-Dujaili et al., 2018; Kurakin et al., 2017; Shamir et al., 2019).
 Figure 1 illustrates the differences between various learning paradigms applied to AD on a toy example.
 Our work differs in its exploration of maximizing performance for a fixed number of iterations.
 Similarly to the SVRG in Johnson and Zhang (2013), VRTD has outer and inner loops.
 We can collect these unlikely token candidates either during next-token prediction or from generated sequences, allowing us to train at both the token and sequence levels.
Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
 Crucially, although there are various threat models and degrees of DP one could consider in the meta-learning setting (as we outline in Section 2), we balance the well-documented trade-off between privacy and model utility by formalizing and focusing on a setting that we call task-global DP.
 Specifically, the coarse-grained classification of dogs and chairs may present different difficulties than the fine-grained classification of dog breeds, and current benchmarks do not establish a distinction between the two.
 Although significant developments are advancing the scoring algorithms, the retrieval algorithms remain less studied, and this is the focus of this paper.
 Next, we derive a principled probabilistic inference objective to create plans that incorporate both (1) the model and (2) arbitrary new tasks.
 We use it to derive a multi-goal multi-agent policy gradient for Stage 2.
 Suppressing this bias makes it possible to attain state-of-the-art performance while training over a very limited range of noise levels.
Our contribution are summarized below:
 We show the equivalence between probabilistic propagation in BQNs and tensor contractions (Kolda & Bader, 2009), and introduce a rank-1 CP tensor decomposition (mean-field approximation) that speeds up the forward pass in BQNs.
Experimentally, we study the most common use-case of Batch Normalization, image classification, which is fundamental to most visual problems in machine learning.
There are a number of reasons why confidence sets can be useful.
 We further introduce a differentiable gating function which makes PG applicable to a rich variety of network models.
 Specifically, we introduce an unsupervised objective that provides an inductive bias to perform accurate information extraction from the context (§4.1).
 Afterwards, we demonstrate the effectiveness of HOF on the task of 3D reconstruction from an RGB image using a subset of the ShapeNet dataset (Chang et al., 2015).
 Therefore, the T-NAS learns a meta-architecture (transferable architecture) that is able to adapt to a new task quickly through a few gradient steps, which is more flexible than other NAS methods.
 We demonstrate how these templates provide the structure required to further constrain our action space via our knowledge graph—and make the argument that the combination of these approaches allows us to generate meaningful natural language commands.
 Finally, curvature: in order to learn a latent space that is specifically amenable to LLC algorithms, we expect the (learned) latent dynamics to exhibit low curvature in order to minimize the approximation error of its first-order Taylor expansion employed by LLC algorithms.
 Filters in Filter Summary are 1D segments, as opposed to the conventional representation of filters as 3D arrays.
 An overview of COMPGCN is presented in Figure 1.
 See Section 2 for a formal introduction of the notion of local elasticity.
For convenience, we refer to this as the Coherent Gradients hypothesis.
 PAI is fully procedurally generated and so it is designed to force neural networks to learn abstractions to solve previously unseen associations.
We adopt the concept of fertility proposed by Gu et al., (2018).
Equilibrium.
 Figure 1(a) shows with ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016), instance-level normalization almost double the inference time compared with vanilla BN.
 Between time steps, agents can communicate via a server-agent network.
 In one study (Wamsley et al., (2010)), subjects learned to find an exit to a maze in a virtual 3D environment.
In this paper, we establish the global convergence of both GD and SGD for training deep linear ResNets without any condition on the training data.
 The latent variables naturally lead to a variational Bayesian inference approach, which is different from the frequentist point estimation in the kernel estimator.
 Moreover, our model predicts consistent type assignments by construction because it makes variable-level rather than token-level predictions.
Another problem with applying the conventional cGANs for generating faces from voice arises from the fact that the distinction between different speakers can be quite subtle, which calls for a need for a more effective conditioning method.
 (1) Semi-supervised learning of 3D object detectors (Figure 1): We show that view-contrastive pre-training helps detect objects in 3D, especially in the low-annotations regime.
 They are 1) re-training the parametric linear classifier in a class-balancing manner (i.g,, re-sampling); 2) non-parametric nearest class mean classifier, which classifies the data based on their closest class-specific mean representations from the training set; and 3) normalizing the classifier weights, which adjusts the weight magnitude directly to be more balanced, adding a temperature to modulate the normalization procedure.
In this paper, we propose a framework for incorporating robustness into continuous control RL algorithms.
edu †Work done while at Facebook AI ResearchIllustration of evolution of weight distributions through learning two tasks.
 Note that the worst-case classification risk is an upper bound of the classification risk of the true clean distribution, minimizing the worst-case risk can usually decrease the true risk.
Our contribution:
Feedback alignment algorithms eliminate the weight sharing implausibility of BP by replacing the symmetric weights in the error backpropagation path by random matrices.
The topic of reasoning physical dynamics of discrete objects has been actively studied (SanchezGonzalez et al., 2018; Battaglia et al., 2016; Chang et al., 2016) as the appearance of graph-based neural networks (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Santoro et al., 2017; Gilmer et al., 2017).
 We call the combination of BB-ANS using a hierarchical latent variable model and the above techniques: ‘Hierarchical Latent Lossless∗Equal contribution.
 A highly effective solution is the reparameterization trick (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014), which, however, is applicable to neither discrete variables nor non-differentiable reward functions.
This proposition says that under a smoothness condition on the function, gradient descent with a constant step size 1L approaches stationarity (i.g,, the gradient norm approaches zero).
 Fusing those features with the K features from the source model leads to significant parameter count saving compared with existing transfer learning practices.
 The main contributions of our work are three-fold:
 At test time, only the neural net fpθ, ¨q is used and the auxiliary variables are discarded.
In this paper, we propose a method to find meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models that can be used to control precisely specific continuous factors of variations while the literature has mainly tackled semantic labeled attributes like gender, emotion or object category (Radford et al., 2015; Odena et al., 2016).
 Moreover, Zhai et al., (2019b) has proposed the simple “Matching, Stretching, and Projection” (MSP) algorithm, which is shown to be experimentally efficient and effective, for solving the program in equation 2:MSP: At+1 = PO(n;R)  (AtY ) ◦3Y ∗  = UtV ∗ t , (3)where UtV ∗t are from the singular value decomposition: UtΣtV ∗ t = SVD(AtY ) ◦3Y ∗.
 To that end, we leverage the availability of new fine-resolution motion sensors which track the locations of people at home (Adib et al., 2015; Joshi et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016; Ghourchian et al., 2017; Hsu et al., 2017b).
 If we were able to train in that set, the gradient dynamics would be coupled with the dynamics on f (k) rather than f (1) and thus could be very different.
 In our experiment, we chosen its advanced version as the benchmark.
 In addition, when there is only one occurrence per word, fine-tuned BERT matches the performance of fastText.
) and their location on the device screen, InferUI synthesizes a layout program that when rendered, places the views at that same location.
 At test time, the MSE is reduced by one order of magnitude.
 To directly improve the strength of the random forest only, we may design a method where negative examples are sampled among the data in the same leaf nodes and with different labels from the anchors.
 However, the loss landscape of the pre-trained model and the fine-tuned solution could be much different, so as their optimization strategies and hyperparameters.
Controllable generation entails modeling p(x|a), where a is some desired controllable attribute(s) and x the generated sample.
 RGBD images comprise the color and depth information of each pixel.
 This architecture covers many of the neural layer types of contemporary models, and we focus on a detailed description for how IBP can be leveraged to efficiently verify its behaviour.
 When augmented with adversarial training, JARN can provide additive robustness to models thus attaining competitive results.
 Current approaches to few-shot learning are hard to scale to large datasets.
 We show that it is important to work in representation space, similar to recent works such as Zagoruyko & Komodakis (2016a); Romero et al., (2014).
 As an indicator of the hardness of augmentation policies, the training losses of the target network are used to guide the policy network to generate more aggressive and efficient policies based on REINFORCE algorithm (Williams, 1992).
 First of all, meaningful directions of perturbation may differ from one instance to another, and one task to another.
Machine learning approaches for imposing fairness can be broadly classified into three main categories: pre-processing methods, post-processing methods, and in-processing methods.
 We present a simple method—BlockSwap—to achieve this.
 The results show that our attack methods can generate adversarial examples with higher transferability than state-of-theart gradient-based attacks.
 To this end, we carefully selected a wide range of complexity measures from the literature.
 Unlike simpler networks, they cannot be written as multiple layers of affine transformations or element-wise activation functions.
This theorem suggests that, arguably, PointNet with an addition of a single linear layer is the simplest universal equivariant network, able to learn arbitrary continuous equivariant functions of sets.
 However, the batch size interacts differently with the overall system efficiency on one hand, and with generalization performance on the other hand.
 Zhu et al., (Zhu et al., 2017) also suggested that an adversarial loss could in principle have been used here as well, but they did not note any performance improvement.
 Previously, this property was only known to be satisfied when the leader moves infinitely slower than the follower in gradient descent-ascent (Jin et al., 2019).
We highlight the key contributions of this work as follows.
 The AdaLIN function helps our attention-guided model to flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture.
 We attempt to solve both.
 We hypothesize that such conditioning prevents redundant sampling: it enables modeling the scenario in which multiple candidate samples can be equally good, yet redundant in combination.
 In concurrent work to ours, Addanki et al., (2019) shows generalization to unseen graphs, but they are generated artificially by architecture search for a single learning task and dataset.
 In contrast, the use of quantized models in EMPIR, which entail the use of significantly lower number of bits in storage and compute, ensures that the overhead is modest (less than 25% in our evaluations).
 B-splines are piece-wise polynomials with local support and are classically defined on flat Euclidean spaces Rd.
 This is contrary to the Pires et al., (2019) hypothesis that M-BERT gains its power from shared word-pieces.
 SPACE learns to process foreground objects, which can be captured efficiently by bounding boxes, by using parallel spatial-attention while decomposing the remaining area that includes both morphologically complex objects and background segments by using component mixtures.
X has zero curvature (Euclidean) 32; 12, positive curvature 57 (spherical) or negative curvature 29; 35; 10 (hyperbolic) or mixed curvatures 15.
Contributions
 Our contributions can be summarized as:
 Specifically, we study the robustness of deep RL agents in a more challenging setting where the agent has continuous actions and its training history is not available.
 Like the method in Liu et al., (2018), EMP obtain OPPE also via learning the state stationary distribution correction, so it remains computationally cheap and is scalable in terms of the number of behavior policies.
 This is a substantially different setting than has been addressed in previous work on meta-RL and it requires substantially different techniques for representation and search.
∗indicates joint first authorship, both authors equally contributed to this project.
The idea of using HB or EB for meta-learning is not new: Amit & Meir (2018) derive an objective similar to that of HB using PAC-Bayesian analysis; Grant et al., (2018) show that MAML (Finn et al., 2017) can be understood as a EB method; Ravi & Beatson (2018) consider a HB extension to MAML and compute posteriors via amortized variational inference.
 The objective of the disentanglement task is to learn a representation containing all the information not available in the class label, denoted as content.
We rigorously evaluate our method on three in-silico sequence design tasks that draw on experimental data to construct functions f(x) characteristic of real-world design problems: optimizing binding affinity of DNA sequences of length 8 (search space size 48); optimizing anti-microbial peptide sequences (search space size 2050), and optimizing binary sequences where f(x) is defined by the energy of an Ising model for protein structure (search space size 2050).
 Our main contributions are summarised as follows:
 The task consists of multiple subtasks, where each subtask gives reward when completed (see Figure 1).
 We show that activation values in a hidden space obtained by feeding a reconstructed input to the autoencoder are equivalent to the corresponding reconstruction in that hidden space for the original input.
To this end, this paper conducts a preliminary exploration to establish an Eulerian-Lagrangian fluidic reservoir that accommodates the learning process of point clouds.
StructBERT significantly advances the state-of-the-art results on a variety of NLU tasks, including the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2018), the SNLI dataset (Bowman et al., 2015) and the SQuAD v1.1 question answering task (Rajpurkar et al., 2016).
Contributions.
 As the minimum search unit, the atomic block constitutes a much larger and more fine-grained search space, within which we are able to search for mixed operations (e.g, convolutions with different kernel sizes and their channel numbers).
 However, few of these mutual information estimators scale well with dimension and sample size in machine learning problems (Gao et al., 2015).
 Inspired by Wu et al., (2019b), LSRA introduces convolution in a parallel branch to extract local dependencies so that the attention branch can focus on long-distance context modeling.
 In this paper we derive the representational cost for any function f : Rd → R in any dimension d.
Modeling continual language learning with improved compositional understanding is at the heart of this paper.
 Not like BC and IRL that essentially match state-action pairs between the expert and the imitator, we only match states.
 We start from proposing a pool of superpixel-like sub-parts for each shape.
 cAdv adaptively chooses locations in an image to change their colors, producing adversarial perturbation that is usually fairly substantial, while tAdv utilizes the texture from other images and adjusts the instance’s texture field using style transfer.
 Consistency regularization is widely used in semi-supervised learning to ensure that the classifier output remains unaffected for an unlabeled example even it is augmented in semantic-preserving ways.
 As detailed in Lemma 3.3, approximating continuous functions proceeds by constructing an infinite width network not directly for the target function f , but instead its convolution f ∗Gα with a Gaussian Gα with tiny variance α2.
 The AlphaGo system (Silver et al., 2017) is an example demonstrating the power of such parallel search (attention) beyond human capacity.
 1) against DNN stealing attacks with minimal impact to defender’s accuracy.
In summary, this work makes the following contributions:
 This behaviour has been reproduced, among others, for magazine covers (Dallett et al., 1968), symbols (Henle, 1942) and even familiar faces (e.g, from classmates) (Brooks & Goldstein, 1963).
 One approach was proposed in (Wang et al., 2018; Elthakeb et al., 2018).
 Since it is almost hyperparameter-free, it does not cause extra complications when tuning models.
We use another way of obtaining uncertainties for deep networks, based on fitting random priors (Osband et al., 2018; 2019).
 However their results only applied to two layer ReLU networks and some specific experiments.
In this paper, considering the incentives to steal a novel DL system and applicability of cache sidechannel attacks in modern DL settings, we design a practical attack to steal novel DL systems by leveraging only the cache side-channel leakage.
 In spike-based backpropagation, the backward pass requires the gradients to be integrated over the total number of time steps that increases the computation and memory complexity.
 We also propose two novel latency regularization methods.
 Moreover, our model compares favorably against fine-tuning of network parameters.
 In Figure 1, a simple empirical study of the channel neurons’ activation magnitudes corroborates our intuition: as deeper layers extract higher-level features, more neurons become either specialized or irrelevant to dogs.
 Nevertheless, it is also uncontroversial that there exists much room for further enhancing it.
 See Sections 3.
 However, many of these methods do not provide explicit graph embeddings which many machine learning algorithms operate on.
 In addition, we surprisingly find that skip connections expose more transferable information.
 Experiments and analyses show effectiveness.
 Yet, existing domain generalization approaches aim at recognizing instance from the same category in the training stage.
 A combination of strategies like efficient memory replay for reconsolidation, neurogenesis, and selective synaptic plasticity could lead to superior methods that defeat both catastrophic forgetting and intransigence.
 The key component underpinning the design of our algorithm is the balanced error rate (BER, c.f. Section 2) (Feldman et al., 2015; Menon & Williamson, 2018), over the target variable and protected attributes.
Simulation experiments in Goetschalckx & Ratliff (1990) and Kulturel et al., (1999) demonstrated that under complex stochastic environments, DoS-based strategies outperform other methodologies significantly.
To start answering this question, we propose to focus on logical classifiers—that is, on unary formulas expressible in first order predicate logic (FO): such a formula classifies each node v according to whether the formula holds for v or not.
 Under this model, gradient descent reaches a point in the early phase of training at which it oscillates along the most curved direction of the loss surface.
In contrast, probabilistic models (e.g, the noisy channel model (Shannon, 1948)) define assumptions about data more explicitly and allow us to reason about these assumptions during system design.
 The vast amount of complexity and diversity on Earth evolved due to co-evolution and competition between organisms, directed by natural selection (Dawkins & Krebs, 1979).
 Each cell is represented as a densely-connected directed acyclic graph (DAG) as shown in the bottom section of Figure 1.
 For that, we build two large new pre-training datasets, which we share with the community: a chemistry dataset with 2 million graphs and a biology dataset with 395K graphs.
 The latent model can infer which knowledge others are likely to select and use.
 The meta-training is performed using reinforcement learning, making the proposed approach applicable to the standard BO setting, where we do not assume access to objective function gradients.
 This rule generalizes to several more instances, thereby eliminating the need of per-instance labeling on those.
 It is twice continuously differentiable and solely based on the atom types and coordinates, which are essential properties for performing molecular dynamics simulations.
 For example, we usually impose explicit regularization such as weight decay (Krogh & Hertz, 1992), dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014; Wager et al., 2013), batch-normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015), and mix-up (Zhang et al., 2018; Verma et al., 2018).
Previous theoretical analysis of A-SGD (Liu et al., 2018; Lian et al., 2016; 2015; Dai et al., 2018; Dutta et al., 2018; Arjevani et al., 2018) focused on analyzing the convergence rate, i.g,, the time it takes to reach steady state, and not on the properties of the obtained solution.
 For us, major advantages of invertible architectures over VAEs are the ability to specify volume preservation and directly optimize the likelihood, and freedom from the requirement to specify the dimension of the model’s latent space.
 For instance, sparse networks of comparable quality to their dense counterparts—yet an order of magnitude fewer parameters—may be created via pruning (Han et al., 2016) or by identifying “winning lottery tickets” (Frankle & Carbin, 2019).
 Taking advantage of EB tickets, we propose an efficient DNN training scheme termed EB Train.
 While stochastic sampling of the tangent kernels suggests that theoretical results on tangent kernels of multi-layer networks may apply to some multi-layer networks and basic convolutional architectures, the predictions from theory do not hold for practical networks, and the trend even reverses for ResNet architectures.
 As an example, we show how to use this framework to construct a simple self-supervised objective that maximizes the mutual information between a sentence and n-grams in the sentence (§4).
Secondly, the aggregators lack the ability to capture long-range dependencies in disassortative graphs.
 This does not only bring challenges to algorithm design but also make theoretical analysis much harder.
 Negative diversity ignorance is a result of unfairly downplaying the nuance of sequences’ detailed token-wise structure.
 Developing an effective strategy is thus of significant importance to the success of BaB based NN verification.
 In particular, for classical control tasks, we propose Structured Value-based Planning (SVP).
 The experimental results show that our Bayesian TAML significantly improves the performance over the existing approaches under these realistic scenarios.
 Furthermore, pseudoknots are present in around 40% of the RNAs.
• Splitting activations inside feed-forward layers and processing them in chunks removes the dff factor and saves memory inside feed-forward layers.
 Representation learning shall both guide exploration, and be fed by self-collected data.
 Unimportant activations are replaced almost entirely by noise, removing all information for subsequent network layers.
 These networks can be interpreted as aiming to capture possible part-whole relationships between the corresponding deeper and shallower capsules.
 In this work, we introduce the CONVCNP, a new member of the NP family that accounts for translation equivariance.
 Second, with the scoring function in hand, we use a dynamics model learned from passive data to obtain the actual policy in a model-based manner while IRL needs to re-train an agent that can be as data inefficient as model-free RL.
 The latent space is used by a generative decoder to generate the targeted output, which should be consistent with the input data and prior knowledge.
Hence, this paper presents a novel and more efficient method named stochastically controlled compositional gradient (SCCG) for solving composition problems involving a two-finite-sum structure.
Contributions.
 Two different objects visible in the same input imagecould be at very different places in the environment.
 Thus, we present a variational inference technique that relaxes the rigid Gaussian prior assumption typically placed on VAEs encoder networks (Kingma & Welling, 2014) to capture faithfully such summaries.
 For better analysis, we propose two basic and necessary concepts: emphasis focus and spread with explicit definition in Sec.3.2.
Recently, the deep learning community has become more aware of the importance of data augmentation (Hernández-García & König, 2018b) and new techniques, such as cutout (DeVries & Taylor, 2017a) or augmentation in the feature space (DeVries & Taylor, 2017b), have been proposed.
 We then use harmonic analysis to determine that the bias in the Straight-Through gradient estimates corresponds to the weighted sum of higher-order Taylor coefficients of f(z).
Obviously, sharing vectors sacrifices the randomness of projection vectors, further degrading the accuracy.
 Black-box machine learning models, such as deep neural networks or ensemble models, have much larger representational capacity than locally interpretable models.
 However, evaluating the value of each datum is far more difficult, especially for complex models such as deep neural networks that are trained on large-scale datasets.
 The main contributions of our work are:
 Inspired by this, an intuitive question to ask is, is the anchor scheme the optimal way to guide the search of objects? And further, could we design an accurate object detection framework without anchors or candidate boxes? Without anchors, one may expect a complex method is required to achieve comparable performance.
 Echoing this perspective, we wonder: Can topology itself in neural networks be optimized? What is the suitable route to do this?To answer these questions, we start by understanding the most representative residual connection in terms of topology.
 Kurakin et al., (2016) then find that FGSM with true label predicted suffers from a “label leaking” effect, which can ruin the adversarial training.
 Another challenge specific to audio is the activation discontinuity.
 In this way, on one hand, we lower the dependence of class prototypes on instance predictions which may be inaccurate, and on the other hand, we encourage the instances with greater certainty to contribute more to their corresponding class prototypes.
We propose a new self-supervised reinforcement learning method, Mutual Information-based StateControl (MISC), which is an approach that learns skills to control states of interest without any reward signal.
 The feedback generator provides feedback embeddings to augment the original user embeddings, conditioned on the estimated rewards as well as the fused inputs.
 Since a closed-form expression is generally difficult to obtain or an approximate surrogate is expensive to evaluate (Monte Carlo estimates), we propose instead a closely related objective that is the loss of the expected predictions of the network under D-distributed adversarial noise.
 In particular, they propagate the -`∞ norm bounded input centered at x ∈ Rn, i.g,x− 1n,x + 1n, through every layer in the network at a time.
 Consistent with this hypothesis, localist units did not emerge when the model was trained on letters or words one-at-a-time (Bowers et al., 2014) (see fig.  1 for an example of a non-selective unit).
 Nevertheless, most of the learning methods presented above are merely engaged in a single aspect of either spatial or temporal information.
 Here we show that neural networks of the form given above converge at linear rate when trained with gradient descent and WeightNorm.
 Specifically, given feature input from both sides of a positive pair (v, vp), a neural network is trained to encode the pair into K different embeddings zkv and z k vp through different sampled neighborhoods or different encoding functions.
 Our contributions are summarized as follows:• Generalization.
 This induces bias for the IWAE objective.– IWAE-DREG.
 Moreover, most of previous runtime approaches only evaluate the importance among channels in each single layer independently, without considering the difference in efficiency among layers.
 Therefore, we can use both originally labeled and unlabeled images to retrain the segmentation network model to achieve a better performance in the end.
 However, such convergence guarantee is dependent on the choice of penalty hyperparameters: the convergence can not be guaranteed any more when penalty hyperparameters are small.
As for video generation the loss used by Wang et al., (2018a), Shahar et al., (2011) tend to be computationally expensive while our approach is simpler.
 No previous work in GAN based audio generation has attempted the direct and fast synthesis of 1D raw audio waveform employing the multiple and progressive encoder-decoder architecture.
Summary of contributions
 We also use super-positioning, i.g,, a feature conditioning mechanism based on the input graph embeddings, to effectively orchestrate the optimization dynamics of graphs with drastically different sizes in the same batch.
 Our contributions are:
 The lrDecay enjoys great popularity due to its simplicity and general effectiveness.
 This is because the logits corresponding to the incorrect classes are all zero, and hence no "Dark knowledge" can be extracted.
 Gramacy & Apley (2015) investigate the properties of GP predictive equation and construct a local predictive approximator.
 The proposed method works directly on the graph of correspondences between the image features, which is agnostic to how the correspondences were computed, thus allowing the algorithm to work in a broad class of environments.
 The nonlinearity introduced for modifying skewness may further contribute to improving the network’s capacity in approaching any desired input-output mapping (which is typically highly nonlinear), and thus making network learning more flexible.
 Thus, instead of task loss, we focus on the uncertainty, which can be obtained with probabilistic Bayesian models.
 In particular, we study another variant, the Transformer with Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN) (Klein et al., 2018).
The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
 Indeed, several prior works report unsuccessful results of AII (Xie et al., 2017; Moyer et al., 2018).
 By learning aggregation parameters to maximize the expected return at a target environment instance, we can better adapt the aggregated actions to unseen environmental dynamics of the target instance without knowing source environmental dynamics nor source policy performances.
 A single simulation parameter was varied for these examples, and a visual inspection shows that smoke plume (a) is more similar to the reference.
 The shape of each point presents the dataset used, and the color of each point presents the GNN model used.
 Both decoding and reconstruction stages are trained using a standard cross-entropy loss.
 yk is the m-dimensional observation (measurement) process, h is an m-dimensional vector-valued function, {vk, k = 1, · · · } is an m-dimensional white Gaussian process and vk ∼ N (0, R), where R is the covariance matrix of vk.
 In real scenes, the images may be of great variety, like a wide range of backgrounds, as is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1 illustrates an example of AutoGrow.
 The architectures of these models are fixed during inference time and thus not adaptive to the varying complexity of input instances.
 In summary, in this paper we:
 Specifically, our contributions are five-fold:
 Compared with vanilla AT, our new training scheme leads to better worst-case robustness even if the defender lacks prior knowledge of the strengths of attacks.
 The mixed stochastic gradient is derived from the gradients computed on the data of the current task and an episodic memory which stores a small subset of observed examples from old tasks (Lopez-Paz et al., 2017; Chaudhry et al., 2018b; Riemer et al., 2018).
 Essentially, GREV alters the direction of reference gradient computed on the episodic memory by slightly perturbing the examples.
 • Effective.
 However, none of these frameworks are directly applicable here since both the historical observations and responses to predict are vertex-level variables.
 In our case of network sparsification, however, the overheads at training time is more than rewarded by the reduced memory and computational requirements at evaluation time, thanks to the high degree of sparsification obtained in the final output model.
Formally, since both GEV and GPD can measure the similarity of samples and centroids, they can be directly utilized in k-means, i.g,, GEV k-means and GPD k-means, which are uniformlycalled Extreme Value k-means (EV k-means) algorithm.
 It poses a unique challenge to scale up CNF and its conditioned variants for real-world tasks and data.
 Despite the success of these methods on CNNs, we observe that they are not directly applicable to quantize GAN models to extreme low bits because of their underrepresentation of original values.
 Given that our training process provides a small distance between empirical distributions, a small generalization error indicates that the population distance is also small.
 A hard assignment of words to aspects might lead to ambiguities that are difficult to capture with a binary mask: in the text ”The room was large, clean and close to the beach.
 Nowadays, the amount of text information on the Internet is increasing rapidly.
 It means that if the original generator and discriminator are random, it is difficult to confirm that the generator and discriminator can converge to the ideal conclusion by training with given data.
 Treatments of various types, however, rely on human decisions and to some extent, an exogenous variable to the development of disease.
 These learning rules exploit the fact that in a RL setting the synaptic error derivative can be split into two factors: a reward prediction error which is positive if an action selected by the network is associated with more reward than expected, or, if the prospects of receiving reward increase while it is negative, if the outcome of the selected action is disappointing.
 The policy obtained from the planning is the maximizer of the total future reward on the learned dynamics, and can have an exponential (in the horizon) number of pieces even if the dynamics has only a constant number of pieces.
In this work, we aim to simplify the training of general purpose multi-modal I2I translation networks, while also improving the diversity and expressiveness of different styles in the output domain.
 With TVMAX, sparsity is allied to the ability of selecting compact regions.
With the advent of large scale datasets, training large deep neural networks, even using computationally efficient optimization methods like Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), has become particularly challenging.
The acquisition of large quantities of a high-quality human annotation is a frequent bottleneck in applying DNNs.
Natural question generation (QG) has many useful applications such as improving the question answering task (Chen et al., 2017; 2019a) by providing more training data (Tang et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2017), generating practice exercises and assessments for educational purposes (Heilman & Smith, 2010; Danon & Last, 2017), and helping dialog systems to kick-start and continue a conversation with human users (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016).
Multi-Task Learning (MTL) ambitiously aims to learn multiple tasks jointly instead of learning them separately, leveraging the assumption that the considered tasks have common properties which can be exploited by Machine Learning (ML) models to generalize the learning of each of them.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an appealing path for advancement in Machine Translation (MT), as it allows training systems to optimize non-differentiable score functions, common in MT evaluation, as well as tackling the “exposure bias” (Ranzato et al., 2015) in standard training, namely that the model is not exposed during training to incorrectly generated tokens, and is thus unlikely to recover from generating such tokens at test time.
Graph neural networks have achieved the state-of-the-art results for multiple graph tasks, such as node classification (Veličković et al., 2018; Gao & Ji, 2019b; Gao et al., 2018) and link prediction (Zhang & Chen, 2018; Cai & Ji, 2020).
Without loss of generality, we consider the bijection problem for graph matching: given graph G1 and G2 of equal size n, graph matching seeks to find the one-vs-one node correspondence1:max xx>Kx s.t. Px = 1 (1)where x = vec(X) ∈ {0, 1}n2 which is the column-wise vectorized form of the permutation matrix X that encodes the node-to-node correspondence between two graphs, and K ∈ Rn2×n2 + isthe so-called affinity matrix2, respectively.
Graph, which comprises a set of vertices/nodes together with connected edges, is a formal structural representation of non-regular data.
Many sequential decision-making problems can be tackled by imitation learning: an expert demonstrates near-optimal behavior to an agent, and the agent attempts to replicate that behavior in novel situations (Argall et al., 2009).
The recent rise of deep neural networks (DNN) resulted in a substantial breakthrough for a large number of machine learning tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, reinforcement learning (Goodfellow et al., 2016).
Person re-identification (re-ID) aims at retrieving the same persons’ images from images captured by different cameras.
Modern machine learning systems can match or surpass human-level performance in tasks such as image classification (Deng et al., 2009), but at the cost of collecting large quantities of annotated training data.
Q-learning (Watkins, 1989) is one of the most popular reinforcement learning algorithms.
Data generated by networks of mobile and IoT devices poses unique challenges for training machine learning models.
The size of modern neural sequence models (Gehring et al., 2017; Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2019) can amount to billions of parameters (Radford et al., 2019).
The use of deep neural network (DNN) models has been expanded from handwritten digit recognition (LeCun et al., 1998) to real-world applications, such as large-scale image classification (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014), self driving (Makantasis et al., 2015) and complex control problems (Mnih et al., 2013).
By automating the design of a neural network for the task at hand, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has tremendous potential to impact the practicality of deep learning (Zoph & Le, 2017; Liu et al., 2018b;a; Tan et al., 2018; Baker et al., 2016), and has already obtained state-of-the-art performance on many tasks.
Forecasting future trajectories of vehicles and human has many useful applications in autonomous driving, virtual reality and assistive living.
In this paper, we consider the problem of training neural networks (NN) under constraints and regularization.
The current dominant paradigm for machine learning is to run an algorithm on a given dataset to produce a trained model specifically for a particular purpose; this is isolated learning (Chen & Liu, 2016, p. 150).
Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has been widely used in coordinating cooperative agents to jointly complete certain tasks where the agent is assumed to be selfless (fully cooperative), i.g,, the agent is willing to sacrifice itself to maximize the team reward.
Despite the huge success of deep neural networks, it remains challenging to fully exploit their power on graph-structured data, i.g,, data whose underlying structure is captured by graphs, e.g, social networks, telecommunication networks, biological networks and brain connectomes.
Deep neural networks (DNNs) are being deployed in many important decision-making scenarios (Goodfellow et al., 2016).
Diversity is desired in multiple machine learning and computer vision tasks (e.g, image hashing (Chen et al., 2017; Carreira-Perpinán & Raziperchikolaei, 2016), descriptor learning (Zhang et al., 2017), metric learning (Mishchuk et al., 2017) and video summarization (Sharghi et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2017)), in which sub-sampled points or learned features need to spread out through a specific bounded space.
Time series (TS) forecasting is an important business problem and a fruitful application area for machine learning (ML).
Learning quickly is the key characteristic of human intelligence, which remains a daunting problem in machine intelligence.
Markov random fields (MRFs) find applications in a variety of machine learning areas (Krähenbühl & Koltun, 2011; Salakhutdinov & Larochelle, 2010; Lafferty et al., 2001).
Deep neural networks have shown excellent performance on various computer vision and natural language processing tasks, such as classification (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015; He et al., 2016), object detection (Girshick, 2015; Redmon et al., 2016; He et al., 2017), segmentation (Long et al., 2015; Noh et al., 2015), machine translation (Zhang et al., 2018b), speech recognition (Nassif et al., 2019), etc.
In machine learning, there are two main learning tasks on two ends of scale bar: unsupervised learning and supervised learning.
Continual learning (Thrun, 1995), or lifelong learning, is a learning scenario where a model is incrementally updated over a sequence of tasks, potentially performing knowledge transfer from earlier tasks to later ones.
Continual learning (CL), sometimes called lifelong or incremental learning, refers to an online framework where the knowledge acquired from learning tasks in the past is kept and accumulated so that it can be reused in the present and future.
Most recent adversarial attack literature has focused on empirical demonstrations of how classifiers can be fooled by the addition of quasi-imperceptible noise to the input (Szegedy et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015; Carlini & Wagner, 2017; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016; Madry et al., 2018; Kurakin et al., 2017).
In this paper, we focus on an important class of combinatorial optimization, vehicle routing problems (VRP), which have a wide range of applications in logistics.
Recently, substantial improvements to state-of-the-art benchmarks on a variety of language understanding tasks have been achieved through the use of deep pre-trained language models followed by fine-tuning (Devlin et al., 2019).
Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been the dominant approach (Sandler et al., 2018) to solving a wide variety of problems such as computer vision and recommendation systems, it is challenging to deploy CNNs to mobile devices having only limited hardware resources and tight power budgets, due to their huge essential computing overhead, e.g, an inference of MobileNetV2 (Sandler et al., 2018) involves 6.9M weights and 585M floating point operations.
Various neural network architectures (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015; He et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017) have been devised over the past decades, achieving superhuman performance for a wide range of tasks.
In recent years, substantial progress has been made in deep reinforcement learning for solving various challenging tasks, including the computer Go game (Silver et al., 2016), Atari games (Mnih et al., 2015), StarCraft (Zambaldi et al., 2018; Pang et al., 2018) and the first-person shooting (FPS) games (Lample & Chaplot, 2017; Wu & Tian, 2016; Huang et al., 2019).
One of the major challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) is the high sample complexity (Kakade et al., 2003), which is the number of samples must be collected to conduct successful learning.

 One of the reasons for this widespread adoption is the simplicity of the update.
 Due to the growing storage/computational power of these devices and concerns about data privacy, it is increasingly attractive to keep data and computation locally on the device (Smith et al., 2017).
 For example, the winning entry of the WMT’19 news machine translation task in English-German used an ensemble totaling two billion parameters (Ng et al., 2019).
 However, a modern DNN model like AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) or ResNet (He et al., 2016) often introduces a large number of parameters and computation load, which makes the deployment and real-time processing on embedded and edge devices extremely difficult (Han et al., 2015b;a; Wen et al., 2016).

 Designing these neural networks typically takes substantial efforts from domain experts by trial and error.
 However, in many real-world applications, decision-making problems are partially observable (Aström, 1965), preventing such problems from being solved by standard reinforcement learning algorithms.
 There are different reasons leading to poor sample efficiency of RL (Yu, 2018).
 Intuitively, one aims to learn a function g which maps the data into some, usually lower-dimensional, space where one can solve some (generally a priori unknown) target supervised tasks more efficiently, i.g,with fewer labels.
 Complication arises when the dynamics of the environments entangle with the observation, which is often a high-dimensional projection of the true latent state.

 We focus on solving two-player zero-sum extensive games with imperfect information (TEGI).
 However, there is still lack of mathematical tools to diagnose representations in intermediate layers of a DNN, e.g, discovering flaws in representations or identifying reliable and unreliable features.
 However, highly realistic re-rendering of such objects, e.g, in a virtual environment, is still very challenging.
 One salient feature of deep models is its overparameterization, with the number of parameters several orders of magnitude larger than the training sample size.
 It can benefit many downstream applications like misinformation detection, fake news detection, etc.
 Our focus in this paper is on meta-learning in reinforcement learning (RL), where data efficiency is of paramount importance because gathering new samples often requires costly simulations or interactions with the real world.
 However, in practice RNNs struggle to learn simple procedures as they lack explicit memory (Graves et al., 2014; Mozer & Das, 1993).
 Generalization to unseen objects and scenes requires robots to be trained across diverse environments, meaning that detailed supervision during data collection in not practical to provide.

 The only variable is the rotation of this polygon around the origin, with the number of points, size, and centre of it fixed.
 As grammar induction essentially assumes no supervision from gold-standard syntactic trees, the existing approaches for this task mainly rely on unsupervised objectives, such as language modeling (Shen et al., 2018b; 2019; Kim et al., 2019a;b) and cloze-style word prediction (Drozdov et al., 2019) to train their task-oriented models.
 Particularly, we rely on graph-structured representation to model reasoning by manipulating nodes and edges where semantic entities or relations can be explicitly represented (Battaglia et al., 2018).
 However, counter-intuitive adversarial examples generally exist in different domains, including computer vision (Szegedy et al., 2014), natural language processing (Jin et al., 2019), reinforcement learning (Huang et al., 2017), speech (Carlini & Wagner, 2018) and graph data (Dai et al., 2018).
 Assuming the observation x is generated from latent factors z via p(x|z), the goal of disentanglement learning is to correctly uncover a set of independent factors {zi} that give rise to the observation.
 In the context of learning from a set of training examples, we can observe compositionality as compositional generalization, which we take to mean the ability to systematically generalize to composed test examples of a certain distribution after being exposed to the necessary components during training on a different distribution.
 However, in terms of robustness, the SCE loss is not sufficient to lead to satisfactory performance of the trained models.
 The theoretical reasons for this success are still unclear, as the generalization capabilities of neural networks defy the classic statistical learning theory bounds.
 For example, if one want to cross the street, one should only pay attention to the positions and velocities of the cars, disregarding their color.
 Given a sequence of observations of our familiar surroundings (e.g, as video frames), we possess the innate ability to predict whether the said observations are ordered correctly.
 However, recent studies (Szegedy et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015) have revealed that deep neural network models are strikingly susceptible to adversarial examples, in which small perturbations around the input are sufficient to mislead the predictions of the target model.
 Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were commonly applied to such classification tasks, relying on feature engineering by domain experts.
 A prominent example is precision medicine – i.g,, the customization of health-care tailored to each individual patient – which attempts to identify which medical procedure t ∈ T will benefit a certain patient x the most, in terms of the treatment outcome y ∈ R.
 However, the question of which options an agent should construct, and the related question of what objective function that option construction process should be optimizing, remain open.
 When trained on appropriate datasets, they are able to produce realistic and visual appealing samples.
 These representations form vector spaces, sometimes equipped with additional structure.
 However, learning expressive neural network policies from imitation requires a large number of demonstrations, particularly when learning from high-dimensional inputs such as images.
 For example, Eykholt et al., (Eykholt et al., 2017) and Zhong et al., (Zhong et al., 2018) studied AEs in the form of adversarial stickers on stop signs or the back of front cars against YOLO object detectors (Redmon & Farhadi, 2017), and performed indoor experiments to demonstrate the attack feasibility in the real world.
 However, it is extremely expensive and time-consuming to label extensive data with high-quality annotations.
 Given a DNN classifier hθ with parameter θ and a correctly classified natural example x with class label y (hθ(x) = y), an adversarial example x′ can be generated by perturbing x such that hθ(x′) 6= y, i.g,, the natural example is correctly classified before perturbation but misclassified after perturbation.
 Some of the most successful recent applications of deep RL to difficult environments such as Dota 2 (OpenAI, 2018a), Capture the Flag (Jaderberg et al., 2019), Starcraft II (Vinyals et al., 2019), and dexterous object manipulation (OpenAI, 2018b) have used policy gradient-based methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) and the Importance-Weighted Actor-Learner Architecture (IMPALA) (Espeholt et al., 2018), both in the approximately on-policy setting.
 Although on-device machine learning has exhibited various advantages, it usually burdens thin devices with overwhelming computational overhead.
 These models are typically trained to have near zero training loss, known as interpolation and often have strong generalization performance, as indicated by a range of empirical evidence including (23; 3).
 Self-supervision has recently emerged as one of the most promising approaches to address this limitation.
 More specifically, one often assumes that there is a distribution p(z) over these latent variables and that observations in this ground-truth model are generated by sampling z from p(z) first.
 Multiple aspects of deep learning seem at first sight to contradict common sense: single-hidden-layer networks suffice to approximate any continuous function (Cybenko, 1989; Hornik et al., 1989), yet in practice deeper is better; the loss surface is highly non-convex, yet it can be minimised by first-order methods; the capacity of the model class is immense, yet deep networks tend not to overfit (Zhang et al., 2017).
 Such data are known as out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, and detecting them should facilitate safe and reliable model operation.
 However, RL adoption in real-world problems is limited due to poor sample efficiency and failure to generalise to environments even slightly different from those seen during training.
 In deep learning, there has been significant research effort in establishing expressivity results for feedforward (Cybenko, 1989; Hornik et al., 1989; Lu et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Neto et al., 1997), as well as more recently for Transformers and Neural GPUs (Pérez et al., 2019).
If the data of the target domain are not large enough, using data from the source domain typically helps to improve model performance in the target domain.
 But such correlation-based learning may struggle in dynamic environments with constantly changing settings or goals, because policies that correlate with rewards in one episode may fail to correlate with rewards in a subsequent episode.
 Intuitively, identifiability refers to the ability of a model to learn stable representations.
 With the learnt dynamics, a MBRL agent can for example perform online planning, interact with imaginary data, or optimize the controller through dynamics, which provides significantly better sample efficiency (Deisenroth & Rasmussen, 2011; Sutton, 1990; Levine & Abbeel, 2014; Levine & Koltun, 2013).
 Imitation learning from a small number of demonstrations followed by RL finetuning is a promising paradigm to improve the sample efficiency (Rajeswaran et al., 2017; Večerík et al., 2017; Hester et al., 2018; Nair et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2018).
 Notably, there is no guarantee that value estimation by temporal difference (TD) learning converges when using nonlinear function approximators, even in the on-policy case.
 Specifically, the goal is to enable an algorithm to expand to new classes for which only a few training instances are available.
 It has been widely adopted for training machine learning models in various applications.
 Recent work has shown that deep RL policies are also vulnerable to adversarial perturbations of image observations (Huang et al., 2017; Kos and Song, 2017).
 Progress in the field has translated to improvements in various capabilities, such as classification of images (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), machine translation (Vaswani et al., 2017) and super-human game-playing agents (Mnih et al., 2013; Silver et al., 2017), among others.

 Researchers ascertain that pretraining allows models to learn syntactic and semantic information of language that is then transferred on other tasks (Peters et al., 2018b; Clark et al., 2019).
 However, just like humans, artificial neural networks sometimes make mistakes.
 The end of this exponential scaling has enormous ramifications for computing (Hennessy & Patterson, 2019) since the demand for compute has simultaneously grown exponentially, relying on Moore’s Law to compensate (Ranganathan, 2017).
 Despite its performance breakthrough thanks to the prosperity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Long et al., 2015), as a dense structured prediction task, segmentation models commonly suffer from heavy memory costs and latency, often due to stacking convolutions and aggregating multiple-scale features, as well as the increasing input image resolutions.
 It has been demonstrated that unseen samples can be applied to several applications.
 From an optimization perspective, all of them are solving an empirical risk minimization problem in which the objective function is a surrogate loss of the prediction error made by a deep neural network in comparison with the ground-truth label.
 Given an image x that is correctly classified by a neural network, a malicious attacker may find a small adversarial perturbation δ such that the perturbed image x + δ, though visually indistinguishable from the original image, is assigned to a wrong class with high confidence by the network.
 A series of studies on adversarial attacks have shown that it is easy to cause misclassifications using visually imperceptible changes to an image under `p-norm based similarity metrics (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Kurakin et al., 2016; Madry et al., 2017; Carlini & Wagner, 2017b; Goodfellow et al., 2018).
 Despite their outstanding performance, these networks are shown to be vulnerable against various types of adversarial attacks, including evasion attacks (aka, inference or perturbation attacks) (Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014b; Carlini & Wagner, 2017b; Su et al., 2019) and poisoning attacks (Liu et al., 2017; Shafahi et al., 2018).
 While various kinds of fully observable environments have been well investigated, recently, partially observable (PO) environments (Hafner et al., 2018; Igl et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019; Jaderberg et al., 2019) have commanded greater attention, since real-world applications often need to tackle incomplete information and a non-trivial solution is highly desirable.
 With the success of RL in relatively easy tasks, more challenging tasks such as sparse reward environments (Oh et al., (2018); Zheng et al., (2018); Burda et al., (2019)) are emerging, and developing good RL algorithms for such challenging tasks is of great importance from both theoretical and practical perspectives.
 So far, most of the existing methods focus on building statistical associations between textual inputs and semantic representations, e.g, using first-order logic (Manning et al., 1999) or other types of representations such as abstract meaning representation (Banarescu et al., 2013).
 Methods to attack neural networks can be divided into two categories based on whether the parameters of the neural network are assumed to be known to the attacker: white-box attack and black-box attack.
 In recent years, considerable effort has been put into designing novel network architectures (He et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2018) and advanced optimization algorithms (Kingma & Ba, 2015) to improve the training of image classifiers based on deep neural networks (DNNs), while little attention has been paid to comprehensive and fair evaluation/comparison of their model performance.
 In particular, Devlin et al., (2018) recently demonstrated the effectiveness of finetuning a large-scale language model pretrained on a large, unannotated corpus on a wide range of NLP tasks including question answering and language inference.
 A typical model in RL is Markov Decision Process (MDP).
 Scattering transforms are simplified convolutional neural networks with wavelet filters which are not learned (Bruna & Mallat, 2013).
 Since Krizhevsky et al., (2012) used a model with 60M parameters to win the ImageNet competition in 2012, network architectures have been growing wider and deeper.
 The network comprises a hidden layer and an input layer of widths m and d, respectively; and is to be trained over a training set of size n.
 A majority of novelty detection methods focus on noise filtering or representation learning.
 In spite of this, the theoretical foundations of neural networks are somewhat premature.
 For example, the trajectories of coupled particles are co-determined by perparticle physical properties (e.g, mass and velocity) and their physical interactions (e.g, gravity); traffic flow can be viewed as the coevolution of a large number of vehicle dynamics.
 To be able to train large models, which are both computationally demanding or require very large training datasets, SGD is often parallelized across several machines, with the well-known parameter-server (PS) framework being one of the most widely adopted distribution strategies.
 However, there also exist a lot of challenges in multiagent systems (MASs) since agents’ behaviors are influenced by each other and the environment exhibits more stochasticity and uncertainties (Claus & Boutilier, 1998; Hu & Wellman, 1998; Bu et al., 2008; Hauwere et al., 2016).
 Unlike previous work, the reanimation is controlled by a low-dimensional signal, such as the one provided by a joystick, and the model has to complete this signal to a high-dimensional full-body signal, in order to generate realistic motion sequences.
 For text generation, however, the performance of GANs is severely limited due to reward sparsity and mode collapse: reward sparsity refers to the difficulty for the generator to receive reward signals when its generated samples can hardly fool the discriminator that is much easier to train; while mode collapse refers to the phenomenon that the generator only learns limited patterns from the real data.
 However, it is difficult to obtain highquality labeled datasets in practice (Wang et al., 2018a).
The question of identifiability is closely related to the goal of learning disentangled representations (Bengio et al., 2013).
 Specifically, given an example x and a classifier f , an attacker can carefully craft a perturbation δ such that f makes predictions for x + δ as the attacker desires.
 As environment complexity grows, exploration becomes more challenging and simple randomisation strategies become inefficient.
 Firstly in computer vision, backbone networks designed for and pre-trained on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) classification are found to be effective for improving numerous image recognition tasks.
 Semantics describe the high-level abstraction of what we perceive, and deformation defines the geometric transformation tied to specific data (Gibson, 1950).
 Despite impressive supervised learning performance, NNs tend to make over-confident predictions (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) and, until recently, have been unable to provide measures of uncertainty in their predictions.
 Distributing the computations over several workers can drastically reduce the training time.
 In particular, two kinds of approaches emerged as state-of-the-art (SOTA): Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014), and Variational Autoencoders (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014).
 Current machine learning approaches to physical modeling from video either require training by supervised regression from video to object coordinates before estimating explicit physics (Watters et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2017b; Belbute-Peres et al., 2018), or are able to discover and segment objects from video in an unsupervised manner, but do not naturally integrate with a physics engine for long-term predictions or generation of interpretable locations and physical parameters for physical reasoning (Xu et al., 2019; van Steenkiste et al., 2018).
 A good measure can make a once hard task easy, even trivial.
 For a given task and model architecture, how much data would one require to reach a prescribed performance level? How big a model would be needed?Addressing such questions is made especially difficult by the mounting evidence that large, deep neural networks trained on large-scale data outperform their smaller counterparts, rendering the training of high performance models prohibitively costly.
 We consider here the related but different problem of incorporating a symbolic KB into a neural system, so as to inject knowledge from an existing KB directly into a neural model.
 However, as programs have become increasingly complex, real-world program verification often requires prohibitively expensive manual effort (Wilcox et al., 2015; Gu et al., 2016; Chajed et al., 2019).
 Identifying the optimal architecture is indeed a key pillar of any Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) pipeline.
 Excellent performance has been achieved on a wide range of supervised machine learning tasks, ranging from image classification (He et al., (2016)) and object detection (Ren et al., (2015)) to speech recognition (Amodei et al., (2016)).
 Before assigning 4 stars to a film, a critic would have thought, “It is better than 3-star films but worse than 5-stars.” This ranking through pairwise comparisons is done in various decision processes (Saaty, 1977).
 With success of unsupervised representation learning in NLP, language pre-training based models such as GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) have achieved nearly saturated performance on most of the popular MRC datasets (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Lai et al., 2017; Rajpurkar et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018).
 Because a video contains spatio-temporal data, its representation is required to abstract both appearance and motion information.
 Researchers working in domains like Computer Vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and Natural Language Processing (Devlin et al., 2018) have already demonstrated the effectiveness of representations and features computed by deep architectures for the solution of other tasks.
 By capturing the mechanisms behind the data generation process, one can reason about data probabilistically, access and traverse the lowdimensional manifold the data is assumed to live on, and ultimately generate new data.
 The backbone feature extractor is usually taken directly from classification literature (Girshick, 2015; Ren et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2017a; Lu et al., 2019).
 Artificial agents should be equipped with the same capability, so that their decision making process is interpretable by researchers.
 These issues are not easy to address, as a collective effort is required to avoid bad practices.
 One interesting point that has been explored, with roots in (Bartlett, 1998), is that even if there are many parameters, the set of models that can be represented using weights with small magnitude is limited enough to provide leverage for induction (Neyshabur et al., 2015; Bartlett et al., 2017; Neyshabur et al., 2018).
 It is performed in a sequence of consecutive rounds: In each round t, firstly a learner chooses a decision xt from a convex set D ⊆ Rd, at the same time, an adversary reveals a loss function ft(·) : D 7→ R, and consequently the learner suffers a loss ft(xt).
 The necessity to adapt to non-stationary data is often not reconcilable with the goal of preventing forgetting.
 While there have been a plethora of newer, intricate architectures proposed, in this work we train our sights instead on an older staple of the deep learning toolkit: multiplicative interactions.
 The overarching theme in GNNs is for each node’s feature vector to be generated by passing, transforming, and recursively aggregating feature information from a given k-hop neighborhood surrounding the node.
 These intelligent agents need to accommodate a huge number of tasks with unique environmental demands.
 Because training a deep model is expensive, time-consuming, and data intensive, it is often undesirable or impractical to train a model from scratch in many applications.
 Thanks to the advances in neural sequence modeling (Vaswani et al., 2017; Sutskever et al., 2014) and machine learning techniques (Li et al., 2017; 2016), such systems now are able to reply with plausible responses regarding to conversation history, and thus allow an agent to have a natural conversation with humans.
 Novel view synthesis is the task of generating a new view seen from a different camera position, given a single or multiple input images, and finds many applications in robotics, navigation, virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), cinematography, etc.
 As such, different tree-like structures have been proposed to represent the compositional grammar and meaning of a text, such as constituency and dependency trees.
For a functional cost C, the Hessian of the loss RP 3 θ 7→ C ( F (L) (θ) ) is the sum of two P × P matrices I and S.
 Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) (Shoham et al., 2003; 2007; Busoniu et al., 2008) aims to extend RL to sequential decision-making problems involving multiple agents.
 However, many concerns have been raised about the decision making process behind machine learning technology.
 These methods train a deep neural network, called a generator, to transform samples from a noise distribution to samples from the data distribution.
 Deep learning methods have shown promise at automatically generating programs from a small set of input-output examples (Balog et al., 2016; Devlin et al., 2017; Ellis et al., 2018b; 2019b).
 However, due to practical issues such as memory consumption and computational cost, these models are mainly used for clip-level feature learning instead of learning from the whole video.
 Hierarchical methods lower the decision making burden on the agent through the use of problem specific action abstractions (Konidaris, 2019).
 Point-and-click solutions are readily available for plausible object insertion (Portenier et al., 2019), removal (Xiong et al., 2019), sky replacement (Tsai et al., 2016), face editing (Portenier et al., 2018) and many other popular operations.
 Remarkably, stochastic gradient-based optimization, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), has witnessed tremendous success in many fields of science and engineering despite its simplicity.
 While in principle the reward only needs to specify the goal of the task, in practice RL can be exceptionally time-consuming or even infeasible unless the reward function is shaped so as to provide a smooth gradient towards a successful outcome.
 In comparison, while modern deep learning methods achieve unprecedented performances with very deep neural-networks (He et al., 2016; Szegedy et al., 2015), they require extensive amounts of data to train, often ranging in the millions.
 Leo Tolstoy, Anna KareninaDespite the success of deep learning in the recent years (Hu et al., 2018; Espeholt et al., 2018; Silver et al., 2018; Lample et al., 2018; Hessel et al., 2017; Oord et al., 2016), the majority of state of the art approaches are still missing many basic yet important properties, such as fairness, data efficient learning, strong generalisation beyond the training data distribution, or the ability to transfer knowledge between tasks (Lake et al., 2016; Garnelo et al., 2016; Marcus, 2018).
 For example, the models that predict if a user will click on an online advertisement are often based on function approximators that contain complex components in order to achieve optimal recommendation accuracy.
 However, estimating mutual information from samples is challenging (McAllester & Statos, 2018) and traditional parametric and non-parametric approaches (Nemenman et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2015; 2017) struggle to scale up to modern machine learning problems, such as estimating the MI between images and learned representations.
 While supervised methods can be used to identify pertinent objects, it is intractable to collect labels for every scenario and task.
 Transformer architectures (Vaswani et al., 2017) with hundreds of millions or billions of parameters regularly reestablish state-of-the-art on held-out validation perplexities, however, the generated samples can still often lack coherence.
 The mapping from a condition, e.g, a map, to an image, e.g, a satellite image, is essentially one-to-many as illustrated in Figure 1.
 Unlocking the full promise of such applications requires a system perspective where task performance, throughput, energy-efficiency, and compactness are all critical considerations to be optimized through co-design of algorithms and deployment hardware.
 When introduced in 2014, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) could only synthesize MNIST digits and low-resolution grayscale faces (Goodfellow et al., 2014).
 Convolutional neural networks (Lecun et al., 1998)-based methods have achieved excellent results on large-scale supervised semantic segmentation, in which we assume pixel-level annotations are available (Farabet et al., 2013; Pinheiro & Collobert, 2014; Long et al., 2015).
 Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are malicious inputs designed to fool the model’s prediction—see (Biggio and Roli, 2018) for a comprehensive, recent overview of adversarial examples.
 Typically AD methods attempt to learn a “compact” description of the data in an unsupervised manner assuming that most of the samples are normal (i.g,, not anomalous).
 Improvements have been particularly transformative in computer vision (Huang et al., 2017b; He et al., 2017).
 The high-dimensional dense embeddings generated from DNNs however pose a computational challenge for performing nearest neighbor search in large-scale problems with millions of instances.
 The temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm, originally proposed by Sutton (1988), is one of the most widely used policy evaluation methods, which uses the Bellman equation to iteratively bootstrap the estimation process and continually update the value function in an incremental way.
 Accordingly, many successful demonstrations of RL often rely on carefully handcrafted rewards with various bonuses and penalties designed to encourage intended behavior (Nachum et al., 2019a; Andrychowicz et al., 2018).
 A significant body of work has looked at tackling this challenge using meta-learning approaches (Koch et al., 2015; Vinyals et al., 2016; Snell et al., 2017; Finn et al., 2017; Santoro et al., 2016; Ravi and Larochelle, 2016; Nichol and Schulman, 2018).
 Specifically, in chemistry, the design of tailor-made organic materials and molecules requires efficient methods to explore the chemical space.
 These objectives have been popular long before deep learning was prevalent, and there is a long line of work showing they enjoy strong statistical guarantees for linear and kernel methods (Bartlett and Mendelson, 2002; Koltchinskii et al., 2002; Hofmann et al., 2008; Kakade et al., 2009).
 However, the standard approach – training a sequence to sequence model, e.g, Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), to maximize log-likelihood and approximately decoding the most likely sequence – is known to be flawed.
 Achieving this control however is made difficult by the necessity of acquiring a large quantity of high quality labels.
 One important source of unreliability is extrapolation.
 This insight on the loss landscape geometry provides us with easy access to a large number of similar-performing models on the low-loss path between two given models, and Garipov et al., (2018) use this to devise a new model ensembling method.
 At a high level, the key assumption leveraged by these approaches is that the sharing of knowledge gained from individual learning tasks can help catalyze the learning of similar unseen tasks.
 Improving on this aspect would lead to more efficient algorithms that can flexibly expand their knowledge without requiring large labeled datasets.
 One can view this problem as learning a scoring function f : X × Y → R, that maps a pair of a query and a document (q,d) ∈ X × Y to a score f(q,d).
 At test-time, the model pursues its best-guess of desirable behavior.
 In autonomous driving, multiple vehicles must execute cooperative maneuvers when their individual goal locations and nominal trajectories are in conflict (e.g, double lane merges) (Cao et al., 2013).
 Achieving high-quality denoising results requires (at least implicitly) quantifying and exploiting the differences between signals and noise.
 Given a victim neural network model and a correctly classified example, an adversarial attack aims to compute a small perturbation such that with this perturbation added, the original example will be misclassified.
 However, the complexity of the tensor operations in DNNs and the volatility of algorithms, which has led to unprecedented rate of innovation (LeCun, 2019), calls for developing automated compilation frameworks.
 Consider the class of “contextual” illusions, where the perceived qualities of an image region, such as its orientation or color, are biased by the qualities of surrounding image regions.
 While what is most commonly meant by generalization is being robust to having a limited number of training examples in distributionally-matched settings (Zhang et al., 2016), many tasks are designed to address variations in the data between when a model is trained and when it is evaluated.
 While such autoregressive translation (AT) models have proven successful, the sequential dependence of decisions precludes taking full advantage of parallelism afforded by modern hardware (e.g, GPUs) at inference time.
 Utilizing local training data of participants (i.g,, parties), FL helps train a shared global model with improved performance.
 Models trained this way, called Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) (Wang & Yeung, 2016), in principle have well-calibrated uncertainties when they make predictions, which is important in scenarios such as active learning and reinforcement learning (Gal, 2016).
 A key component of many neural networks is the use of normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015), Group Normalization (Wu & He, 2018), or Layer Normalization (Ba et al., 2016), with Batch Normalization the most commonly used for vision-based tasks.
 The most common choice for the learned optimizer is recurrent neural network (RNN) since it can capture long-term dependencies and propose parameter updates based on knowledge of previous iterations.
 These advances, even more-so than those from supervised learning, rely on significant numbers of training samples, making them impractical without large-scale, distributed parallelization.
We consider the setting where the test data follows the same distribution as the training data (i.g,, we do not consider adversarial examples designed to fool the network (Szegedy et al., 2014)); even in this setting, confidence estimates produced by deep neural networks are notoriously unreliable (Guo et al., 2017).
 One evident trend in DNN design is that as researchers strive for better accuracy, both the model size and the number of DNN layers have drastically increased over time (Xu et al., 2018).
 Recent models have performed well on certain QA datasets, sometimes rivaling humans (Zhang et al., 2019), but it has become increasingly clear that they primarily exploit surface level lexical cues (Jia & Liang, 2017; Feng et al., 2018) and compositional QA still remains a challenge.
 If we consider an object to be a continuous surface in R3, it is not straightforward to directly represent this infinite set of points in memory.
 There exists a wide variety of deep neural network based unidirectional methods that model images (texts) given texts (images) (Gomez et al., 2017; Kiros & Szepesvari, 2012; Reed et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017a).
 Behind their successes, the design of network architecture plays an important role, and the hand-designed networks (e.g, ResNet (He et al., 2016), DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017)) have provided strong baselines in many tasks.
 We are motivated by the question of how learning agents can understand and generate contextually relevant natural language in service of achieving a goal.
 This decomposition confers several notable benefits.
 Theoretical computer science has successfully discovered effective and highly influential algorithms for many of these tasks.
 Albeit the power of CNNs, they are usually over-parameterized and of large parameter space, which makes it difficult for deployment of CNNs on mobile platforms or other platforms with limited storage.
 Traditional neural network architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and Recurrent Neural Networks (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) are constrained to handle only Euclidean data.
 Bayesian networks (BN), which encode conditional independencies using directed acyclic graphs (DAG), are powerful models which are both interpretable and computationally tractable.
 However, neural networks have several intriguing aspects that defy conventional views of statistical learning theory and optimization, thereby hindering the architecture design and interpretation of these models.
 This is typically demonstrated by training a classification network that achieves good test accuracy on a real dataset S, on a modified version of S (call it S\\u2032) where the labels are randomized and observing that the training accuracy on S\\u2032 is very high, though, of course, the test accuracy is no better than chance (Zhang et al., 2017).
 For instance, imagine walking your daughter to a coding summer camp and encountering another little girl with a woman.
 As a sample dialogue shown in Table 1, each user utterance typically contains important information identified as slots related to a dialogue domain such as attraction-area and train-day.
 Subsequently, RNNs output an affine function of the hidden states as its prediction.
 Yet surprisingly, the underlying reasons for the success of these approaches remain poorly understood, despite remarkable empirical performance (Santurkar et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017).
 It has been widely proven effective in many applications, and become the indispensable part of many state of the art deep models.
 In many tasks using bandit algorithms, it is appealing to employ more agents to learn collaboratively and concurrently in order to speed up the learning process.
 This lack of generalization presents two issues when ANNs are utilized in the real world.
 Many key properties of the learning process for such systems are also present in the idealized case of deep linear networks.
 For instance, one example of such bias encoding leading to improved performance is convolution.
 However, acquiring labels is a costly process, which motivates research on methods that can effectively utilize unlabeled data to improve performance.
 This paper focuses on multivariate spatial point processes (SPP), which can uncover hidden connections between subprocesses based on the correlations of their spatial point patterns.
 Gradual typing can address these shortcomings: program variables have optional type annotations so that the type system can perform static type checking whenever possible (Siek & Taha, 2007; Chung et al., 2018).
 For example, some neurological studies have found that in some cortical areas, humans recognize familiar individuals by combining signals from several modalities, such as faces and voices (Hasan et al., 2016).
 These theories currently have extensive empirical support: stimuli are processed more quickly if they are predictable (McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981; Pinto et al., 2015), prediction error is reflected in increased neural activity (Rao & Ballard, 1999; Brodski et al., 2015), and disproven expectations lead to learning (Schultz et al., 1997).
 Such datasets are usually artificially balanced with respect to the number of instances for each object/class in the training set.
 That is, the policy aims to maximize the sum of future expected rewards that an agent accumulates in a particular task.
 Artificial learning systems typically forget prior tasks when they cannot access all training data at once but are presented with task data in sequence.
 For instance, noisy corrupted (wrong) labels may be resulted from annotating for similar objects (Su et al., 2012; Yuan et al., 2019), crawling images and labels from websites (Hu et al., 2017; Tanaka et al., 2018) and creating training sets by program (Ratner et al., 2016; Khetan et al., 2018).
 Applications ranging from fraud detection to mobile phone keyboards use models trained on data that may be privacy sensitive.
 By combining the outputs of several models, an ensemble can achieve better performance than any of its members.
 Since it has been introduced, BP has sparked several discussions on whether physical brains are realizing BP-like learning or not (Grossberg, 1987; Crick, 1989).
 Recently, the neural tangent kernel (NTK) has provided the following insight into the problem.
 While deep learning has achieved remarkable successes in prediction tasks by learning latent representations from data-rich applications such as image recognition (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), text understanding (Wu et al., 2016), and speech recognition (Hinton et al., 2012), we confront many challenging scenarios in modeling natural phenomena with deep neural networks when only a limited number of observations are available.
 In an ideal implementation, the method can achieve an expected message length equal to the variational free energy, often referred to as the negative evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the model.
 However, it relies on a synchronous architecture for collecting experiences, which is closely tied to its trust region optimization objective.
 Typically, an encoder-decoder framework is applied.
 GANs and their variants have shown impressive performance in synthesizing various types of datasets, especially natural images.
 Transfer learning delivers a neural network with good predictive power by duplicating and tuning the parameters for a pre-trained source model against a dataset for a new task (Dauphin et al., 2012; Donahue et al., 2014).
 The task here is to estimate the average long-term reward of a target policy, given historical data collected by (possibly unknown) behavior policies.
 Starting with the success of GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017) on achieving state-of-the-art performance on semi-supervised classification, several variants of GNNs have been developed for this task; including GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017), GAT (Velickovic et al., 2018), SGC (Wu et al., 2019), and GMNN (Qu et al., 2019) to name a few most recent ones.
 It is well-known that these networks trained with simple first-order methods can fit any labels, even completely random ones (Zhang et al., 2017).
 However, the use of generative models is often limited by the lack of control over the generated images.
 To learn underlying patterns from data and enable generalization beyond the training set, the learning approach incorporates appropriate inductive bias (Haussler, 1988; Baxter, 2000) by promoting representations which are simple in some sense.
 Rising to this challenge, sparse dictionary learning (SDL) provides a potent framework in representation learning that exploits the blessing of dimensionality: real data tends to lie in or near some low-dimensional subspaces or manifolds, even though the ambient dimension is often extremely large (e.g, the number of raw pixels in an image).
 For example, knowing when a person uses their microwave, stove, oven, coffee machine or toaster provides information about their eating patterns.
 Though immensely successful, theoretical understanding of deep learning lags behind.
 For Imperfect Information Games (IIG), a player has only partial knowledge about her opponents before making a decision, so that she has to reason under the uncertainty about her opponents’ information while exploiting the opponents’ uncertainty about herself.
 Recently, large pretrained models have largely subsumed word vectors based on their accuracy on downstream tasks, partly due to the fact that their word representations are context-dependent, allowing them to more richly capture the meaning of a word (Peters et al., 2018; Howard & Ruder, 2018; Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018).
 They are frequently used to explain how deep networks classify images in computer vision applications (Simonyan et al., 2014; Zeiler & Fergus, 2014; Springenberg et al., 2015; Ribeiro et al., 2016; Dabkowski & Gal, 2017; Fong & Vedaldi, 2017; Selvaraju et al., 2017; Shrikumar et al., 2017; Smilkov et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018) and to explain how agents choose actions in reinforcement learning (RL) applications (Bogdanovic et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Zahavy et al., 2016; Greydanus et al., 2017; Iyer et al., 2018; Sundar, 2018; Yang et al., 2018; Annasamy & Sycara, 2019).
 To capture user intent in an easy and intuitive way, many program synthesizers let its users provide a set of input-output examples I which the synthesized program should satisfy.
 This property has the potential to enhance the performance of neural network predictive models in applications where information is sparse in time and it is important to account for exact arrival times and delays.
 In addition, random forests have been applied to the head pose (Fanelli et al., 2011), landmark (Cootes et al., 2012) and age (Shen et al., 2018) estimation as a regressor and the sparse feature matching problems (Lepetit & Fua, 2006; Ozuysal et al., 2010).
 Transfer learning with the knowledge of models learned on a similar task can help to avoid overfitting.
 These models are used to extract contextualized word embeddings for transfer learning purposes (Devlin et al., 2019) and as natural language generators.
 An image of real-world objects comprises two independent components: object identity and camera pose.
 Adversarial samples typically expose over-sensitivity to semantically invariant text transformations (Belinkov & Bisk, 2017; Ettinger et al., 2017), e.g, character flips (Ebrahimi et al., 2018) or paraphrases (Ribeiro et al., 2018b; Iyyer et al., 2018).
 Despite their success, deep neural image classifiers are found to be easily fooled by visually imperceptible adversarial perturbations (Szegedy et al., 2013).
 This has fueled interest in few-shot learning, where only few labeled samples per class are available for training. fig.  1 displays a snapshot of the state-of-the-art.
 This has motivated significant amount of research in improving adversarial robustness of a machine learning model (see, e.g, Goodfellow et al., 2015; Madry et al., 2018).
 The objective originally proposed by Hinton et al., (2015) minimizes the KL divergence between the teacher and student outputs.
 As an important direction in superoptimization, symbolic expression simplification, or symbolic superoptimization, aims at transforming symbolic expression to a simpler form in an effective way, so as to avoid unnecessary computations.
 The performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) would be improved substantially when more supervised data is available or better data augmentation method is adapted.
 Basically, a model that generalizes well should obtain low error on unseen test examples, but this is difficult since the distribution of test data is unknown during training.
 In this context, discrimination is defined as the unwanted distinction against individuals based on their membership to a specific group.
 For example, we might have single-cell RNA-Seq datasets generated for the same tissue type from two different labs.
 Because of this, there exist a large range of scenarios in the wild in which practitioners wish to deploy these networks e.g, pedestrian detection in a vehicle’s computer, human activity recognition with wearables (Radu et al., 2018).
 In practice, the vast majority of datasets exhibit some degree of label noise.
 For example, in image generation, one might first sample the object identity and pose, and then render an image with the object in the correct pose.
 In addition, adversarial examples have an intriguing property of transferability, where adversarial examples crafted by the current model can also fool other unknown models.
 It is crucial to better understand the reason behind the generalization of modern deep learning models; such an understanding has multiple benefits, including providing guarantees for safety-critical scenarios and the design of better models.
 However, these blackbox models are generally difficult to analyze and their behavior is not guaranteed.
 Permutation equivariance is the property required of F so it is welldefined.
 For efficient use of system resources, these algorithms crucially must (i) enable parallelization while being communication efficient, and (ii) exhibit good generalization behaviour, i.g,good performance on unseen data (test-set).
 In medical imaging, the CycleGAN has found an important application for translating one modality to another, for instance in MR to CT translation (Han, 2017; Sjölund et al., 2015; Wolterink et al., 2017).
 Particularly, we focus on the zero-sum case of this problem which is also known as minimax optimization, i.g,,min x\\u2208Rn max y\\u2208Rm f(x,y).
 The way the information is provided, however, is vastly different from that of conventional deep learning where each minibatch is iid-sampled from the whole dataset.
 It creates a link between relational learning and invariant theory.
 Such knowledge graph embeddings have applications in knowledge graph completion, knowledge discovery, entity resolution, and link-based clustering, just to cite a few (Nickel et al., 2016a).
 While various imputing techniques, from imputing using global statistics such as mean, to individually imputing by learning auxiliary models such as GAN, can be applied with their own pros and cons, the most simple and natural way to do this is zero imputation, where we simply treat a missing feature as zero.
 In other words, GCNs have been becoming one of the most crucial tools for graph representation learning.
 This topic has gained a lot of attention from researchers in the fields of machine learning and computer vision because of its wide range of applications including image inpainting (Pathak et al., (2014); Iizuka et al., (2017)), super resolution (Dong et al., (2016); Kim et al., (2016)), colorization (Zhang et al., (2016; 2017)) and style transfer (Gatys et al., (2016); Huang & Belongie (2017)).
 Both from a generalization and an inference-time perspective, this is superfluous.
 Significant progress has been made in deep learning via supervised representation learning, where the labels, y, for the downstream task are known while p(y|x) is learned directly (Sutskever et al., 2012; Hinton et al., 2012).
 Such is the case in regimes as medical imaging (Lustig et al., 2007; Choi et al., 2010; Chernyakova & Eldar, 2014), radar (Baraniuk, 2007), and seismic surveying (Herrmann et al., 2012).
 On the other hand, poisoning examples that are intentionally added by attackers to achieve backdoor attacks could be treated as one type of “outliers” in the training dataset.
 Efficiently executing such graphs requires optimizing discrete decisions about how to map the computations in a graph onto hardware so as to minimize a relevant cost metric (e.g, running time, peak memory).
 Navigation tasks can be expressed in many forms, for example, point goal tasks involve navigating to a specific coordinates and semantic navigation involves finding path to a specific scene or object.
 Therefore, robustness, i.g,, the ability to cope with erroneous or malicious inputs fed to an application, is emerging as an important requirement for DNNs.
 This enables them to profit from the structure and symmetries in signal data such as images (Cohen & Welling, 2016).
 Tasks such Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) (Cadena et al., 2016), Structure-from-Motion (SfM) (Agarwal et al., 2010) and object detection assume that salient keypoints can be detected and re-identified in a wide range of scenarios, which requires invariance properties to lighting effects, viewpoint changes, scale, time of day, etc.
 Each of its layers contains millions of parameters accessed during the forward pass, making it computationally demanding in terms of memory and latency during both training and inference.
 Training models for other languages has been shown more difficult, and recent approaches relied on bilingual embeddings that allowed the transfer of supervision in high resource languages like English to models in lower resource languages; however, inducing these bilingual embeddings required some level of supervision (Upadhyay et al., 2016).
 When properly decomposed into meaningful abstract entities such as objects and spaces, this structured representation brings many advantages of abstract (symbolic) representation to areas where contemporary deep learning approaches with a global continuous vector representation of a scene have not been successful.
 A graph embedding problem is usually defined as a problem of finding a vector representation X ∈ RK for every node of a graph G = (V,E) through a mapping φ : V → X .
 Since knowledge graphs may contain incorrect, incomplete or duplicated records, additional processing such as link prediction, attribute classification, and record de-duplication is typically needed to improve the quality of knowledge graphs and derive new facts.
 Effective learning and generalisation to unseen data are paramount to IL success, especially in safety critical applications.
 Such methods offer two of the key success factors: 1) computational scalability by leveraging the simultaneous computational power of many devices, and 2) data-locality, the ability to perform joint training while keeping each part of the training data local to each participating device.
 The introduction of deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in solving many problems that were intractable in the field of RL, such as playing Atari games from pixels and performing robotic control tasks (Mnih et al., 2015; Lillicrap et al., 2015; Tassa et al., 2018).
 Pre-trained to solve an unsupervised task on large corpora of text, transformer-based architectures, such as GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2018), BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019), seem to possess the capacity to learn the underlying structure of text and, as a consequence, to learn representations that generalize across tasks.
 Examples include evaluating a recommendation policy (Swaminathan et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2018), a treatment policy (Hirano et al., 2003; Murphy et al., 2001), and a traffic light control policy (Van der Pol & Oliehoek, 2016).
 One way to think of this problem is in terms of curiosity or intrisic motivation: constructing reward signals that augment or even replace the extrinsic reward from the domain, which induce the RL agent to explore their domain in a way that results in effective longer-term learning and behavior (Pathak et al., 2017; Burda et al., 2018; Oudeyer, 2018).
 For example, Aytar et al., (2018), Pohlen et al., (2018) and Salimans and Chen (2018b) have shown that RL with demonstrations can address the hard exploration problem in Montezuma’s Revenge.
 The problem of solving rapidly a new task after learning several other similar tasks is called meta-learning (Schmidhuber, 1987; Bengio et al., 1991; Thrun & Pratt, 1998); typically, the data is presented in a two-level hierarchy such that each data point at the higher level is itself a dataset associated with a task, and the goal is to learn a meta-model that generalizes across tasks.
 They have been shown to be robust against adversarial attacks (Schott et al., 2019; Ghosh et al., 2019; Song et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Frosst et al., 2018), to enable robust classification in the presence of outliers (Nalisnick et al., 2019b) and to achieve promising results in semi-supervised learning (Kingma et al., 2014; Salimans et al., 2016).
 Some of the attributes are permanent i.g,the class identity of the object, whereas others are transitory e.g, the pose of the object.
 This has desirable benefits like a naturally definable inner-product, vector addition, or a closedform distance function.
 This is a difficult black-box optimization problem over a combinatorially large search space in which function evaluation relies on slow and expensive wet-lab experiments.
 However, even the most accurate deep learning models can be easily deceived by perturbations which are visually imperceptible to the human eye (Szegedy et al., 2013; Carlini et al., 2016).
 However, these works mostly have been focused on a single known task where the agent can be trained for a long time (e.g, Silver et al., (2016)).
 This mechanism is especially useful in situations where a proportion of detection targets is inherently small.
 These data structures, such as a uniform grid (Lecun et al., 1998), an unstructured graph (Kipf & Welling, 2016), or a hierarchical point set (Qi et al., 2016a; 2017), function as geometric reservoirs to yield intricate underpinning patterns by evolving the massive input data in a high-dimensional parameter space.
 In order to obtain reliable language representations, neural language models are designed to define the joint probability function of sequences of words in text with self-supervised learning.
 Binary convolutions are appealing mainly for two reasons: (a) Model compression: if the weights of the network are stored as bits in a 32-bit float, this implies a reduction of 32× in memory usage.
 The IB method has proved effective in a variety of scenarios, including improving the robustness against adversarial attacks (Alemi et al., 2016; Fischer, 2018), learning invariant and disentangled representations (Achille & Soatto, 2018a;b), underlying information-based geometric clustering (Strouse & Schwab, 2017b), improving the training and performance in adversarial learning (Peng et al., 2018), and facilitating skill discovery (Sharma et al., 2019) and learning goal-conditioned policy (Goyal et al., 2019) in reinforcement learning.
 Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has become the mainstream approach to discover efficient and powerful network structures (Zoph & Le (2017); Pham et al., (2018); Tan et al., (2019); Liu et al., (2019a)).
 The core idea consists in sequentially solving a series of parametric problems, starting from an easy-to-solve problem and progressively deforming it, via a homotopy function, to the target one.
 Specifically, given a pair of random variables x,y, the MI, denoted by I(x;y), is defined asI(x;y) = Ep(x,y)  log p(x,y)p(x)p(y) , (1)where E is the expectation over the given distribution.
 Building on top of them, modern state-of-the-art models, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), are able to learn powerful language representations from unlabeled text and even surpass the human performance on the challenging question answering task.
 That is, inductive bias and generalization are not achieved by limiting the size of the network, but rather by explicitly (Wei et al., 2019) or implicitly (Nacson et al., 2019; Lyu & Li, 2019) controlling the magnitude of the weights.
 They are based on an idea of a two-player game, in which a discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated data samples, while a generator tries to fool the discriminator, learning to produce realistic samples on the long run.
 From machine learning perspective, there is no guarantee that information accessed at a current task to be revisited later in future tasks.
 as IL) is a basic strategy to train agents for solving complicated tasks.
 The process of perceptual grouping determines which regions of the visual input belong together as parts of higher-order perceptual units.
 However, recent literature has shown that these widely deployed ML models are vulnerable to adversarial examples – carefully crafted perturbations aiming to mislead learning models (Carlini & Wagner, 2017; Kurakin et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2018b).
 In the original setting, GANs are composed of two neural networks trained with competing goals: the generator is trained to synthesize realistic samples to fool the discriminator and the discriminator is trained to distinguish real samples from fake ones produced by the generator.
 While shallow networks are celebrated as being universal approximators (Cybenko, 1989; Funahashi, 1989; Hornik et al., 1989) — they approximate continuous functions arbitrarily well over compact sets — what is more shocking is that gradient descent can learn the parameters to these networks, and they generalize (Zhang et al., 2016).
 When a scene is properly decomposed into meaningful entities such as foreground objects and background, we can benefit from numerous advantages of abstract symbolic representation.
 Models in such applications are valuable intellectual property of their creators, as developing them for commercial use is a product of intense labour and monetary effort.
 This is known as the domain shift problem: the changing conditions cause the statistical properties of the test, or target, data, to be different from those of the training, or source, data, and the network’s performance degrades accordingly.
Proper representation and estimation of uncertainty is important, e.g, when dealing with structural ambiguities in object pose estimation or coping with sensor corruption.
 Interestingly, we are not just able to recognize such modified objects, but are able to characterize which modifications have been applied to them as well.
 They require considerably less memory and have a lower computational complexity, since discretized values {q1, ..., qI} can be stored, multiplied and accumulated efficiently.
 For softmax (aka multinomial) regression, each gradient step incurs a cost proportional to the number of classes C.
 The most crucial concept which led to a reduction in search costs to the order of a single function evaluation is certainly the weight-sharing paradigm: Training only a single large architecture (the one-shot model) subsuming all the possible architectures in the search space (Brock et al., 2018; Pham et al., 2018).
 In particular, increasingly often, it is used as a component in decision-making systems.
 Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs allow connections among hidden units associated with a time delay.
 Generative models are a natural example of the need for geometric comparison of distributions.
 For example, a recent malware detection system MalConv, with a manually designed pipeline that combines embeddings and convolutions, achieves 6% better detection rate over previous state-of-the-art technique without pre-processing (Raff et al., 2018).
 Founded on bio-plausibility, the neurons in an SNN compute and communicate information through discrete binary events (or spikes) a significant shift from the standard artificial neural networks (ANNs), which process data in a real-valued (or analog) manner.
 While a wide range of defenses exist that harden neural networks against such attacks (Madry et al., 2017; Shafahi et al., 2019), defenses based on heuristics and tricks are often easily breakable Athalye et al., (2018).
 Such models are useful in any situation where translation needs to be done in real time.
 The recent development of representation learning holds great promises for improving data efficiency of training, and enables an easy adaption to different tasks using the same feature representation.
 First, training CNNs from random initializations to achieve high task accuracy generally requires a large amount of data that is expensive to collect.
 In general, it aims to recover an inherently sparse vector xs ∈ Rn from an observation y ∈ Rm corrupted by a noise vector ε ∈ Rm.
 Recently, Graph Neural Networks (graph NNs) (Duvenaud et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016; Gilmer et al., 2017; Hamilton et al., 2017; Kipf & Welling, 2017; Nguyen et al., 2017; Schlichtkrull et al., 2018; Battaglia et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019a) have emerged as a promising approach.
 Graphs provide explicit information about the coupling between individual units in a larger part along with a well defined framework for assigning properties to the nodes and the edges connecting them.
 However, there have been a myriad of demonstrations showing that deep neural networks can be easily fooled by carefully perturbing pixels in an image through what have become known as adversarial example attacks (Szegedy et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015; Carlini & Wagner, 2017b; Vorobeychik & Kantarcioglu, 2018).
 In particular, we consider the problem of estimating (the gradient of) the expectation of f(x) where x has a discrete distribution p over the domain D, i.g,Ex∼p(x)f(x) = ∑x∈D p(x)f(x).
 The framework of temporal point processes is a natural choice for modeling such data.
 While different layers of a neural network learn different “levels” of features, skip connections can help preserve low-level features and avoid performance degradation when adding more layers.
 Typically, each bilingual (or multilingual) parallel sentence pair is annotated manually by one image describing the content of this sentence pair.
 Among various recent approaches for addressing the few-shot classification problem, metric-based meta-learning methods (Garcia & Bruna, 2018; Sung et al., 2018; Vinyals et al., 2016; Snell et al., 2017; Oreshkin et al., 2018) have received considerable attention due to their simplicity and effectiveness.
 In real-world applications, the input distribution of the data (e.g, sensory inputs) is prone to constant changes due to environmental variations (e.g, seasonal changes), exposure to new situations (e.g, change in the surface friction), sensory malfunction (e.g, water droplets on a camera), among others.
 A key question in these settings is whether the algorithm makes fair decisions.
 One integral part of any supply chain is warehousing (storage); warehouse operations often have major impacts downstream on the capability to deliver product on time.
 The main idea behind GNNs is that the connections between neurons are not arbitrary but reflect the structure of the input data.
 For instance, using a large initial learning rate often improves generalization, which can come at the expense of the initial training loss reduction (Goodfellow et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2020).
 Decades of research in biological vision have suggested that biological visual systems extract these objects through visual routines for perceptual grouping, which rely on feedforward (or bottom-up) and potentially feedback (or recurrent) processes (Roelfsema, 2006; Roelfsema & Houtkamp, 2011; Wyatte et al., 2014).
 We can think of images as being convolved by an unknown filter (Figure 1).
 These techniques can be applied to a wide range of natural language processing applications such as machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015), summarization (Rush et al., 2015), and dialogue response generation (Zhao et al., 2017).
 Of particular relevance to humans will be agents that can sense and interact with objects in a physical world.
 In its early era, the great success of deep learning was promoted by novel neural architectures, such as ResNet (He et al., 2016), Inception (Szegedy et al., 2015), VGGNet (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015), and Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017).
 Deep transfer learning has been immensely successful in computer vision (Donahue et al., 2014; Girshick et al., 2014; Zeiler & Fergus, 2014) and natural language processing (Devlin et al., 2019; Peters et al., 2018; Mikolov et al., 2013).
 For example, it is more descriptive and engaging to respond “I’ve always been more of a fan of the American football team from Pittsburgh, the Steelers!” than “Nice, I like football too.” (Dinan & Weston, 2019).
 Examples include the tuning of hyperparameters in machine learning, the identification of control parameters, or the optimization of system designs.
 For a language with vocabulary of size d, a simple way to achieve this mapping is to use one-hot representation – each word is mapped to its own row of a d× d identity matrix.
 Over the years, several strategies have evolved.
 With the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs) this approach has recently experienced a small revolution, since they do not require any form of manual feature engineering and significantly outperform previous models (Gilmer et al., 2017; Schütt et al., 2017).
 such as image recognition (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), natural language processing (Devlin et al., 2018) and image synthesis tasks (Radford et al., 2015).
 Furthermore, with ever-increasing model size and available data, the amount of compute used was noted to increase exponentially over the past few years (Amodei & Hernandez, 2018).
 The theory of identifiability in linear independent component analysis (ICA) (Comon, 1994) tells us when this is possible, if we restrict the model to a linear transformation, but until recently there was no corresponding theory for the highly nonlinear models needed to manipulate complex data.
 Their efficiency in speed (fast algorithms) and space (few parameters) can reduce computation and memory usage.
 However, the excellent performance of modern DNNs comes at an often prohibitive training cost due to the required vast volume of training data and model parameters.
 In statistical learning, principled kernel methods have vastly improved the performance of SVMs and PCA (Suykens & Vandewalle, 1999; Schölkopf et al., 1997), and boosting theory has enabled weak learners to generate strong classifiers (Schapire, 1990).
 Performance on many downstream tasks have improved considerably, achieving parity with human baselines in benchmark leaderboards such as SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; 2018) and GLUE (Wang et al., 2019).
 In a layer of MPNNs, each node sends its feature representation, a “message”, to the nodes in its neighborhood; and then updates its feature representation by aggregating all “messages” received from the neighborhood.
 Famously, the steady-state distribution of a random walk on the World Wide Web provides the foundation of the PageRank algorithm (Langville & Meyer, 2004).
 Similar to the centralized parallel optimization (Jakovetic, 2013; Li et al., 2014a;b; Shamir et al., 2014; Zhang and Lin, 2015; Meng et al., 2016; Reddi et al., 2016; Richtárik and Takác, 2016; Smith et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2016; Shusen Wang et al., 2018), FL let the user devices (aka worker nodes) perform most of the computation and a central parameter server update the model parameters using the descending directions returned by the user devices.
 As the well-known dictum by Richard Feynman states, “what I cannot create, I do not understand.” Language generation therefore reflects the level of development of language understanding.
 The brittleness of neural networks can have costly consequences in areas such as autonomous driving, finance and healthcare.
 While direct attacks on the latter are possible, in this paper, we take a language-agnostic approach to improving Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN, Rumelhart et al., (1988)), which brought about many advances in tasks such as language modelling, semantic parsing, machine translation, with no shortage of non-NLP applications either (Bakker 2002; Mayer et al., 2008).
 Yet, most recent research on deep generative models ignores these problems, and instead focuses on qualitative sample quality and log-likelihood on heldout validation sets.
 To solve a Markov Decision Process (MDP), one common method is value iteration, which finds the optimal value function.
 However, despite these accomplishments, deep RL methods still are not nearly as reliable as their (deep) supervised counterparts.
 To overcome this limitation of conventional deep learning, recently, researchers have explored meta-learning (Schmidhuber, 1987; Thrun & Pratt, 1998) approaches, whose goal is to learn a model that generalizes well over distribution of tasks, rather than instances from a single task, in order to utilize the obtained meta-knowledge across tasks to compensate for the lack of training data for each task.
 It consists of an ordered sequence of nucleotides, with each nucleotide containing one of four bases: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C) and Uracile (U).
 While much research focuses on its use in unsupervised or semi-supervised settings with such diverse objectives as sparsity (Ranzato et al., 2007), generation (Kingma & Welling, 2013), and disentanglement (Chen et al., 2018), autoencoders are also useful in purely supervised settings—in particular, adding an auxiliary feature-reconstruction task to supervised classification problems has been shown to empirically improve generalization (Le et al., 2018); in the linear case, the theoretically quantifiable benefit matches that of simplistic norm-based regularization (Bousquet & Elisseeff, 2002; Rosasco & Poggio, 2009).
 To obtain these results, researchers have resorted to training ever larger Transformer models.
 It ranges from the formation of snow flakes, spots and rays on animal’s skin, to spiral galaxies.
 However, their increasing complexity makes it difficult to explain the model\\u2019s output.
 The production-rules of such grammars specify this structure by laying out valid type-combinations for components of an object, their inter-geometry, as well as the behaviour of these with respect to transformations on the input.
 In recent years, the TTS field has seen remarkable progress, sparked by the development of neural autoregressive models for raw audio waveforms such as WaveNet (van den Oord et al., 2016), SampleRNN (Mehri et al., 2017) and WaveRNN (Kalchbrenner et al., 2018).
 A key component of NPs is the embedding of context sets Z into a representation space through an encoder Z 7→ E(Z), which is achieved using a DEEPSETS function approximator (Zaheer et al., 2017).
Existing work: adversarial and provable defenses Adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Kurakin et al., 2017) provides a framework to augment the training procedure with adversarial inputs produced by an adversarial attack.
 However, due to data privacy concerns, network bandwidth limitation, and device availability, it’s impractical to gather all the data from the edge devices at the data center and conduct centralized training.
 Hence, it will be hard for them to generalize to new tasks without re-training even due to small changes.
 Nevertheless, certain limitations of deep learning are generally recognized, in particular, limitations due to the fact that deep learning approaches heavily depend on the availability of large amounts of labeled data.
 Many machine learning problems can be cast as composition problems that include two finite-sum structures: reinforcement learning (Sutton et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2016), variance-averse learning (Lian et al., 2017), and nonlinear embedding (Hinton & Roweis, 2003; Dikmen et al., 2015).
 Nevertheless, a rigorous interpretation of their success remains evasive (ShalevShwartz & Ben-David, 2014).
 An animal that is able to store and recall pertinent information about their environment is likely to exceed the performance of an animal whose behavior is purely reactive.
 Recent attacks have, however, cast serious doubts on the robustness of these defenses (Athalye et al., 2018; Carlini & Wagner, 2016).
 However, their success is heavily reliant on the quality of training data, especially accurate semantic labels for learning supervision.
 Regularization, loosely defined as any modification applied to a learning algorithm that helps prevent overfitting, plays therefore a key role in machine learning (Girosi et al., 1995; Müller, 2012).
 Since they are not directly differentiable, discrete random variables do not mesh well with the workhorse of modern Deep Learning, that is the backpropagation algorithm.
 Towards the first and third goal, we introduce the Random Projection Tree (RP Tree) to similarity measurement.
 However, this advancement has been mostly limited to certain domains.
 This progress has been fueled by ‘black-box’ machine learning models where the decision making is controlled by complex non-linear interactions between many parameters that are difficult for humans to understand and interpret.
 Machine learning models are well-known to improve when trained on large-scale and high-quality datasets (Hestness et al., 2017; Najafabadi et al., 2015).
 Recently, the seminal work of Gatys et al., (2015) firstly captured the style of artistic images and transferred it to other images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
 Given an arbitrary image, an object detection system needs to determine whether there are any instances of semantic objects from predefined categories and, if present, to return the spatial location and extent.
 As a tendency, seeking effective neural networks gradually becomes an important and practical direction.
 Recent studies (Szegedy et al., 2013), however, show that most of these deep learning models are very vulnerable to adversarial attacks.
 In audio research, neural networks such as VGGish (Hershey et al., 2017) and Wave-U-Net (Stoller et al., 2018) have shown great success in audio classification, audio source separation, and many other challenging tasks.
 Deep UDA methods bring noticeable performance gain to many tasks (Long et al., 2015; Saito et al., 2017; Richter et al., 2016; Tsai et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019; Vu et al., 2019a) by exploiting supervision from heterogeneous sources.
Despite these successes, RL agents that learn only from reward signals differ in the manner that humans learn.
 As one of the most effective approaches, collaborative filtering Sarwar et al., (2001); Koren & Bell (2015); He et al., (2017) and its deep neural networks based variants He et al., (2017); Wu et al., (2016); Liang et al., (2018); Li & She (2017); Yang et al., (2017); Wang et al., (2018) have been widely studied.
 The theoretical properties of gradient descent have been widely studied in the literature; study of the convergence bounds and guarantees 6, 12, 15, 13, the characterization of the local geometry of stationary points 21, 11, 10, 19, 25, 30, 24, 23, 13, exploration of better algorithms to optimize the descent process 28, 16, 26, 33, 7 are just a few example of active research areas in this domain.
 Despite their increasing popularity, flexibility, generality, and performance, DNNs have been recently shown to be quite susceptible to small imperceptible input noise (Szegedy et al., 2014; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016; Goodfellow et al., 2015).
 Despite this success, DNNs are still susceptible to small imperceptible perturbations, which can lead to drastic performance degradation, especially in visual classification tasks.
 These measures are all taken to provide evidence that some units respond highly selectively to categories of objects under some conditions.
 However, ANNs fail to uptake the advantages of the Neuronal Dynamics, which instantiates as high-power consumption, relatively low responses and etc.
 This approach was popularized with the introduction of Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) in 20 and has led to a plethora of additional normalization methods, notably including Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) 6 and Weight Normalization (WeightNorm) 28.
 Learning vector representations of graphs is effective for a variety of prediction and graph analysis tasks (Grover & Leskovec (2016); Tang et al., (2015)).
 In addition, model compression has become an important technique due to an increase in the model capacity and the number of parameters in CNN.
 These are modeled via the generative model pθ(z, x) = pθ(z)pθ(x|z) which gives rise to the marginal likelihood pθ(x) = ∫ Z pθ(z, x) dz of the model parameters θ.
 Therefore, nowadays, many computervision-based systems, such as automatic-driving cars, security surveillance cameras, and robotics, are built on the power of CNNs.
 A number of convolutional neural network (CNN) based semantic segmentation systems have been developed in recent years such as Chen et al., (2017a;b; 2018); Long et al., (2015); Zhao et al., (2017); Ronneberger et al., (2015).
 These methods split a dataset into multiple batches and then optimize them sequentially by gradient descent in each epoch.
 It is beneficial to train an autonomous agent in real environments, but not practical, since enough data cannot be gathered Collins et al., (2018).
 Various techniques have been developed ranging from the sample-based to more computational ones such as the additive/subtractive synthesis, frequency modulation granular synthesis, and even a full physicsbased simulation (Cook, 2002).
 Yet, high performance is not always a sufficient factor - as some realworld deployment scenarios might necessitate that an ideal AI system is ‘interpretable’, such that it builds trust by explaining rationales behind decisions, allow detection of common failure cases and biases, and refrains from making decisions without sufficient confidence.
 Multi-Frame Super-Resolution (MFSR) (Tsai, 1984) aims to reconstruct hidden high-resolution details from multiple low-resolution views of the same scene.
 Training such large models efficiently while meeting device constraints, like memory limitations, necessitate partitioning of the underlying dataflow graphs for the models across multiple devices.
 Such models have found applications in chemoinformatics (Ralaivola et al., (2005); Rupp & Schneider (2010); Ferré et al., (2017)) and bioinformatics (Borgwardt et al., (2005); Kundu et al., (2013)), neuroscience (Sharaev et al., (2018); Jie et al., (2016); Wang et al., (2016)), computer vision (Stumm et al., (2016)) and system security (Li et al., (2016)), natural language processing (Glavaš & Šnajder (2013)), and others (Kriege et al., (2019); Nikolentzos et al., (2019)).
 They are powerful tools for representation learning and serve as core components of deep learning systems.
 Among these tasks, image classification is considered as one of the fundamental tasks since classification networks are commonly used as base networks for other problems.
 Most unsupervised training methods focus on the first stage: representation learning.
 GP poses a Gaussian prior over function values f and assumes observations y are generated independently given f .
 Fast learning algorithms are being proposed, criticised, and improved.
 The goal in multi-image feature matching is to take 2D feature positions from three or more images and find which ones correspond to the same point in the 3D scene.
 These models are usually trained with stochastic gradient descent or its variants.
 Since first-order stationary points could be saddle points with inferior generalization performance (Dauphin et al., 2014), in this work we are particularly interested in computing ( , √ )-approximate second-order stationary points, -SOSP:‖∇F (x )‖ ≤ and ∇2F (x ) < − √ L2 I. (2)To find a local minimum of problem (1), the cubic regularization approach (Nesterov & Polyak, 2006) and the trust region algorithm (Conn et al., 2000; Curtis et al., 2017) are two classical methods.
 One of the most critical problems in multi-task learning is the problem known as negative transfer, where unreliable knowledge from other tasks adversely affects the target task.
 The originally designed Transformer places the layer normalization between the residual blocks, which is usually referred to as the Transformer with Post-Layer Normalization (Post-LN).
 BatchNorm (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) is a milestone technique in the development of DNN, and nowadays it has become a default component to construct modern deep networks.
 However, in some scenarios, the learned representation should be invariant to some attribute of the input data.
 For example, imagine various pick-and-place robots working in factories all over the world.
 Regular vector space metrics, such as the L2 distance were shown to be very unreliable (Wang et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2018), and the advent of deep learning techniques with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) made it possible to more reliably evaluate complex data domains such as natural images, texts (Benajiba et al., 2018), or speech (Wang et al., 2018).
 Many molecular datasets consist of molecular graphs with feature vectors associated to each atom, and numerous methods based on GNN has been proposed to date just for learning the features of chemical molecules (Wu et al., 2018; Duvenaud et al., 2015; Kearnes et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017; Gilmer et al., 2017; Shang et al., 2018), such as those pertaining to electrical conductivity and toxicity.
 A number of approaches have been proposed for this problem (Schroff et al., 2015a; Sohn, 2016; MovshovitzAttias et al., 2017; Song et al., 2016; Xuan et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2018; Ge, 2018).
 Deep learning models for such tasks have achieved great success, driven in part by the development of attention mechanisms that focus on various objects in the scene while generating captions.
 Many parallels exist between physical science problems and those in computer vision.
 Efforts to prevent such attacks typically seek one of three solutions: (1) Models which preserve differential privacy (DP) (Dwork et al., 2006), a rigorous formulation of privacy in probabilistic terms; (2) Adversarial training algorithms, which augment training data to consist of benign examples and adversarial examples crafted during the training process, thereby empirically increasing the classification accuracy given adversarial examples (Kardan & Stanley, 2017; Matyasko & Chau, 2017); and (3) Provable robustness, in which the model classification given adversarial examples is theoretically guaranteed to be consistent, i.g,, a small perturbation in the input does not change the predicted label (Cisse et al., 2017; Kolter & Wong, 2017).
 Recently, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to build a vector search engine to support semantic search (Chen et al., 2018; Sullivan, 2018; Wang et al., 2018a; Johnson et al., 2017), which leverages high-quality neural ranking models (Nogueira & Cho, 2019; Xiong et al., 2017; Zamani et al., 2018a) to encode both natural language query and documents into dense continuous feature vectors and performs similarity search to retrieve relevant documents with vast data volumes (e.g, based on Euclidean distance).
 Its huge empirical success in different engineering disciplines is grounded on the expressive power of RNN.
 Recognizing mathematical expressions is receiving increasing attentions for application in digitization and retrieval of printed documents.
 However, many real-world problems have sparse rewards and most existing algorithms struggle with such sparsity.
 For example, image classification accuracy keeps improving as the depth of network models grows (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014; Szegedy et al., 2015; He et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017).
 These model architectures have been designed and calibrated by domain experts with rich engineering experience.
 In traditional vision pipelines, a common approach to localizing entities is to select the top-K responses in a heatmap and use their locations (Lowe, 2004; Bay et al., 2008; Felzenszwalb et al., 2010).
 Nevertheless, a major unresolved issue of deep learning is its vulnerability to adversarial samples that are almost indistinguishable from natural samples to humans but can mislead deep neural networks (DNNs) to make wrong predictions with high confidence (Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014).
 A common practice to train an adversarially robust model is based on a specific form of min-max training, known as adversarial training (AT) (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Madry et al., 2017), where the minimization step learns model weights under the adversarial loss constructed at the maximization step in an alternative training fashion.
 Current deep neural networks are capable of achieving remarkable performance on a single task (Goodfellow et al., 2016).
 Standard supervised learning methods suffer from the problem of catastrophic forgetting, in which case the models gradually forget previously learned knowledge while learning on a sequence of new tasks.
 Compared to fully-connected networks, CNNs through spatial weight sharing have the benefit of being translation-equivariant, i.g,, translating the input leads to a translated version of the output.
 Deep and wide networks are often over-parameterized, which significantly increase the usage of memory (with tens of millions of weights) and compute (with tens of billions of MAC - Multiplication and ACcumulation).
 On ride-sharing platforms, customers keep sending requests with origins and destinations at each moment.
 In many cases, such samples are quite expensive to obtain (e.g, requires interactions with the physical environment).
 To tackle this problem, researchers have explored network sparsification methods to remove unnecessary connections in a network, which is implementable either by weight pruning (Han et al., 2016) or sparsity-inducing regularizations (Wen et al., 2016).
 It aims at clustering data samples of high similarity into the same cluster.
 These models enable exact latent-variable inference and likelihood estimation.
 Many deep metalearning methods optimize for generalization by directly minimizing the loss of held-out validation data.
 Despite their success in generating high-quality samples, these models are hard to be deployed into real-world applications on edge devices because of their huge demands for computation and storage capacity.
 Many variants of GANs (Ho & Ermon, 2016; Abadi & Andersen, 2016; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Li et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2018) have also been introduced to reinforce the stability of training processes to obtain more realistic models.
 Despite the significant performance gains achieved by these complex models, they offer little transparency concerning their inner workings.
 It is widely used in public opinion monitoring, advertising filtering, user and product analysis and other fields.
 Differing from other unsupervised learning methods for model generation that concentrate on the hard optimization of the measure of distribution fit such as the maximum likelihood method, GANs, which are a kind of methods of implicit models (Mohamed & Lakshminarayanan, 2017; Tran et al., 2017), can be seen as a game between two networks, the generator and the discriminator.
 In an ideal world, accurate, continuous assessment of a patient’s condition helps with prevention and treatment.
 Typically, humans have strong prior knowledge about a task, e.g, based on symmetry, geometry, or physics.
 Hence, RL by artificial neural networks can be used as a model for learning in the brain (Bishop et al., 1995).
 We can largely categorize the model-based deep RL algorithms into two types: 1.
 Many problems in computer vision and graphics can be cast as I2I translation, such as photo-realistic image synthesis (Chen & Koltun (2017); Isola et al., (2017); Wang et al., (2018a)), super-resolution (Ledig et al., (2017)), colorization (Zhang et al., (2016; 2017a)), and inpainting (Pathak et al., (2016)).
 Image captioning is a multimodal task: it combines text generation with the detection and identification of objects in the image, along with their relations.
 Classical methods such as finite differences, finite volume and finite elements are numerical discretization-based methods where the domain is divided into a uniform grid or polygon mesh.
 However, researchers have designed adversarial examples to launch targeted attacks towards ASR systems (Vaidya et al., (2015); Carlini et al., (2016)).
 It determines how fast we get close to a minima, which in turn determines the computational cost of optimization.
 Recently, a novel machine learning model for graph data called graph neural networks (GNNs) (Gori et al., 2005; Scarselli et al., 2009; Kipf & Welling, 2017; Hamilton et al., 2017) demonstrated state-of-the-art performances in various graph learning tasks.
 Robbins Robbins (1952) formulated the setting in 1952: it includes a learner having K arms (options/choices) to explore given little knowledge about the properties of each arm.
 In real-world scenarios, such domain shifts are introduced by many factors, such as different illumination, viewing angles, and resolutions.
 However, when training data is scarce, overfitting will occur and the resulting model will be generalized poorly.
 The main bottleneck for the efficient creation of datasets remains the annotation process.
 However, CNNs are limited to data that can be represented by a grid in the Euclidean domain, such as images (2D grid) and text (1D grid), which hinders their application in irregularly structured datasets.
This assumption, although reasonable, is not necessarily true for many real-world applications.
For several of these tasks, data can be plentiful for high-resource languages like English, Chinese, German, Spanish and French, but both the collection and proliferation of data is limited for low-resource languages like Urdu.
For instance, when training a machine learning model on user-provided data, malicious users can carry out a data poisoning attack: providing false data with the aim of corrupting the learned model (Steinhardt et al., 2017; Tran et al., 2018; Jagielski et al., 2018).
 This is driven in part by the practical advantages promised by continual learning schemes such as improved performance on subsequent tasks as well as a more efficient use of resources in machines with memory constraints.
 Despite such simplicity and, arguably because of it, the resulting models are cumbersome, which may cause problems in training and deploying them in a limited resource setting.
 These models have emerged as better alternatives to the recurrent models - RNNs (Sutskever et al., 2014), LSTMs (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) and GRUs (Cho et al., 2014).
 End-to-end neural network-based approaches have seen significant progress in recent years (Wang et al., 2017; Taigman et al., 2018; Ping et al., 2018; Sotelo et al., 2017), even matching human performance for short assistant-like utterances (Shen et al., 2018).
 Here, the joint probability of the sequence is factorized in a pre-determined order during train and test time.
 In natural language processing, various studies have been conducted on word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013a;b; Pennington et al., 2014; Peters et al., 2018; Bojanowski et al., 2017).
 SGD iteratively updates model parameters in the negative gradient direction and thus seamlessly scales to large-scale settings.
 The size and accuracy of generated results has greatly improved to the point where samples from the latent space decode to photo-realistic samples (Brock et al., 2018; Razavi et al., 2019).
 Pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), XLNet (Yang et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) and SpanBERT (Joshi et al., 2019), have achieved great success in many NLP tasks (e.g, the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2018) and the challenging multi-hop reasoning task (Ding et al., 2019)).
 Developing new state-of-the-art architectures often takes a vast amount of engineering and domain knowledge.
 As a result, improving the energy-efficiency of CNNs while maintaining their attractive features (e.g, accuracy for a task) has gained tremendous research momentum in recent years.
 In a split second, billions of photons reaching her retinas carrying an enormous amount of information: the shade of the lioness’ fur, the angle of its tail, the appearance of every bush in her field of view, the mountains in the background and the clouds in the sky.
 These models are used to formulate the distribution of complex data as a function of random noise passed through a network, so that rendering samples from the distribution is particularly easy.
 However, we are still at the early stage for such sophisticated controlling of simulated characters.
 Taking the object classification task as an example, as the network depth increases from the 8-layer network AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) to the 16-layer network VGG (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) and to the 101-layer network ResNet (He et al., 2015), the classification accuracy constantly improves.
 They offer strong promise towards the goal of a joint understanding of concepts across languages, as well as for enabling the transfer of knowledge and machine learning models between different languages.
 Moreover, in applications such as drug discovery and network simulation, graph generative models that can approximate distributions over graphs on a specific domain and derive new samples from them are very important.
 In the market there are many application programming interfaces (APIs) serving predictions in object recognition for images (Vision AI1), language detection or sentiment analysis in natural language processing (Cloud Natural Language API2), to mention just a few.
 One stream of neural architectures search (NAS) methods is based on reinforcement learning (RL) (Zoph & Le, 2016; Zoph et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2019), where a neural architecture is built from actions and its performance is used as reward.
 Arguably the most impressive results have been in image synthesis (Brock et al., 2018; Salimans et al., 2018; Miyato et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; 2017), but they have also been applied fruitfully to text generation (Fedus et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2018), domain transfer learning (Zhu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Isola et al., 2017), and various other tasks (Xian et al., 2018; Ledig et al., 2017; Zhu & Bento, 2017).
 Many priors were studied in computer science problems such as low-rank representation (Pearson, 1901; Hotelling, 1933; Hitchcock, 1927; Tucker, 1966), smoothness (Grimson, 1981; Poggio et al., 1985; Li, 1994), sparseness (Tibshirani, 1996), non-negativity (Lee & Seung, 1999; Cichocki et al., 2009), statistical independence (Hyvarinen et al., 2004), and so on.
 In general, a graph can be viewed as a network of nodes and edges, where nodes correspond to individual objects and edges encode relationships among those objects.
 Remarkably, model over-parameterization helps both optimization and generalization.
 Researchers had designed many successful Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures, from just have a few convolution layers like LeNet (LeCun et al., 1998) and AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), to have more than 10 layers, e.g, VGG (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) and GoogleLeNet (Szegedy et al., 2015), and even have hundreds and thousands of layers like ResNet (He et al., 2016a).
 Despite the definite progress made, policy gradient algorithms still heavily suffer from sample inefficiency (Kakade, 2003; Wu et al., 2017; Schulman et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017).
 Amharic serves as the official working language of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and it is the second most spoken Semitic language in the world after Arabic with a total speakers of around 22 million, as per the census of 2007Asker (2010).
 For a concrete example, consider the dynamic treatment regime (Chakraborty & Murphy, 2014).
 If one would need to update the model with new data, it would require to merge the old and new data and process a training from scratch on this new dataset.
 Therefore, there is an increasing demand for corresponding detection devices.
 We especially focus on introducing an invertible function that is tuned for the use in graph structured data, which allows for flexible mappings with less number of parameters than previous invertible models for graphs.
 A typical approach for employing memory- and computation-efficient components is separable convolution, which is a combination of depth-wise and point-wise convolutions (Iandola et al., 2016; Zoph et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Howard et al., 2017), structured/unstructured pruning of connections and activations, and quantizing activation, weight, and their vectors (Stock et al., 2019; Jegou et al., 2011; Gong et al., 2014).
 A recent line of work has focused on the statistical properties of both the activations and the gradients of different architectures at the point of initialization, in order to better understand the effect of different architectural choices on the training dynamics.
 Recently various stochastic neural network instantiations have been topical in their applications to reducing overfitting (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Neelakantan et al., 2015) and training data requirements (Garnelo et al., 2018), providing confidence estimates on predictions (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016), enabling network compression (Dai et al., 2018), improving robustness to adversarial attack (Alemi et al., 2017), improving optimization (Neelakantan et al., 2015), generative modeling (Kingma & Welling, 2014), and inputting or producing probability distributions (de Bie et al., 2019; Frogner et al., 2019).
 Previous approaches have avoided this issue by limiting the generation problem: program synthesis approaches (Manna and Waldinger, 1971) are tailored to domain-specific languages (Gulwani, 2011), semantic parsing approaches focus on highly templated datasets (Ling et al., 2016; Shin et al., 2019) or SQL (Yu et al., 2018; Dong and Lapata, 2018), while other recent approaches generate code in general languages like Java and C#, but severely restrict the syntax, vocabulary or nature of the generated expressions (Murali et al., 2017; Brockschmidt et al., 2019a).
 The GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2018), for example, was designed to be a set of challenging NLU tasks, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and textual entailment; yet, current state of the art systems surpass human performance estimates on the average score of its subtasks (Yang et al., 2019).
 However, the performance heavily relies on the abundance of data annotated with ground-truth labels.
 Given a time-varying function x(t), represented by a sequence of data points xt, t = 1, . , N , our goal is to find a function ż(t) ∝ ∂∂tz(t) that encodes a representation of the local changes ẋ(t) ∝ ∂∂tx(t).
 With a large amount of such comparison data, one can consider various interesting tasks.
 The theory of compressive sensing (Candes et al., (2006)) allows us to retrieve the original signal from a corrupted measurement, under some structural assumptions on the measurement mechanism and the signal.
 Recently, many Deep Clustering approaches were proposed, which modified (Variational) Autoencoder ((V)AE) architectures (Min et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017) or with varying regularization of the latent representation (Dizaji et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017; Fortuin et al., 2019).
 However, high-performance of deep neural network is often gained by increasing the depth or the width of a network.
 In literature, the majority of deep learning models pursue boosted performance from different aspects (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014; Szegedy et al., 2015; He et al., 2016; 2015; Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015).
 In reality, they are typically collected from different but related domains, leading to a phenomenon known as domain shift (QuioneroCandela et al., 2009).
 Examples of such structures are social networks (e.g, Facebook), protein-protein interaction networks, the Web, etc.
 This is particularly true for deep learning systems that are data-hungry.
 The training process often needs access to some private dataset, e.g, applications in financial and medical fields.
 To name just a few: Depth from a single image (Eigen et al., 2014), Object localization and Acoustic localization (Vera-Diaz et al., 2018).
 In pursuit of generality in artificial intelligence, video games have become an important testing ground: they require a wide set of skills such as perception, exploration and control.
 These treatments, though, are often administered at a certain dosage which can take on continuous values (such as vasopressors (Döpp-Zemel & Groeneveld, 2013)).
 Being able to evaluate and compare these innovations in a timely manner is critical for their adoption.
 The need for supervision may be reduced by decoupling representation learning from the end task and/or using additional training data that are unlabeled, weakly labeled (with noisy labels), or belong to different domains or classes.
 To learn the optimal policy from the delayed reward decision system is the fundamental goal of RL.
 In order to provide insight into the inner workings of DNNs, the prospect of utilizing the Mutual Information (MI), a measure of dependency between two random variables, has recently garnered a significant amount of attention (Cheng et al., 2018; Noshad et al., 2019; Saxe et al., 2018; Shwartz-Ziv & Tishby, 2017; Yu et al., 2018; Yu & Principe, 2019).
 However, model personalization usually assumes the availability of user data on a centralized server.
 However, one prominent issue is that of overfitting, illustrated in figure 1: agents trained on one domain fail to generalize to other domains that differ only in small ways from the original domain (Sutton, 1996; Cobbe et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018b; Packer et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018a; Witty et al., 2018; Farebrother et al., 2018).
 Despite these advancements, deep neural networks were found to be vulnerable to malicious perturbations on the original input data.
 Various works have been done to recover the details from low-resolution image and generate realistic high-resolution image.
 Often computers fail to understand the relevant characteristics of an image for classification (Ribeiro et al., 2016) or fail to generalize locally, i.g,, misclassify examples close to the training data (Szegedy et al., 2013).
 It has been applied in many ways, including human action recognition, human-computer interaction, recently popular object detection and so on.
 Yet, in the face of such significant developments, the age-old stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and the accelerated variant SGD with momentum (SGDM), algorithm remains one of the most, if not the most, popular method for training DNNs (Sutskever et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2017).
 However, these large number of weights and high computational cost enabled only limited applications for mobile devices that require the constraint on memory space being low as well as for devices that require real-time computations (Canziani et al., 2016).
 They are trained using stochastic gradient methods, where (i) data is subsampled into mini-batches, and (ii) the network parameters are iteratively updated by the gradient of the parameter weights, relative to a loss function for the given labeled mini-batch of data.
 However, the success of deep-based approaches relies greatly on using a large amount of human labeled data for supervision, which is usually very costly and infeasible to scale on new data.
 For example, in document classification, one document can cover different topics; in computer vision, one scene image can contain multiple semantic classes like mountain, beach and sea.
 The dominant methods for generative modeling, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), are currently able to produce diverse photorealistic images (Brock et al., 2019; Karras et al., 2019).
 Key properties of OT include its non-singular behavior, when comparing measures with disjoint supports, and the fact that OT inspired objectives can be seen as lifting similarity measures between samples to similarity measures between probability measures.
 For example, air quality monitoring systems employ a collection of observation stations at different locations; at each location, multiple sensors concurrently record different measurements such as PM2.5 and CO over time.
 In many real scenarios, the existence of expert demonstrations has been well perceived as a critical value to enhance the capability of reinforcement learning algorithms.
 This method is conceptually natural and offers extensibility and robustness, shows a surprisingly smooth, flexible, and fast system for instance segmentation results.
 Because of abundant redundancy in DNN models (Han et al., 2016; Frankle & Carbin, 2019; Courbariaux et al., 2015) and limited scaling technology of integrated circuits due to physical challenges, numerous model compression techniques are being aggressively studied to expedite inference of DNNs across a range of device scales.
 Neural architecture search (NAS), which has been formulated as a graph search problem, can potentially reduce the need for application-specific expert designers allowing for a wide-adoption of sophisticated networks in various industries.
 However, regarding classification, one of the issues that prevent widespread adoption of such solutions is their overconfidence in their predictions (Amodei et al., 2016).
 Due to various reasons, observations may be missing from such time series.
 After choosing an action, the agent will receive a stochastic reward generated from some unknown distribution conditioned on the chosen action’s feature vector.
 Erroneous DL models may lead to severe consequences.
 Hence they have become the primary choice for a majority of image generation tasks.
 This is usually achieved by optimizing over the input space in order to maximize the activation of a single neuron or filter, with appropriate regularization.
 In particular, 3D point clouds can represent geometric details of the object, and suitable for simple geometric transformation.
 Summarization models can be categorized into two classes: abstractive and extractive.
 However, in the context of continual learning, where tasks and data arrive in sequence, neither of these two principles is desirable.
 Recent works Kim & Mnih (2018); Chen et al., (2018); Kumar et al., (2017) suggest that decomposing the ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound) could lead to distinguishing the factor of disentanglement.
 Most of these models are trained on large labeled datasets via supervised learning.
 In this article we present a simple method for estimating confidence based on implied loss values which leads to results which are empirically more accurate than benchmarks on test sets.
 Each of these tasks is presented as a stream of input-output pairs, where each pair is drawn from the corresponding task probability distribution.
 This concept is inspired by human’s ability to generalize the knowledge with abstract concepts and use them to reason the unseen environments Gupta et al., (2018).
 However, application to physical systems has proven to be challenging in general, due to expensive and slow data generation as well as safety challenges when running untrained policies.
 For example in human activity logs, the video data can be missing in bathrooms by ethical reasons but can be supplied by environmental sensors which have less ethical problems.
 Furthermore, learning what metric is most “consistent” with the input distances or the metric that best captures the relevant geometric features of the data (e.g, the correlation structure in the data) is a key step in efficient, approximation algorithms for classification, clustering, regression, feature selection, etc.
 Dropout has been shown effective across a wide range of machine learning tasks, from classification (Srivastava et al., 2014; Szegedy et al., 2015) to regression (Toshev & Szegedy, 2014).
 Training on out-of-domain data can lead to worse model performance, while using more relevant data can assist transfer learning.
 Recently, the task of question-answering has been largely used as a proxy to evaluate the reading capabilities of neural architectures.
 In contrast, artificial learners require large amounts of labeled data to reach comprable levels (Dodge & Karam, 2017).
 Additionally, multilingual pre-trained models enable many NLP applications for other languages via zero-short cross-lingual transfer.
 Recent work has applied end-to-end, representation-learning-based methods to this challenge, where a neural-network-based agent is optimized to process language input, perceive its surroundings and execute appropriate movements jointly (Oh et al., 2017; Hermann et al., 2017; Chaplot et al., 2018).
 The aim of DR is to provide a low-dimensional representation (typically in 2D or 3D) of a given high-dimensional dataset that preserves the overall structure of the data as much as possible.
 An explanation for their superior performance is attributed to their ability to automatically learn suitable features from data.
 One widely adopted framework for measuring privacy characteristics of randomized algorithms, such as machine learning techniques, is differential privacy (Dwork et al., 2006).
 Yet, to date little is understood about how fake news spread on social networks, when a piece of fake news is effective in swaying public opinion and what interventions might be successful in mitigating the effect of fake news.
This is due to the lack of good pre-training methods.
Among the RNNs, the convolutional long short-term memory network (C-LSTM) (Shi et al. (2015)) is especially suited for sequences of images, since it learns both spatial and temporal dependencies simultaneously.
In the case of fewshot classification, a model must classify examples from novel classes, based on only a few labelled examples from each class.
 This is attributable to the fact that genome sequencing is a tool of utmost importance for a variety of fields, such as biology and medicine, where it is used to identify changes in genes or aid in the discovery of potential drugs (Methé et al., 2012; Qin et al., 2010).
 Dithering refers to the act of adding random noise to a quantized signal (e.g, an image or a time series) for the purposes of diminishing the effect that quantization has on it.
 Critical safety concerns have been brought due to lack of considering diverse causes of uncertainties, resulting in high risk due to misinterpretation of uncertainties (e.g, misdetection or misclassification of an object by an autonomous vehicle).
 These meaning representations can be executed in various environments, making semantic parsing applicable in many frameworks such as querying data/knowledge bases for question answering (Zelle & Mooney, 1996; Zettlemoyer & Collins, 2007; Liang et al., 2011; Berant et al., 2013), generating regular expression (Kushman & Barzilay, 2013), instruction following (Artzi & Zettlemoyer, 2013), and communicating with robots (Chen & Mooney, 2011; Tellex et al., 2011; Bisk et al., 2016).
 An example of non-robust feature is the presence of desert in camel images, which may correlate well with this object class.
 Let P be the number of workers in a distributed setting, and x ∈ Rd denotes the model parameters with d dimensions.
 While achieving good asymtotic performances in many high dimensional problems (Mnih et al., 2015; Silver et al., 2017; Schulman et al., 2017; Hessel et al., 2018; Espeholt et al., 2018), MFRL methods suffer from high sample complexity since they learn state/state-action values only from rewards and do not explicitly exploit the rich information underlying the transition dynamics data.
 These mathematical expressions are much more like discovered mathematical laws that have been an essential part of the natural sciences for centuries.
 With their remarkable ability of fitting training data, DNNs have achieved revolutionary successes in many fields such as computer vision, natural language progressing, and robotics.
 Therefore practical Bayesian inference often resort to approximations, and various approximate inference methods have been developed.
 However, most of the classification algorithms proposed so far make the assumption that data generated from all the class conditional distributions are available during training time i.g,, they make the closed-world assumption.
 Yet the behavior of SGD on high-dimensional neural network models still eludes full theoretical understanding, both in terms of its convergence and generalization properties.
 Semi-supervised learning (SSL) (Chapelle et al., 2009) is one of the most promising methods of leveraging unlabeled data to address this weakness.
 In practice, the main algorithms of choice are Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) (Robbins & Monro, 1951) and adaptive gradient methods such as AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) or Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015).
 Among others, research in remote sensing promises to help in solving challenges in food security (precision farming), water sustainability, disaster prevention (floods/landslides/earthquake forecasting), deforestation or wild fire detection, urban planning, and monitoring of carbon stocks and fluxes or the air quality.
 Generation of natural video is an obvious further challenge for generative modeling, but one that is plagued by increased data complexity and computational requirements.
 A classifier which correctly classifies an image x, can be fooled by an adversary to misclassify an adversarial example x + δ, such that x + δ is indistinguishable from x to a human.
 This can result in better generalization and more robust feature representations.
 This inability to transfer or adapt policies is one major reason why RL has still not proliferated physical application like robotics.
 For these data types, a major enabler of the rapid research and development progress is the availability of canonical neural network architectures to efficiently encode the raw data into meaningful representations.
 One common scheme for the standard proxy-based neural architecture search methods (Pham et al., 2018; Zoph et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019b) is to factorise the search space via repeatedly stacking the same cell structure, within which a computing block generates an output tensor Fk by combining the transformations of two input feature tensors Fi and Fj : Fk “ oiÑk pFiq ‘ ojÑk pFjq s.t. i ă k & j ă k, (1) where oiÑk and ojÑk are the i-th and j-th primitive operations for feature transformation, selected from a candidate operation set O, and ‘ is the element-wise addition.
 However, to train these models one often needs access to very large amounts of labeled data, which can be costly to produce.
 Early work in linguistics established that finite-state models are insufficient for describing the dependencies in natural language data (Chomsky, 1956).
 The adjacency matrix of a graph exhibits the local connectivity of the nodes.
 Lack of robustness hinders the application of DNNs to critical decision making tasks such as uses in health care.
 In spite of the empirical successes, the theoretical understanding of neural networks is rather incomplete.
 For example, in computational material design, the goal is to come up with material configurations, or samples, satisfying a list of physical constraints that are given by black-box numerical Partial Differential Equations (PDE) solvers.
 Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is at the heart of climate modeling and has direct implications for understanding and predicting climate change.
 Transferring the knowledge of prior experience while solving new tasks is a key question in that setting (Lazaric, 2012; Taylor and Stone, 2009).
 For example, in recommendation systems, user queries and documents are embedded into dense vector space of the same dimensionality and MIPS is used to find the most relevant documents given a user query (Cremonesi et al., 2010).
 For example, DNNs are capable of memorizing completely random training labels but generalize poorly on clean test data (Zhang et al., 2017).
 They can be seen as one generalization of Knowledge Graphs, in which relations are defined on exactly two entities.
 These are small (imperceptible to the human eye) perturbations of an image which cause a network to misclassify the image (Biggio et al., 2013; Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014).
 The representation from deep networks is often obtained in the form of activation.
 While graph embeddings can be estimated directly by unsupervised algorithms using the graph’s structure (e.g, 24; 28; 15; 25), there is often additional (non-relational) information available for each node in the graph.
 Question asking is central to human learning yet it is a tremendous challenge for computational models.
 Early work relied on parallel corpora with a sequenceto-sequence learning framework (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Jhamtani et al., 2017).
 It represents a challenging branch of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with interesting developments in recent years (Hernandez-Leal et al., 2018).
 However, the discovery of adversarial examples, i.g,, nearly imperceptibly perturbed inputs that cause mis-classification, has revealed severe security threats, as demonstrated by attacking popular computer vision services such as Google Cloud Vision (Ilyas et al., 2018a) or Clarifai (Liu et al., 2016; Bhagoji et al., 2017b).
 Many attack generation methods have been proposed in order to find the possible minimum adversarial perturbation, commonly evaluated by its `p norm for p ∈ {0, 1, 2,∞} (Papernot et al., 2016; Carlini & Wagner, 2017; Athalye & Sutskever, 2017; Su et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018).
 Several recent network embedding methods, such as Deepwalk (Perozzi et al., 2014), Node2Vec (Grover & Leskovec, 2016) and Walklets (Perozzi et al., 2017), achieve impressive performance by learning the network structure following an approach similar to Word2Vec Skip-gram (Mikolov et al., 2013b), originally designed for word embedding.
 In particular, transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2019) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019) have been established as state-of-the-art approaches for sequence generation and language modeling respectively.
 Yet, predictive uncertainty is essential in real-world contexts tolerating minimal error margins such as autonomous vehicle control and medical, financial and legal fields.
 Because of the successes in graph neural networks, researchers have recently started to explore the use of deep generative models for graph synthesis on practical applications such as designing new chemical molecular structures (Simonovsky & Komodakis, 2018; You et al., 2018).
 These advances are due in part to the advent of algorithms capable of navigating larger action spaces and longer time horizons 2, 32, 42, as well as the distribution of data collection and training across massive-scale computing resources 42, 38, 16, 32.
 However, some well known principles in computer vision that have been shown to be effective in object detection are largely overlooked.
 Traditional TTS systems are based on multi-stage hand-engineered pipelines (Taylor, 2009).
 Given a sequence of text (usually a sentence), the objective is to identify both the named entities and the relations between them.
 Choosing a suitable neural network architecture for complex prediction tasks such as image classification and language modeling often requires a substantial effort of trial-and-error.
 The vulnerability of CNNs has spurred extensive research on adversarial attack and defense.
 The fruitful progress has been achieved on this topic, such as auto-encoder (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006) and variational auto-encoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014), generative adversarial network (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Radford et al., 2016; Arjovsky et al., 2017), normalizing flow (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015; Dinh et al., 2015; 2017; Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018), and autoregressive models (van den Oord et al., 2016b;a; 2017).
 There is a rapidly growing body of work on how to perform effective adversarial attacks, and how to defend against them (Papernot et al., 2017; Madry et al., 2017; Athalye et al., 2018).
 One reason that makes deep neural networks hard to interpret is that they are able to magically extract abstract concepts through multi-layer non-linear activations and end-toend training.
 Unlike engineered features, where one or multiple features have been designed with specific domain knowledge (SIFT (Lowe, 1999) ,SURF (Bay et al., 2008), LBP (Ojala et al., 1994), Canny (Canny, 1986), etc.), features in CNN are obtained by directly learning representations (filters) from the data without explicit domain expertise.
 Studies on adversarial examples developed attacks and defenses to assess and increase the robustness of models, respectively.
 As technology plays a larger role in daily life, the volume of available data has exploded.
 Especially, pretrained language models (Peters et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019) attract lots of attentions, which take advantage of the two-stages training process: pretraining on unlabeled corpus and then finetuning on specific tasks.
 Deep learning Super Resolution (DL-SR) algorithms (Kim et al., 2016; Lim et al., 2017; Haris et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018c;b) strive for finding the complex nonlinear mapping between low resolution (LR) images and their high resolution (HR) counterparts.
 The defining property of such models is that they provide functionality to sample from the probability density represented by the input data.
 This task is crucial for material and drug manufacturing (Corey & Wipke, 1969; Corey, 1991) and aims to predict which reactants are needed to generate a given target molecule as the main product.
 In recent years, there have been proposals of neural network architectures that are designed to implement general programs (Graves et al., 2014; Kaiser & Sutskever, 2016; Graves et al., 2016; Kurach et al., 2016), often inspired by concepts found in conventional computer systems, like pointers (Vinyals et al., 2015).
 Often times, a robot is uncertain about how the world around it evolves.
 Deep models, especially generative adversarial networks (GANs), have significantly improved the state of the art at modeling these complex distributions, thus encouraging further research (Goodfellow et al., 2014).
 Given n cities as well as the distance dij between each pair of cities i and j, the TSP aims to find a cheapest tour which starts from a beginning city (arbitrarily chosen), visits each city exactly once, and finally returns to the beginning city.
 First, since collecting real-world interaction data can be expensive and timeconsuming, algorithms must be able to learn from off-policy data no matter how it was generated, or how little correlation between the data distribution and the current policy.
 The embedding thus captures semantic relationships without discarding inter-class structure.
 ROS is an essential capability for assistant robots and could serve as the enabling step for other tasks, such as the Embodied Question Answering (Das et al., 2018a).
 LMs are powerful tools because they process a collection of unlabeled text and learn a rich embedding of natural language without supervision.
 As the energy efficiency of deep-learning inference accelerators improves, some models are now being deployed directly to edge devices to take advantage of increased privacy, reduced network bandwidth, and lower inference latency.
 The ability to automatically segment objects is important because accurate labeling is expensive and hard (Vittayakorn & Hays, 2011; Zhang et al., 2018).
 This helps other developers understand the author’s intent so that they can maintain and extend the code.
 For application domains with high cost of prediction error, such as healthcare Phan et al., (2017), it is necessary that human users can verify that a model learns reasonable representation of data and the rationale for its decisions are justifiable according to societal norms (Koh & Liang, 2017; Fong & Vedaldi, 2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Lipton, 2016; Langley, 2019).
 Logical reasoning problems span from simple propositional logic to complex predicate logic and high-order logic, with known theoretical complexities from NP-complete (Cook, 1971) to semi-decidable and undecidable (Church, 1936).
 However, successfully training deep networks to solve problems under such conditions is mystifyingly hard (Erhan et al., (2009); Larochelle et al., (2007)).
 Learning without knowledge of labels (unsupervised learning) is of increasing importance because of the abundance of unlabelled data and the rich inherent patterns they posses.
 Model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) is favored by its capability of learning complex tasks when interactions with environments are cheap.
 Despite their success, however, the recurrent structure is often troubled by two notorious issues.
 All of these possess fixed, rigid structure in space, time, or sequential ordering which are immediately amenable for further learning.
 Synaptic pruning improves efficiency by removing neurons that are redundant and strengthening synaptic connections that are useful for the environment (Rakic et al., 1994).
 However, applying it to real-world tasks remains a challenging problem, mainly due to the large search space and sparse reward signals.
 One area where machine learning has not made much of an impact is heuristics used inside combinatorial optimization algorithms such as the simplex or integer programming algorithms.
 A critical known drawback of these approaches is the vast amount of experience required to achieve good performance.
Some examples of graphical models based on a probabilistic framework with latent variables are Variational Auto-Encoders (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) (Smolensky, 1986; Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009).
 In Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) (Ho & Ermon, 2016), a discriminator network is trained to distinguish agent and expert behaviour through its observations, and is then used as a reward function.
 Boxes are packed to various bins such as shipping container and boxcar.
 This paper targets to teach the machine to recognize unseen attribute-object pairs based on seen attribute-object pairs.
 It is used in diverse tasks ranging from machine translation (Luong et al., 2015), language modeling (Liu & Lapata, 2018) to image captioning (Xu et al., 2015), and object recognition (Ba et al., 2014).
 As DNNs are applied in securitycritical systems such as malware detection, face identification, and autonomous driving, robustness of DNNs against adversarial attacks, i.g,, the intently perturbed inputs to fool the system, has become an important research topic (Szegedy et al., 2013; Papernot et al., 2016; Biggio et al., 2013).
 Though initially proposed for mainly aggregating human judgements, this idea has been successfully implemented in the context of machine learning.
 Alternatively, we aim at minimizing a black-box function in which only the oracle of function value evaluations is available,min w f(w). (1)There are growing interest in studying “gradient-free” optimization due to its applications in hyperparameter search (e.g, Bergstra et al., (2011); Koch et al., (2018)), reinforcement learning (e.g, Sehnke et al., (2010); Mania et al., (2018); Salimans et al., (2017); Choromanski et al., (2018); Vemula et al., (2019)), or black-box adversarial attacks on deep neural nets (e.g, Chen et al., (2017); Ilyas et al., (2018); Papernot et al., (2017)).
 Recently the deep Siamese network (Chopra et al., (2005)) based framework has become a standard architecture for metric learning and achieves exciting results on a wide range of applications (Wang et al., (2019)).
 It pushes forward an immense influence in agriculture, medical treatment, drug discovery and so on.
 For example, in healthcare, we may be interested in predicting how much time a patient has to live.
 In learning systems, bias can be defined as the negative consequences derived by the implicit association of patterns that occur in a high-dimensional space.
 It has applications in human activity classification, finding semantic correspondences across multiple object instances, and robot planning to name a few.
 A key question often asked of such models is “Can we trust this particular model prediction?” This question is highly relevant in high-stakes applications where the model is used to guide and inform critical decision-making — examples of such applications include: medical decision support, autonomous vehicle control, and financial forecasting (Amodei et al., (2016)).
 Powerful sequential inference algorithms have been a core research topic across many tasks that involve partial information, large search spaces, or dynamics over time.
 • S2: the location is great but the staff are surly and unhelpful .. (hard-negative)
 Bloom filters compress a given set S into bit arrays, where we can approximately test whether a given element (or query) x belongs to a set S, i.g,, x ∈ S or otherwise.
 Especially, when it is known that neural networks tend to “remember” training data instances (such as a patient’s healthcare information) (Carlini et al., 2018; Fredrikson et al., 2015; Song et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2016).
 To this end, graph neural networks (GNN) falling into either spectral-based or spatial-based approaches have been proposed.
 Various computer vision problems are solved using this framework, such as super-resolution (Ledig et al., 2017), colorization (Cao et al., 2017), denoising (Yang et al., 2018) and style transfer (Zhang et al., 2017).
 However, several test-time (Biggio et al., 2013; Szegedy et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015; Kurakin et al., 2016) and training-time (Jagielski et al., 2018; Shafahi et al., 2018) attacks have made their adoption in high-assurance applications, such as autonomous driving and security, problematic.
 Central to RL is the long-standing problem of balancing exploration and exploitation.
 Capturing long-term dependencies has especially been a major focus, with approaches ranging from explicit memorybased neural networks (Grave et al., 2016; Ke et al., 2018) to optimization improvements to stabilize learning (Le et al., 2015; Trinh et al., 2018).
 The rich information provided by different elements can complement each other to boost the performance of tasks such as face recognition, action recognition, and person re-identification (Wang et al., 2017b; Zhong et al., 2018; Girdhar et al., 2017; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014; Yang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2019a; Rao et al., 2017b).
 Despite these dramatic advances, the opacity of CNNs makes it difficult to understand why they reach particular decisions, limiting the ability to widen their application to various fields.
 The large variance associated with vanilla policy gradient estimator has prompted a series of previous works to use advantage function estimation, due to its varianceminimized form (Bhatnagar et al., 2008), to get a stable policy gradient estimation (Mnih et al., 2016; Schulman et al., 2015a;b; 2017).
 In recent years, a lot of work improved normalization methods, such as batch normalization (BN) (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015), layer normalization (LN) (Ba et al., 2016) and switchable normalization (SN) (Luo et al., 2018).
 The vehicle’s motion is composed of straight, linear dynamics and curving, nonlinear dynamics.
 In practice, label noise can arise due to a host of reasons.
 The fundamental question we aim to shed light on in this paper is:What is the right measure of similarity between two policies acting on the same underlying MDP and how can we devise algorithms to leverage this information for reinforcement learning?In simple terms, the main thesis motivating the methods we propose is that:Two policies may perform similar actions at a local level but result in very different global behaviors.
 Disease progression manifests through a broad spectrum of clinical factors, collected as a sequence of measurements over time in electronic health records (EHR), which gives a rise to complex progression patterns among patients (Samal et al., 2011).
 The remarkable deep learning revolution has been built on top of massive amounts of data (both labeled and unlabeled), and faster computation.
 Long training times are a significant bottleneck to deep learning research, as researchers typically iteratively design and test new architectures for a specific problem.
 For a given node, the graph convolution operation aggregates the embeddings (features) of its neighbors, followed by a non-linear transformation.
 In each iteration, SGD only performs one parameter update on a mini-batch of training examples.
 Moreover, the ResNet structure has also been extended to natural language processing and achieved the state-of-the-art performance (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018).
 It is defined as follows: given a video sequence and an initial annotation (commonly an axis aligned bounding box) that localizes some target object of interest, produce the object annotations corresponding to the same object for the remaining frames of the sequence.
 Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to automate architecture engineering by solving one more problem, architecture design.
 Despite the superior performance, DNN models lack meaningful explanations on how a specific decision is made, and are often regarded as blackbox classifiers.
 A trainable neural memory subsystem with such properties could be a transformative technology—pushing neural networks within grasp of tasks traditionally associated with general intelligence and an extended sequence of reasoning steps.
 Since multiple solutions exist for the mapping from LR to HR space, SISR is highly ill-posed.
 Despite of these encouraging progress, it has been shown that these models could be easily attacked by adversarial examples (Szegedy et al., 2014; Biggio et al., 2013; Carlini & Wagner, 2018; Lin et al., 2017).
 Bayesian optimization iteratively samples new point by an acquisition function, and uses Gaussian process (Rasmussen, 2003; Gardner et al., 2014) to estimate a surrogate model to fit f(x) based on the observed points.
 A ubiquitous tool at our disposal in trying to understand such systems is to posit interactions between the constituents and then simulate the resulting dynamics.
 Despite their prevalence, the adversarial nature of GANs can lead to a number of challenges, such as unstable training dynamics and mode collapse.
 However, its huge computational burden and large memory consumption still intimidate many potential applications, especially for mobile devices and embedded systems.
 Very small changes of the input image can fool the state-of-art classifier with very high success probabilities.
 Recently, graph neural networks for vertex classification and graph isomorphism test have achieved excellent results on several benchmark datasets and continuously set new state-of-the-art performance (Kipf and Welling, 2017; Veličković et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019; Klicpera et al., 2019).
 To this end, the design of effective and powerful sequential inductive biases has far-reaching benefits across many applications.
 Their performance is typically evaluated using test data, or sometimes with adversarial evaluation (Carlini & Wagner, 2017; Uesato et al., 2018; Ebrahimi et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019).
 Among the most promising approaches, Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014), auto-regressive models (van den Oord et al., 2016a;b), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) have been driving significant progress, with the latter at the forefront of a wide-range of applications (Mirza & Osindero, 2014; Reed et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018a; Vondrick et al., 2016; Almahairi et al., 2018; Subramanian et al., 2018; Salvador et al., 2019).
 However, deep networks usually require large computational resources, making them hard to deploy on mobile devices and embedded systems.
 Many physical models are idealized and do not precisely match real-world data.
 Local structure must be captured to produce high-fidelity audio, while longrange dependencies spanning tens of thousands of timesteps must be captured to generate audio which is globally consistent.
 However, current state-of-the-art RL agents equipped with deep neural networks are inherently complex, difficult and time-intensive to train.
 Though GNN frameworks are effective at fusing both the feature representations of nodes and the connectivity information, people are longing for enhancing the learning efficiency of such frameworks using limited annotated nodes.
 When these algorithms are used to make high-impact decisions such as hiring, credit-lending, predicting mortality for intensive care unit patients, or classifying benign/malign skin lesions, it is paramount to guarantee that these decisions are both accurate and unbiased with respect to sensitive attributes such as gender or ethnicity.
 Ideally, we would like to replace such cumbersome models with simpler models that perform equally well.
 This approach is primarily categorized into two types of models: discriminative model and generative model.
 Recently, region-based spatio-temporal forecasting has been extensively studied with various applications in traffic (Li et al., 2018b), ride-hailing services (Zhang et al., 2018; Li & Zheng, 2019), environment (Liang et al., 2018), resources (Li & Zheng, 2019), and human flows (Wang et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2020), among others.
 With the power of uncovering relationship behind the data and providing explanatory analyses, causality inference has drawn increasing attention in many fields, e.g, marketing, economics, and neuroscience (Pearl, 2000; Peters et al., 2017).
 The variational approach exemplified by the VAE (Kingma & Welling, 2013) has the benefit of tractable inference and uncertainty estimation while also allowing reasonable control over bottleneck representation and reconstruction quality.
 The key ingredient in enabling this is the ability to compose increasingly complex concepts out of simpler ones, and recombining and reusing concepts in novel ways (Fodor & Lepore, 2002).
 Outlier detection, the task of discovering rare or abnormal instances in a dataset, is critical for many applications from fraud detection, error identification in measurements, to fault detection in systems (2).
 As these models are deployed in more mission-critical systems, we notice that despite their incredible performance on standard metrics, they are fragile (Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014) and can be easily fooled by small perturbations to the inputs (Engstrom et al., 2017).
 Previous works show that decision process of conventional machine learning models (e.g, decision tree) can be modified to be transparent while maintaining their original performance (Si & Zhu, 2013; Letham et al., 2015).
Despite the great success in numerous applications, recent studies show that deep CNNs are vulnerable to some well-designed input samples named as Adversarial Examples (Szegedy et al., 2013; Biggio et al., 2013).
 Hence, in recent times, significant effort has been directed towards enhancing network efficiency through data augmentation, regularization methods and novel training strategies (Zhong et al., 2017) (Zhang et al., 2017), (Huang et al., 2017) (Noh et al., 2017), (Wang et al., 2018) (Han et al., 2016).
 The tracking data is often obtained from multiple experts and can exhibit very diverse styles (e.g, aggressive versus passive play in sports).
 Deep metric learning (DML) has emerged as an effective approach for learning a metric by training a deep neural network.
 Modern deep learning techniques rely heavily on extracting information form large scale datasets.
 Neural networks have shown phenomenal results in a variety of tasks in a broad range of fields such as computer vision, computational imaging, and image and language processing.
 It entails learning complex representation of real-world environment without external supervision.
 To increase the accuracy Han et al., (2015b) and Mao et al., (2017) explore training the network dense after pruning.
 CNNs’ success stems from the flexibility of the convolution operation and its adaptability to various applications with seemingly different objectives such as localization and classification.
 However, the improvement comes with the requirement of a massive amount of labeled data for each task domain to supervise the deep model.
 Their optimization yields interesting examples of a high-dimensional non-convex problem, where counter-intuitively gradient descent methods successfully converge to non-spurious minima.
 A typical example is learning on sets such as a point cloud, namely, the data are given as a set of points and permuting the points in the data does not change a result of its prediction.
 For natural spatiotemporal signals, compressive sensing provides a popular solution to this problem (Candès et al., 2006; Donoho et al., 2006).
 Many different approaches have been proposed, including LSA (Deerwester et al., 1990), SGNS (Mikolov et al., 2013a;b), GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) and others.
 Moreover, many pruning methods have been found to actually improve generalization (measured by model accuracy on previously unobserved inputs) (Narang et al., 2017; Frankle & Carbin, 2018; You et al., 2019).
 The use of amortized variational inference makes VAE scalable to deep neural networks and large amount of data.
 Invertibility is useful for training generative models with exact likelihoods (Dinh et al., 2014; 2017; Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018; Kingma et al., 2016; Behrmann et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019), increasing posterior flexibility in VAEs (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015; Tomczak & Welling, 2016; Papamakarios et al., 2017), learning transition operators in MCMC samplers (Song et al., 2017; Levy et al., 2017), computing memory-efficient gradients (Gomez et al., 2017; Donahue & Simonyan, 2019), allowing for bi-directional training (Grover et al., 2018), solving inverse problems (Ardizzone et al., 2019) and analysing adversarial robustness (Jacobsen et al., 2019).
 Nonetheless, modern deep learning models have been shown to be highly sensitive to small and adversarially crafted perturbations on the inputs (Goodfellow et al., 2015), which means a human-imperceptible changes on inputs could cause the model to make dramatically different predictions.
 With increasingly large modern datasets and automated and indirect labels like clicks, it is becoming ever more important to investigate and provide effective techniques to handle noisy labels.
 The issue of machine bias was prominently featured in ProPublica’s 2016 eponymous article (Angwin et al., 2016) where the investigation uncovered prejudice against African-Americans in COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions), a recidivism prediction tool developed by Northpointe.
 In these settings, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) agents often struggle to learn efficiently, requiring a large amount of experience collections to converge to optimal behaviors.
 Poor predictive uncertainty risks potentially poor outcomes, especially in domains such as medical diagnosis or autonomous vehicles where some forms of high confidence errors may be especially costly (Amodei et al., 2016).
 Owing to breakthroughs in deep learning, recent graph neural networks (GNNs) (Scarselli et al., 2008) have achieved considerable success on diverse graph problems by collectively aggregating information from graph structures (Wang et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018; Gao & Ji, 2019).
 However, these complex, often un-tractable models are difficult to interpret and understand.
 Various network architectures have been proposed to further boost classification performance since then, including VGGNet (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015), GoogleNet (Szegedy et al., 2015), ResNet (He et al., 2016), DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017) and SENet (Hu et al., 2018), etc.
 So, studying what “information” they contain seems like a natural starting point to understand how deep networks learn.
 Despite these successes, many properties of Q-learning are poorly understood, and it is challenging to successfully apply deep Q-learning in practice.
 Due to the remarkable capability to learn semantic-rich features, deep neural networks have been becoming one widely-used technique to empower a broad range of machine learning tasks.
5 million people worldwide contract sepsis.
 Therefore, evaluating the robustness of a given model becomes crucial for security sensitive applications.
 However, their success highly counts on the availability of well-annotated and big data, which is barely available for real-world applications.
 Application areas include land-use land-cover analysis, urban planning, and natural disaster detection.
 With the rapid development of deep learning, RL agents parametrized by neural networks, usually referred to as deep RL agents, are able to learn complex policies from raw inputs (Mnih et al., 2015).
 While deep generative models such as Boltzmann machines Salakhutdinov & Hinton (2009) and auto-encoding variational Bayes Kingma & Welling (2013) accomplish this task to some extent, they are inadequate for many intractable probabilistic computations that arise in maximum likelihood estimation.
 Consider the middle illustration in Figure 1, where a robot has four ‘options’, each representing a goal shape it can potentially reach.
 This has resulted in deployment of these models in real life applications where safety is paramount (e.g, autonomous driving).
 Inspired by these learning mechanisms, Imitation Learning (IL) has long been a popular method for training autonomous agents from human-provided demonstrations.
 Due to its off-policy update, Q-learning can leverage transitions collected by any policy which makes it more data-efficient compared to onpolicy methods.
 These methods leverage an offline meta-training phase, in which they use data from a distribution of tasks to optimize learning performance on new tasks.
 Despite these achievements, many recent RL techniques still suffer from poor sample efficiency.
 Yet, they lack robustness to various forms of distribution shift that typically occur in real-world settings.
 Recently a number of new off-policy Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms have been proposed for control tasks with continuous state and action spaces, including Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) (Lillicrap et al., 2015; Fujimoto et al., 2018).
 Building these tickets is typically achieved by pruning the weights with lowest magnitude of an over-parametrized network that has been trained to convergence, before resetting the remaining weights to their initial values, or at some point early in training, and repeating the procedure.
 Overall, the generative models fall into four categories: autoencoder and its most important variant of Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2013), auto-regressive models (van den Oord et al., 2016b;a), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014), and normalizing flows (NF) (Tabak & Vanden-Eijnden, 2010; Tabak & Turner, 2013; Rezende & Mohamed, 2015).
 Nevertheless, deep complex-valued models have only started to gain momentum (Reichert & Serre, 2014; Arjovsky et al., 2015; Danihelka et al., 2016; Trabelsi et al., 2017; Jose et al., 2017; Wolter & Yao, 2018b; Choi et al., 2019), with the great majority of models in deep learning still relying on real-valued representations.
 Modern networks are comprised of millions of parameters, requiring significant storage and computational effort.
 For example, MCB (Fukui et al., 2017), BAN (Kim et al., 2018), DFAF (Gao et al., 2019) proposed advanced multimodal fusion methods for Visual Question Answering (VQA) (Antol et al., 2015).
 It has been applied to many diverse domains such as high-dimensional statistics (Bühlmann & Van De Geer, 2011), signal processing (Lai et al., 2013), and computer vision (Wright et al., 2008).
 Yet despite this, there lacks a quantitative measure of intelligence in these agents.
 In medicine, differential equations may be used to model cancer growth (Ilea et al., 2013), diabetes and the glucose metabolism (Esna-Ashari et al., 2017) as well as for pharmaceutical drug design (Deuflhard, 2000).
 Both the research community and general public are becoming increasingly aware that there is a variety of scenarios where this kind of data collection comes with significant risks, mainly related to notions of privacy and trust.
 This study also treats over-parameterized two-layer neural networks using smooth activation functions and analyzes the convergence and generalization abilities of the gradient descent method for optimizing this type of network.
 The original GAN minimizes the loss φ(pg, pdata) = maxD hD(pg, pdata), where hD is a binary classification loss that depends on the discriminator D.
 Using reinforcement learning (RL) to derive agent policies becomes challenging since the environment becomes non-stationary for each agent when its peers adapt their behaviour through their learning process.
 There is ample evidence that relational representations are important for human cognition (e.g, (Goldin-Meadow & Gentner, 2003; Forbus et al., 2017; Crouse et al., 2018; Chen & Forbus, 2018; Chen et al., 2019)).
 However, the generated sentences are still poor in semantics or global coherence, even not perfect grammatically speaking (Caccia et al., 2019).
 It structurally describes images, which provides rich semantic information of an image to many applications including visual question answering (VQA) (Li et al., 2018), image captioning (Yang et al., 2019) and image retrieval (Johnson et al., 2015).
 An information-theoretic quantification of how much observing the past can help in predicting the future is given by the predictive information (Bialek et al., 2001).
 A prominent application example is that of molecules, for which both inference based on the chemical compound, i.g,, the molecular graph structure (Kearnes et al., 2016; Janet & Kulik, 2017; Winter et al., 2019a), and based on the geometry, i.g,the positions of atoms in 3D space (Behler & Parrinello, 2007; Rupp et al., 2012; Schütt et al., 2017a; Smith et al., 2017) are active areas of research.
 These methods operate using graph representations of molecules in which nodes and edges represent atoms and bonds, respectively.
 One of these issues is that data are often incomplete.
 Their data-hungry nature limits their applicability to real-world scenarios, where the cost of annotating examples is prohibitive, or they involve rare concepts (Zhu et al., 2014; Fink, 2011).
 Many attack methods have been developed to find imperceptible perturbations to fool the target classifiers (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016; Carlini & Wagner, 2017; Brendel et al., 2017).
 Such problems also arise in various applied fields, e.g, sociology (Harary & Ross, 1957), operations research (Feo et al., 1994) and bioinformatics (Gardiner et al., 2000).
 AI agents have been outperforming humans in an increasing variety of tasks, such as in recognizing images on ImageNet (He et al., 2016) and in the ancient game of Go (Silver et al., 2016).
 Example data sources include mobile network antennas that serve the traffic generated by ubiquitous mobile services at city scale (Zhang et al., 2019b), sensors that monitor the air quality of a target region (Cheng et al., 2018), or moving crowds that produce individual trajectories.
 GANs were originally proposed and demonstrated for images by Goodfellow et al., (2014).
 What if we could instead design an unsupervised RL algorithm that automatically explores the environment and iteratively distills this experience into general-purpose policies that can accomplish new user-specified tasks at test time? For an agent to learn autonomously, it needs an explo-ration objective.
 The aim of unsupervised representation learning research is to find a representation z of the generative factor o living in a known space Z describing, as well as o, the visible data x.
 However, adversarial training also causes an undesirable increase in the error on the unperturbed images (test error).
 However, the design of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms requires many decisions, normally involving human time and expertise.
 However, these performance improvements require a higher number of parameters and greater computational complexity.
 Smoothly varying features such as the size or the pose of an animal introduce smooth manifold structure, while the existence of discrete features such as species makes the structure not a single manifold but multiple disconnected manifolds (e.g, one manifold per species) (Khayatkhoei et al., 2018).
 Being able to quickly learn new classes from a small number of labeled examples is desirable from a practical perspective because it removes the need to label large datasets.
 In complex real world environments, the future is highly uncertain.
 In such high stakes applications, explaining the model outcome is crucial to build trust among end–users.
 Specifically, deep neural networks can be thought of as linear classifiers acting on learned feature representations (also known as feature embeddings).
 Automatic model design of neural network architectures without human intervention, known as neural architecture search (NAS), has drawn much attention of the community recently.
 Demonstration data has been shown to be helpful for tackling hard-exploration problems (Subramanian et al., 2016); many existing methods (Hester et al., 2018; Pohlen et al., 2018; Aytar et al., 2018; Salimans & Chen, 2018) provide the guidance for exploration based on imitation learning of expert demonstrations and achieve strong performances on hard-exploration tasks.
 Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) Kipf & Welling (2017) was recently proposed as an adaptation of a particular deep learning model (i.g,, convolutional neural networks Lecun et al., (1998)) to enable handling graph-structured data.
 Yet, despite consensus about the benefits of a closer integration of deep learning and neuroscience (Bengio et al., 2015; Marblestone et al., 2016), important differences remain.
 However, for more complex problems with larger state and action spaces or sparse reward settings, traditional DRL methods hardly works.
 One approach to capture this ability is via model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) (Munro, 1987; Werbos, 1987; Nguyen & Widrow, 1990; Schmidhuber, 1991).
 Continual learning (Ring, 1994), also known as lifelong learning (Thrun, 1994), is a specific research field in AI that focuses on avoiding or alleviating catastrophic forgetting.
 Novak et al., (2019); Garriga-Alonso et al., (2019) also implemented CNN-GP and tested its empirical performance.
 However, there ubiquitously exists a type of task, which we call objective-constrained task, that is quite important but has not yet been well settled.
 However, ML models may unintentionally reveal sensitive aspects of their training data, e.g, due to overfitting (Shokri et al., 2017; Song & Shmatikov, 2019).
 However, CNNs are compute and memory intensive; even a moderately sized CNN model, like ResNet-50 with tens of millions of parameters, requires billions of floating-point operations and consumes tens of gigabytes to store weights and activations during training.
 Unfortunately, their vast demands for computational resources often prevents their use on power-challenged platforms.
 Nowadays, companies spend tremendous efforts and expense collecting data to build their products.
 These successes showcase the power of learning from direct interactions with environments.
 However, outstanding neural networks usually require deeper and/or wider layers, thus making them hard to deploy on mobile and embedded devices.
 However, a line of recent research has shown that deep learning algorithms are susceptible to privacy attacks that leak information about the training dataset (Fredrikson et al., 2015; Rahman et al., 2018; Song & Shmatikov, 2018; Hayes et al., 2017).
 Learning from small datasets of multiple tasks (i.g,, multiple stochastic processes), NP can be seen as a probabilistic latent variable framework for meta-learning.
 These situations often arise in practical computer vision problems where large quantities of images are readily available and generating ground truth labels acts as a bottleneck due to the cost and labour required.
 For example, let ξi = (ai, yi), where ai denotes the feature of the ith training data and yi denotes the label.
 This lack of tractable models prevents us from analysing the impact of data sets on the training of neural networks and their ability to generalise from examples, which remains an open problem both in statistical learning theory (Vapnik, 2013; Mohri et al., 2012), and in analysing the average-case behaviour of algorithms in synthetic data models (Seung et al., 1992; Engel & Van den Broeck, 2001; Zdeborova\\u0301 & Krzakala, 2016).
 A number of papers propose simple scaling rules that predict how changing the learning rate and batch size will influence the final performance of popular network architectures (Hoffer et al., 2017; Goyal et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2017; Jastrzębski et al., 2017).
 Information is being created, stored and sent at rates never before seen.
 Each step must be so small that it can always be taken, yet in taking it the student moves somewhat closer to fully competent behavior”.
A number of important applications, however, require to generate objects that are both credible and feasible with respect to hard structural constraints.
 However, GANs do not explicitly estimate the data likelihood.
 While deep neural networks (DNNs) have successfully tackled complex real-world problems in various domains including vision, speech and language (Schmidhuber, 2015; LeCun et al., 2015; Goodfellow et al., 2016), they still face significant limitations that make them unfit for safety-critical applications (Amodei et al., 2016).
 Learning with graphs has recently drawn much attention as neural network approaches to representation learning have been proven to be effective for complex data structures (Niepert et al., 2016; Kipf & Welling, 2017; Hamilton et al., 2017b; Schlichtkrull et al., 2018; Velickovic et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019).
 Szegedy et al., (2014) discovered that neural networks are vulnerable to what they termed adversarial inputs: by adding carefully-chosen perturbations to correctly-classified inputs, the accuracy of any neural network could be almost arbitrarily decreased.
 Feature selection leads to a number of potential benefits: reducing experimental costs Min et al., (2014), enhancing interpretability (Ribeiro et al., 2016), computational speed up and even improving model generalization on unseen data (Chandrashekar & Sahin, 2014).
 The standard way to learn these continuous representations involves: 1) defining the vocabulary V = {e1, ..., e∣V ∣} as the set of all objects, and 2) learning a ∣V ∣ × d embedding matrix that defines a d dimensional continuous representation for each object.
 Recent advance in deep learning has also enabled the application of Q-learning algorithms to large-scale decision problems such as mastering Go (Silver et al., 2016; 2017), robotic motion control (Levine et al., 2015; Kalashnikov et al., 2018) and autonomous driving (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2016; Schwarting et al., 2018).
 Assume we have a parametric model p(y|x,θ) for the conditional distribution where θ denotes weights and biases of a neural network, and p(θ) is a prior distribution over parameters.
 Compared with more direct optimization methods such as gradient descent or second-order optimization, DRL naturally incorporates exploration into its planning, allowing it to learn generalizable policies and robust state value estimations across simulated environments.
 Thus, having effective RL approaches that can utilize pixels as input would potentially enable solutions for a wide range of real world problems.
 These attacks corrupt the input with a small and usually imperceptible structured noise causing the model to output incorrect predictions.
 Guaranteeing competitive performance, the federated learning permits each learner to compute their local updates of each round for relatively many iterations (e.g, 1 epoch, 10 epochs, etc.), which provides much higher communication-efficiency compared to the conventional data parallelism approaches (for intra-datacenter environments, e.g, Dean et al., (2012); Chen et al., (2016)) that generally require very frequent gradient aggregation.
 State-of-the-art DNN models are typically overparameterized and contain more parameters than the size of the training dataset.
 Unsurprisingly, much effort has been devoted to adopting the GAN framework for unsupervised text generation (Yu et al., 2017; Che et al., 2017; Balagopalan et al., 2018; Fedus et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2018; de Masson d’Autume et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017; Nie et al., 2019).
 For example, multiple political candidates may engage in costly political campaigns, but only one candidate wins; though only the winner is rewarded, other candidates cannot recover their expenditure.
 Deep learning approaches play an increasingly important role and have become state-of-the-art in various segmentation tasks (Huang et al., 2018; Khoreva et al., 2017; Tsutsui et al., 2018; Ghosh et al., 2018; Litjens et al., 2017).
 DeepXML is demonstrated to be significantly more accurate and an order of magnitude faster to train than state-of-the-art deep extreme classifiers XML-CNN (Liu et al., 2017) and AttentionXML (You et al., 2018).
 One class of such systems are intelligent editors that identify and correct errors in documents while they are written.
 However batch normalization also has a number of limitations.
 Time series analysis has become increasingly important in monitoring systems health and performance.
 A big weakness of these neural networks is the reliance on abundant labeled datasets.
 When inputs are determined to be out of distribution, the output of an ML algorithm should not be trusted.
 Formally speaking, anomaly detection problems can be statistically viewed as identifying outliers having low probabilities from the modelling of data distribution p(x).
 Exploration plays an important role in solving a given sequential decision-making problem.
 Specifically, we consider the problem of reconstructing a sequence of signals st ∈ Rn0 , t = 1, 2, . , T , from low-dimensional measurements xt = Ast, where A ∈ Rn×n0 (n n0) is a sensing matrix.
 Structured factors, such as scale, admit clear theories and efficient representation design.
 The standard active learning scenario focuses on training a model on few labeled examples alone, while unlabeled data are only used for acquisition, i.g,, performing inference and selecting a subset for annotation.
 However, these advances have also come with a plethora of design decisions: should we choose a CNN-based (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Kim, 2014), RNN-based (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014) or Transformer-based (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2018) architecture? What variety of pre-training method should we use (Le & Mikolov, 2014; Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Akbik et al., 2018)? The proliferation of model variants pose a great challenge for current evaluation methodology, which are usually opaque and simply give a single holistic score (Papineni et al., 2002; Banerjee & Lavie, 2005; Popović & Ney, 2011).
 With the development of city, new transportation demands have led to the expansion of metro network.
 Human voice mimicry has always been considered as one of the most difficult tasks since it involves understanding of the sophisticated human speech production mechanism (Eriksson & Wretling (1997)) and challenging concepts of prosodic transfer (Gomathi et al., (2012)).
The resolution of an optimization problem is usually tackled using an optimization algorithm that produces a sequence of iterates converging to some minimizer of f (Nesterov (2018)).
 What embedding functions have in common is that they map their input into a fixed-length distributed representation (i.g,, continuous space) that facilitates more efficient and accurate (Scott et al., 2018) downstream analysis than simplistic representations such as one-of-k.
 Nevertheless, it is difficult to do this in the real world because the number of existing classes is enormous.
 However, excellent performance comes at the cost of significantly high computational and memory complexity, typically requiring teraops of computation during inference and Gigabytes of storage.
 A plethora of work has investigated scaling deep learning from a compute- or network-bound perspective (e.g, Dean et al., 2012; Cui et al., 2016; Abadi et al., 2015; Cui et al., 2014; Jouppi et al., 2017; Lim et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2018; Alistarh et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2017; Wangni et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017).
 (1)HereX stands for the unknown matrix,M ∈ Rm×n for the ground truth matrix, S is a binary mask representing the input support, and denotes the Hadamard product.
 It is important that an autonomous systems make reliable classifications even with noisy data.
 They have been applied to various tasks, such as processing graph nodes (Murphy et al., 2018), hypergraphs (Maron et al., 2019), 3D image reconstruction (Yang et al., 2019), and point cloud classification and image tagging (Zaheer et al., 2017).
 Student A studies by diligently learning the class material by heart.
 For instance, a movie recommendation system may optimize not only the likelihood of the user clicking on a suggested movie, but also the likelihood that the user is going to watch it.
 In particular, the mathematical and representational models for V1 are still in short supply.
 There are many diverse and complex artistic domains with various styles such as watercolor, oil painting, sketching, and so on.
 AD applications are common in various domains that involve different data types, including medical diagnosis (Prastawa et al., 2004), cybersecurity (Garcia-Teodoro et al., 2009) and quality control in industrial manufacturing (Scime & Beuth, 2018).
 Sequence-level tasks map a sequence of observations x0:T to a single label y.
 Relying on the richness of contents, several sentence embeddings have been proposed (Peters et al., (2018); Radford et al., (2018); Devlin et al., (2018)) with demonstrated efficiency for the considered tasks.
 A common task is to impute missing events, e.g, to predict the future from the past.
 So far, certification of their behavior has remained predominantly focused on uniform classification of norm-bounded balls (Gehr et al., 2018; Katz et al., 2017; Wong et al., 2018; Gowal et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2018; Raghunathan et al., 2018; Tjeng et al., 2017; Dvijotham et al., 2018b; Salman et al., 2019; Dvijotham et al., 2018c; Wang et al., 2018), which aim to capture invisible perturbations.
 One common solution to this problem is to use distributed systems for training.
 Historically, the rampant success of deep learning models has lacked a sturdy theoretical foundation; architectures, hyperparameters, and learning algorithms are more often than not selected by brute force search Bergstra & Bengio (2012) and heuristics Glorot & Bengio (2010).
 The generic class representations, which we refer to as ‘templates’, express how samples from a class relate to other classes on average and can be used to efficiently determine class membership.
 As an example, a generative model for music should be able to memorize long sequences of notes and be able to repeat them, as it is typically done in musical pieces.
 The popularity of DNNs in production-ready systems has raised a serious security concern as DNNs are found to be susceptible to a wide range of adversarial attacks (Madry et al., 2017; Akhtar & Mian, 2018; Dong et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2017; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Kurakin et al., 2016), where small and imperceptible perturbations of the input data lead to incorrect predictions by the networks.
 These models learn sophisticated feature representations of a graph and its constituents (i.g,, nodes and edges) through layers of feature transformation.
 For example, people tend to focus on the most relevant segments to search for the answers to their questions in mind during reading.
 One fundamental set of theoretical questions concerning deep networks relates to their expressivity.
 Examples include image super-resolution (Dong et al., 2014), denoising (Xie et al., 2012), deblurring (Eigen et al., 2013), colorization (Zhang et al., 2016) and style transfer (Gatys et al., 2015).
 The problem occurs in many different settings and for different types of sequences.
 It has been demonstrated that ensembles of models improve predictive performance and offer higher quality uncertainty quantification (Dietterich, 2000; Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017; Ovadia et al., 2019).
 In recent years, neural autoregressive models have shown superiority on various natural language generation (NLG) tasks (Zhang & Lapata, 2014; Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Du et al., 2017; Fiorini & Lu, 2018).
 While the former offers good asymptotic performance, it suffers from poor sample complexity.
 However, recent research found that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples which are carefully crafted instances aiming to induce arbitrary prediction errors for learning systems.
 Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a well-known simulation-based method, which promises asymptotically unbiased samples from arbitrary distributions at the cost of expensive Markov simulations.
 Each language can be thought of as a transformation that maps an underlying concept into a view that we collectively agree is determined as ‘English’ or ‘French’.
 GNNs can obtain informative node representations for a graph of arbitrary size and attributes, and has shown great effectiveness in graph-related down-stream applications, such as node classification (Kipf & Welling, 2017), graph classification (Wu et al., 2019b), graph matching (Bai et al., 2019), recommendation systems (Ying et al., 2018), and knowledge graphs (Schlichtkrull et al., 2018).
 A popular means for visually explaining an image classifier’s decisions is an attribution map i.g,a heatmap that highlights the input pixels that are the evidence for and against the classification outputs (Montavon et al., 2018).
 The learned model can be thought as function y = F (x) that gives a prediction y ∈ Rdy given input x ∈ Rdx where dy and dx are dimensions of the output and input respectively.
 The type of an atom eventually defines the respective chemical elements, while structural bonding between atoms yields molecules (the building blocks of matter and our universe).
 We would like the robot to notice its owners preference for having coffee in the morning, but we would not want the robot to prevent its owner from sleeping late just because the robot is unsure if the owner will still want coffee if they wake up in the afternoon.
 However, when the original categorical features have high cardinalities, such data becomes high-dimensional and sparse.
 Despite their recent successes, however, one of the key constraints of them is the requirement of dense reward signals.
 Recent work has sought to better reason about videos by learning more effective spatio-temporal representations (Tran et al., 2015; Carreira & Zisserman, 2017).
 In contrast, humans and animals can quickly learn about new classes of objects from few examples (Landau et al., 1988; Markman, 1989).
 Simulating crystal systems in particular provides useful properties such as surface absorption, chemical reactions, and surface magnetism (Bilek & Skála, 1978).
 Other fields have developed methods to ensure privacy (Al-Rubaie & Chang, 2019; Papernot et al., 2016), however, such work do not offer protection against policy cloning.
 Many models have been developed for learning representations of entities and relations in knowledge graphs, such that known facts can be recalled and previously unknown facts can be inferred, a task known as link prediction.
 Not only do advanced network architecture designs and better optimization techniques contribute to the success, but the availability of large annotated datasets (e.g, ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), MS COCO (Lin et al., 2014), Cityscapes (Cordts et al., 2016)) also plays an important role.
 To further ensure the safety in control, applying constraints over states and actions is a natural way.
 Algorithmic innovations such as large batch training (Keskar et al., 2016) and neural architecture search (Zoph & Le, 2016) have enabled models to scale on large compute cluster to accelerate training.
 The benefits of using ES in Reinforcement Learning (RL) were exhibited in (4).
 The relation of individual parameters to the network’s output is highly nonlinear and is generally unclear to an external observer.
 Programming such policies is a labor and time-consuming process which requires substantial technical expertise.
 Learning the sparse representation of signals or data plays an important role in many applications, such as image restoration (Liu et al., 2018; 2019b), classification (Wright et al., 2009), radar detection (Ahmad & Amin, 2013), medical imaging (Lustig et al., 2007), or black hole image in astronomy (Honma et al., 2016).
 Encouraged by their huge success, GNNs have widely been used in a variety of domain specific applications such as machine reading comprehension (Chen et al., 2019a), semantic parsing (Xu et al., 2018b), natural language generation (Chen et al., 2019b), and healthcare informatics (Gao et al., 2019).
 Due to the huge overhead in labeling large-scale training data, it is desirable if an existing network can be adapted to different target domains.
 Wide adoption of these networks in consumer devices poses a threat to their safety when exposed to a malicious adversary.
 Over the last few years there has been substantial interest in finding adversarial examples (Carlini & Wagner, 2017), empirically (Madry et al., 2018) and provably (Wong & Kolter, 2018; Mirman et al., 2018) defending against them as well as proving the neural network is robust to these (Gehr et al., 2018).
 Since the prediction can not be perfect and the misprediction might result in fatal consequences in areas such as medical analysis and autonomous vehicles control, estimating uncertainty as well as predictions will be crucial for the safer application of machine learning based systems.
 A large number of numerical (Dauphin et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Li et al., 2018; Sagun et al., 2014; 2016; Ballard et al., 2017; Garipov et al., 2018; Draxler et al., 2018; Sagun et al., 2017; Baity-Jesi et al., 2018) and theoretical (Choromanska et al., 2015; Rasmussen, 2003; Freeman and Bruna, 2016; Soudry and Carmon, 2016; Nguyen and Hein, 2017) studies have explored the properties of the loss landscape.
 Through a mass of studies (Neyshabur et al., 2017; Canziani et al., 2016; Novak et al., 2018), researchers have proved that a DNN with larger capacity will have a better generalizability, which leads to a better performance.
 While they are known to be robust to random noise, it has been shown that the accuracy of deep nets dramatically deteriorates in the face of so-called adversarial examples (Biggio et al., 2013; Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014), i.g,small perturbations of the input signal, often imperceptible to humans, that are sufficient to induce large changes in the model output.
 GANs and their variants have been successfully applied to numerous datasets and tasks, including image-to-image translation (Isola et al., 2017), image super-resolution (Ledig et al., 2017), domain adaptation (Tzeng et al., 2017), probabilistic inference (Dumoulin et al., 2016), compressed sensing (Bora et al., 2017) and many more.
 Though they have been shown to be powerful in modeling large text corpora, the topic modeling (TM) still remains challenging especially in the sparse-data setting, especially for the cases where word co-occurrence data is insufficient e.g, on short text or a corpus of few documents.
 Perhaps the most widely recognized regularization methods in deep learning are L2 regularization (also known as weight decay) and dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014).
 Semantic segmentation studies the tasks of assigning a class label to each pixel of an image, while instance segmentation (Chen et al., 2018a) detects and segment each object instance.
 The catastrophic forgetting problem occurs when we want to learn several tasks sequentially without any continual learning (CL) technique (Ratcliff (1990); French (1999); Goodfellow et al., (2013)).
 Nevertheless, for the majority of real applications, there is no reward in a long term until the agent reaches a goal state (Wu & Chen (2007)), especially in unseen environments.
 For example, many symbolic mathematical software packages fail to solve nn n = 1010 10 for n.
 Fluids are commonly modelled by numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equations, however computer generated solutions might be discrepant from real phenomena.
 The most successful and widely-used recipe for deep neural network is ReLU-style activation function with MSRA style weight initialization (He et al., 2015).
 More interestingly, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; 2018), and language inference (Bowman et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2017), without substantial task-specific architecture modifications.
 Thus, one of the grand challenges in machine learning has been to make deep learning embrace the benefits of symbolic representation so that symbolic entities can emerge from high-dimensional observations such as visual scenes.
 However, training deep neural networks may take days or even weeks to converge.
 The most common models are composed of an encoder that reads the entire input sequence, while a decoder (often equipped with an attention mechanism) iteratively produces the next output token given the input and the partial output decoded so far.
 In the original formulation, the two players are playing a zero-sum game with the loss function of the generator given by the binary cross entropy,min G max D1 2 Ex∼Pdata logD(x) + 1 2 Ex∼G log (1−D(x)) .
 Despite their success, the internal mechanism of DNNs is still a black box.
 Yet, recent (hierarchical) relation network based forward dynamics predictors (Battaglia et al., 2016; Chang et al., 2016; Mrowca et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019) seem to be a promising alternative to conventional physics engines that are key components of robot control, computer vision and reinforcement learning (RL) systems.
 Commonly seen attributed graphs include citation networks where each node is a document represented by a bag-of-words feature vector and edges are citation links, web graphs where each webpage is also represented as a vector of words and edges are hyperlinks, social networks where each user is represented by a user profile vector and edges indicate user friendship, and protein-protein interaction networks where each protein is represented by a list of protein signatures and edges encode interactions between proteins.
 This rapid adaptation increasingly questions the machine learning model\\u2019s credibility, fairness, and more generally interpretability.
 Their capability is demonstrated in many data sets of natural images.
 While a plethora of work demonstrates the effectiveness of deep generative models in this regard, recent work of Nalisnick et al., (2019a) and Choi et al., (2018) show that these models often fail even at a task that is supposed to be close to their original goal of learning densities.
 The current state-of-the-art deep agents can learn and retain knowledge well when trained on individual tasks but their performance on previously learned tasks abruptly degrades when trained for one or more new tasks.
 We beg to differ.
 Self-supervised neural sequence models for text trained with a language modeling objective, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), and RoBERTA (Liu et al., 2019b), were shown to produce representations that excel in recovering both structure-related information (Gulordava et al., 2018; van Schijndel & Linzen; Wilcox et al., 2018; Goldberg, 2019) as well as in semantic information (Yang et al., 2019; Joshi et al., 2019).
 It has been shown that over-parameterized neural networks can fit complicated target function or even randomly labeled data (Zhang et al., 2016) and still exhibit good generalization performance when trained with real labels.
 Computing exact gradient over the entire training set is intractable for these problems.
 The benefit of using these models as opposed to hand-crafted methods is that they can adapt to the statistics of their inputs much better, and hence allow significant gains in compression rate at a given quality setting, and in quality at a given compression rate.
 The expressive power of these networks has been demonstrated both in theory and practice (Cybenko, 1989; Barron, 1994; Telgarsky, 2015; Yarotsky, 2017; Hanin & Sellke, 2017; Daubechies et al., 2019).
 A key challenge in RL is to balance the relationship between exploration and exploitation.
 But since you have never been in their kitchen before, there could be certain tools you have never seen, like an odd-shaped sponge.
 In these problems heteroscedastic or input-dependent noise is rarely accounted for and the assumption of homoscedastic noise is often inappropriate.
 In particular, geometric deep learning is an emerging direction in machine learning which aims at generalizing the concepts of deep learning for data in non-Euclidean spaces, e.g, graphs and manifolds, by bridging the gap between graph theory and deep neural networks (see discussion by Bronstein et al., 2017; Monti et al., 2017; Monti, 2019, and references therein).
 However, providing quality labels to each of the samples collected within these large datasets is a long and expensive process.
 Such algorithms are often model-free, i.g,they do not learn or exploit knowledge of the environment’s dynamics.
 While there are a lot of successful attacks proposed in the continuous data domain including images, audios, and videos, how to effectively generate adversarial examples in the discrete text domain still remains a hard problem.
 While these models empirically generalize well when placed into new test enviornments, they are often easily fooled by adversarial perturbations (Goodfellow et al., 2014), and have difficulty understanding when their predictions should not be trusted.
 Dithering strategies like epsilon-greedy, Gaussian action noise, and Boltzmann exploration are inefficient and require exponential interactions to explore the whole state space.
 However, the problem of variational inference in VAE is still challenging, especially for high-dimensional data like images.
 Over the last few years, different types of multi-task learning mechanisms (Sener & Koltun, 2018; Guo & Farooq, 2018; Ish, 2016; Lon, 2015) have been proposed and proved better than single-task learning methods from natural language processing (Palmer et al., 2017) and computer vision (Cortes et al., 2015) to chemical study (Ramsundar et al., 2015).
 This shift in data distributions, known as domain shift, is a core reason which hinders the generalizability of predictive models to new domains.
 In Natural Language Processing (NLP), which operates on discrete symbol sequences, adversarial attacks can take a variety of forms (Ettinger et al., 2017; Alzantot et al., 2018) including character perturbations (Ebrahimi et al., 2018), semantically invariant reformulations (Ribeiro et al., 2018b; Iyyer et al., 2018b) or—specifically in Reading Comprehension (RC)—adversarial text insertions (Jia & Liang, 2017; Wang & Bansal, 2018).
 Yet it is more difficult to apply supervised NLP methods, like text classification, in these domains than it is for more general language.
 Some proteins with similar sequences play similar roles; others with high levels of sequence similarity can play different roles.
 This motivates the development of cross-lingual methods that can perform knowledge transfer from sentence representations in one language to labels assigned to sentences in another language.
 BO has been successfully applied to diverse applications, ranging from automated machine learning (Snoek et al., 2012; Hutter et al., 2011) to robotics (Lizotte et al., 2007; Calandra et al., 2015; Rai et al., 2018).
 This causes non-convex loss landscape with proliferation of saddle-points and poorly-conditioned curvature where gradient-based first order optimization methods perform poorly (Martens, 2010; Dauphin et al., 2014).
 ICD codes are used for a wide range of purposes including billing, reimbursement, and retrieving of diagnostic information.
 The irregular-sampling may result both from the characteristics of the sensors and sampling strategy, e.g, considered orbits and swaths in spacebone earth observation and astrophysics, sampling schemes in medical imaging, as well as environmental conditions which may affect the sensor, e.g, atmospheric conditions and clouds for earth observation.
 In recent years, there has been substantial progress in high accuracy image segmentation in the high data regime (see Liu et al., (2019) and their references).
 Thus, there is a growing interest to develop optimization solutions to tackle this critical issue.
 Both these alternatives typically introduce noisy (wrong) labels.
Conventional methods (Mostow & Chen, 2009; Heilman & Smith, 2010; Heilman, 2011) for QG rely on heuristic rules or hand-crafted templates, leading to the issues of low generalizability and scalability.
 This translates into an effective way of learning multiple tasks at the same time, but it can also improve the learning of each individual task compared to learning them separately (Caruana, 1997).
 Various policy gradient methods have been used, notably REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) and variants thereof (e.g, Ranzato et al., 2015; Edunov et al., 2018) and Minimum Risk Training (MRT; e.g, Och, 2003; Shen et al., 2016).
 However, graph classification tasks also require learning good graph-level representations.
 This problem is called Lawler’s QAP (Lawler, 1963) and has attracted enormous attention for its generally NP-complete (Hartmanis, 1982) challenge, as well as a wide spectrum of applications in computer vision, graphics, machine learning and operational research etc.
 Among these, semi-supervised node classification on graphs is one of the most interesting also popular topics.
 The agent does not observe a reward signal or query the expert, and does not know the state transition dynamics.
While the superiority of deep architectures in these domains is undoubtful, machine learning for tabular data still did not fully benefit from the DNN power.
 All the datasets require time-consuming annotations and are keys for re-ID performance improvements.
 However, these methods still require some annotations for each of the classes that one wishes to learn.
 On each step, the agent updates its action value estimates towards the observed reward and the estimated value of the maximal action in the next state.
 Federated Learning (FL) (Mohassel & Rindal, 2018; Bonawitz et al., 2017; Mohassel & Zhang, 2017) provides a privacy-preserving mechanism to leverage such decen-tralized data and computation resources to train machine learning models.
 While large models are required to do better on hard examples, small models are likely to perform as well on easy ones, e.g, the aforementioned ensemble is probably not required to translate a short phrase such as "Thank you".
 Thus, model compression techniques, especially pruning methods that increase the sparsity of weight matrices, have been extensively studied to reduce the memory consumption and computation cost of DNNs (Han et al., 2015b;a; Wen et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2016; Louizos et al., 2017b; Luo et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2015).
In the literature, NAS algorithms are typically compared based on their results in the evaluation phase.
 In many safety-critical applications, it is important to consider a diverse set of possible future trajectories, even those that are less likely, so that necessary preemptive actions can be taken.
 The training loss f is assumed to be smooth (but nonconvex) with respect to x, the regularization r is assumed to be convex (but nonsmooth), proper and lower semicontinuous, and the constraint set X is convex and compact (closed and bounded).
 When a stream of tasks are joined to be trained sequentially, isolated learning faces catastrophic forgetting (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989) due to a non-stationary data distribution that biases the model (left figure of Figure 1).
 For instance, in the example of taxi fleets (Miao et al., 2016), drivers may prefer to stay in the area with high customer demand to gain more reward.
 Existing works can be roughly divided into two categories, depending on whether convolution is applied to the spectral or spatial domain.
 To prevent these from happening, it is strongly desired for a DNN to output confidence estimations on its decisions.
 Compared with other diversity-oriented techniques (e.g, entropy (Zadeh et al., 2017) and orthogonality (Zhang et al., 2017)), DPP shows its superiority as it incorporates only one single metric and delivers genuine diversity on any bounded space (Kulesza et al., 2012; Affandi et al., 2013; Gillenwater et al., 2012).
 As such, it has a considerable financial impact, often ranging in the millions of dollars for every point of forecasting accuracy gained (Jain, 2017; Kahn, 2003).
 Most of existing meta-learning algorithms learn a globally shared meta-learner (e.g, parameter initialization (Finn et al., 2017; 2018), meta-optimizer (Ravi & Larochelle, 2016), metric space (Snell et al., 2017; Garcia & Bruna, 2017; Oreshkin et al., 2018)).
 However, the inference and learning of general MRFs are challenging due to the presence of a global normalizing factor, i.g,partition function, especially when latent variables are present.
 For these scenarios, the power provision and computational strength on the edge computing devices are limited.
 This performance advantage of supervised learning requires a lot of labelled data, which is expensive.
 Continual learning is often formulated as an incremental / online multi-task learning that models complex task-to-task relationships, either by sharing basis vectors in linear models (Kumar & Daume III, 2012; Ruvolo & Eaton, 2013) or weights in neural networks (Li & Hoiem, 2016).
 A continual learner must be able to learn a new task, crucially, without forgetting previous tasks (Ring, 1995; Srivastava et al., 2013; Schwarz et al., 2018; Serra et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2019).
 The CVRP is NP-hard (Dantzig & Ramser, 1959), and both exact and heuristic methods have been developed to solve it (Fukasawa et al., 2006; Golden et al., 2008; Kumar & Panneerselvam, 2012; Toth & Vigo, 2014).
 Performance in such tasks has to be measured via two axes: prediction quality and prediction speed, as scoring many candidates can be prohibitively slow.
 Network quantization (Wang et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2017) becomes one of the most hardware friendly CNN acceleration techniques by approximating real-valued weights and activations to QBN -bit fixed-point representations, and performing inferences using cheaper fixed-point multiple-accumulation (MAC) operations, where QBN is the quantization bit number.
 Recently, there is a growing interest in neural architecture search (NAS), which automatically searches for high-performance architectures for the given task.
 Formally, these kinds of problems are often defined as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) (Kaelbling et al., 1998), which demand information from past observations to help in the decision-making process (McCallum, 1993).
 Because policy gradient algorithms directly optimizing return estimated from rollouts (e.g, REINFORCE (Williams, 1992)) could suffer from high variance (Sutton & Barto, 2018), value function baselines were introduced by actor-critic methods to reduce the variance and improve the sample-efficiency.
 In contrast to supervised and semi-supervised learning, the learner has access only to unlabeled data.
 One particular framework, which we denote by zero-shot supervised framework (Zhang et al., 2018a;c; Nichol et al., 2018; Justesen et al., 2018) and is used to study RL generalization, is to treat it analogous to a classical supervised learning (SL) problem – i.g,assume there exists a distribution of MDP’s, train jointly on a finite “training set” sampled from this distribution, and check expected performance on the entire distribution, with the fixed trained policy.
 In other words, CNNs are not robust to small, carefully-crafted image perturbations.
 To reduce memory footprint and computational burden, several model compression methods such as quantization (Zhou et al., 2016), pruning (Han et al., 2015) and low-rank decomposition (Denil et al., 2013) have been widely explored.
 In a TEGI, there is an environment with uncertainty and two players on opposite sides (Koller & Megiddo, 1992).
 Traditional evaluation of DNNs based on the testing accuracy cannot insightfully examine the correctness of representations of a DNN due to leaked data or shifted datasets (Ribeiro et al., 2016).
 The reconstructed surface models and color information often exhibit inaccuracies or are comparably coarse (e.g, Izadi et al., (2011)).
 As a consequence of such overparameterization, it is likely that the empirical loss function, in addition to being non-convex, can have substantial amount of global minimizers (Choromanska et al., 2015), while only a small subset of global minimizers have the desired generalization properties (Brutzkus et al., 2018).
 Recently, the first-ever end-to-end fact-checking system has been designed and proposed in Hassan et al., (2017).
 A popular technique for RL meta-learning is Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) (Finn et al., 2017; 2018), a model for training an agent which can quickly adapt to new and unknown tasks by performing one (or a few) gradient updates in the new environment.
 These findings have sparked a new research direction called Memory Augmented Neural Networks (MANNs) that emulate modern computer behavior by detaching memorization from computation via memory and controller network, respectively.
 Furthermore, reasoning over long-horizon tasks introduces two additional major challenges.
 Successful algorithms include deep Q-network (DQN) (Mnih et al., 2015), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) (Lillicrap et al., 2015), and advantage actor critic (A2C) (Mnih et al., 2016).
 Because the inputs and outputs are sets, this problem has some unique challenges.
 On the other hand, there is a trend in the natural language processing (NLP) community of leveraging pre-trained language models (LMs), e.g, ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), as a means of acquiring contextualized word representations.
 Here, we choose knowledge graph scenarios to study reasoning where semantics have been defined on nodes and edges.
 As DNNs are being widely deployed, it is imperative to improve model robustness and defend adversarial attacks, especially in safety-critical cases.
 While there has been a considerable progress in recent years, common assumptions about disentangled representations appear to be inadequate (Locatello et al., 2019).
Humans demonstrate this ability in many different domains, such as natural language understanding (NLU) and visual scene understanding.
 It has been widely recognized that the DNNs trained by the SCE loss are vulnerable to adversarial attacks (Carlini & Wagner, 2017a; Goodfellow et al., 2015; Kurakin et al., 2017; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016; Papernot et al., 2016), where human imperceptible perturbations can be crafted to fool a high-performance network.
 Since these bounds, which depend solely on the capacity of the learned model, are unable to account for the success of neural networks, we must examine additional properties of the learning process.
 The information bottleneck (Tishby et al., 2000) formalizes this in terms of minimizing the mutual information between the bottleneck representation layer with the input, while maximizing its mutual information with the correct output.
 We use this ability not just to perceive, but also to act: for instance, we know to be cautious about dropping a vase, guided by the intuition that the act of breaking a vase cannot be undone.
 Moreover, such perturbations are almost imperceptible to humans and often transfer across diverse models to achieve black-box attacks (Papernot et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020).
 In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to reach high accuracies in classification tasks on images and videos reducing the need for manual feature engineering.
 Learning such models requires answering counterfactual questions (Rubin, 1974; Pearl, 2009) such as: “Would this patient have lived longer and by how much, had she received an alternative treatment?”.
 One recent approach is to construct options that aid exploration by providing agents with more decisive behavior than the dithering common to random exploration (e.g, Menache et al., 2002; Stolle and Precup, 2002; Şimşek and Barto, 2004; Şimşek et al., 2005; Şimşek and Barto, 2009; Machado et al., 2017; Eysenbach et al., 2019).
 GAN methods train an unconditional generator that regresses real images from random noise and a discriminator that measures the difference between generated samples and real images.
 A recent example is the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) in which there is a vector space V of value vectors and an inner product space H of query and key vectors.
 Meta-imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach for allowing an agent to leverage data from previous tasks in order to learn a new task from only a handful of demonstrations (Duan et al., 2017; Finn et al., 2017b; James et al., 2018).
 Building upon these work, most recently Zhao et al., (Zhao et al., 2018b) leveraged image transformation techniques to improve the robustness of such adversarial sticker attacks in outdoor settings, and were able to achieve a 72% attack success rate with a car running at a constant speed of 30 km/h on real roads.
 On the other hand, there exist alternative and inexpensive methods for mining large-scale data with labels, such as querying commercial search engines (Li et al., 2017a), downloading social media images with tags (Mahajan et al., 2018), leveraging machine-generated labels (Kuznetsova et al., 2018), or using a single annotator to label each sample (Tanno et al., 2019).
 The perturbation required for misclassification is often small and bounded by an Lp-norm ‖x′ − x‖p ≤ , which keeps x′ within the -ball centered at x, so that it is visually the “same” for human observers.
Policy gradients, however, can suffer from large variance that may limit performance, especially for high-dimensional action spaces (Wu et al., 2018).
 Yet offloading data or processed features to a cloud operator would put the individual privacy at risk.
 Due to a key property of interpolation – automatic variance reduction (discussed in Section 2.1), stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with constant step size is shown to converge to the optimum of a convex loss function for a wide range of step sizes (12).
 Self-supervision builds on the fact that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) transfer well between tasks (Shin et al., 2016; Oquab et al., 2014; Girshick, 2015; Huh et al., 2016).
 Then, the observations x are sampled from a conditional distribution p(x|z).
Recent investigations into these and other questions have emphasised the role of overparameterisation, or highly redundant function representation.
 This is particularly necessary for deep neural network classifiers, which can be easily fooled by OOD data (Nguyen et al., 2015).
 We explore language-conditioned policy learning, where agents use machine reading to discover strategies required to solve a task, thereby leveraging language as a means to generalise to new environments.
 We have also seen the first results studying the universality of graph neural networks, i.g,, neural networks that take graphs as input.
 This is important for neural networks, which are data-hungry and prone to overfitting.
 Correlation-based learning may also struggle in sparsely rewarding environments since by definition there are fewer rewards, and hence fewer instances when policy-reward correlations can be measured and learned from.
 This is arguably a desirable property, as it affects the replicability and interpretability of the model’s predictions.
 However, MBRL algorithms generally do not scale well with the increasing complexity of the reinforcement learning (RL) tasks in practice.
The key technical challenge of learning from demonstrations is the covariate shift: the distribution of the states visited by the demonstrations often has a low-dimensional support; however, knowledge learned from this distribution may not necessarily transfer to other distributions of interests.
 The use of a function approximator introduces a projection of the tabular TD update into the class of representable functions.
 These models learn to generalize in these low-resource conditions by recreating such training episodes from the data available.
 Modern techniques in computer vision (e.g,Krizhevsky et al., (2012); He et al., (2016); Cubuk et al., (2018); Gastaldi (2017)), speech recognition (e.g, Amodei et al., (2016)), natural language processing (e.g, Vaswani et al., (2017)), and reinforcement learning (e.g, Silver et al., (2017)) use SGD with stochastic momentum to train models.
 However, real-world RL agents inhabit natural environments populated by other agents, including humans, who can only modify another agent’s observations via their actions.
 However, the application of machine learning technology has been largely constrained to situations where large amounts of supervision is available, such as in image classification or machine translation, or where highly accurate simulations of the environment are available to the learning agent, such as in game-playing agents.
 GCNs and variants thereof have attained remarkable success in social network analysis, 3D point cloud processing, recommender systems and action recognition.
 Interestingly, pretrained models also perform well on tasks that require grounding language and reasoning about the real world.
 As we trust them with more and more important decisions, the cost of such mistakes grows ever higher.
 As the onus of performance optimization shifts to software, new models, representations, and methodologies for program understanding are needed to drive research and development in computer architectures, compilers, and to aid engineers in writing high performance code.
 However, recent years witness the fast-growing demand for real-time usage of semantic segmentation, e.g, autonomous driving.
 Dai et al., (2017) proposed how to create complement data, and theoretically showed that complement data, considered as unseen data, could improve semi-supervised learning.
 For example, for image classification task, the objective function is often chosen as the cross entropy between the probability distribution calculated by forward propagation of a convolutional neural network and the vector encoding true label information (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014; He et al., 2016), where the cross entropy is a surrogate loss of the misclassification rate.
 Such vulnerability creates security concerns in many real-world applications.
 Since the discovery of adversarial examples, there has been a constant “arms race” between better attacks and better defenses.
 These vulnerabilities in deep neural networks hinder their deployment in sensitive domains including, but not limited to, health care, finances, autonomous driving, and defense-related applications and have become a major security concern.
There are many types of PO tasks; however, those that can be solved by taking the history of observations into account are more common.
 Recently, grounded language learning has gradually attracted attention in various domains, inspired by the hypothesis that early language learning was focused on problemsolving (Kirby & Hurford, 2002).
 There are several approaches to find adversarial examples for black-box neural networks.
 Conventional model evaluation methodology for image classification generally follows a three-step approach (Burnham & Anderson, 2003).
 They have designed two variants of models, BERTLARGE (340M parameters) and BERTBASE (110M parameters).
 At each time step, the environment is in a state s.
 They provide state-of-the-art classification results among predefined or unsupervised representations, and are nearly as efficient as learned deep networks on relatively simple image datasets, such as digits in MNIST, textures (Bruna & Mallat, 2013) or small CIFAR images (Oyallon & Mallat, 2014; Mallat, 2016).
 The vast overparametrization of neural networks offers better convergence (AllenZhu et al., 2019) and better generalization (Neyshabur et al., 2018).
 Our results concern the slightly over-parameterized regime where n ≈ m.
 For example, we train an autoencoder to learn a mapping from the data to the bottleneck layer and use the bottleneck representation or reconstruction error to detect the OOD (Sakruada et al., 2014; Pidhorskyi et al., 2018).
 To the many deficiencies in our knowledge of deep learning theory, the investigation into the loss surfaces of neural networks is of fundamental importance.
 Models that are able to better capture the complex behavior of such multi-object systems are of wide interest to various communities, e.g, physics, ecology, biology, geoscience, and finance.
 In the PS setting, there commonly exist one (or several) parameter servers and multiple worker nodes.
Recently, a number of deep multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches have been proposed to address complex multiagent problems, e.g, coordination of robot swarm systems (Sosic et al., 2017) and autonomous cars (Oh et al., 2015).
 In addition, our method is general enough to position the extracted character in a new background, which is possibly also dynamic.
 As a result, both the quality and diversity of generated text samples are limited.
 Even worse, DNNs could not generalize the training data in the presence of noisy examples (Zhang et al., 2016).
 While there is no canonical definition for this term, we adopt the one where individual latent units are sensitive to changes in single generative factors while being relatively invariant to nuisance factors (Bengio et al., 2013).
 Various empirical defenses (e.g, Goodfellow et al., (2015); Svoboda et al., (2019); Buckman et al., (2018); Ma et al., (2018); Guo et al., (2018); Dhillon et al., (2018); Xie et al., (2018); Song et al., (2018)) have been proposed to defend against adversarial perturbations.
While most provably efficient methods for tabular RL are model-based (Brafman and Tennenholtz, 2002; Strehl and Littman, 2008; Azar et al., 2017), in deep RL, learning models that are useful for planning is notoriously difficult and often more complex (Hafner et al., 2019) than modelfree methods.
 Recently in natural language processing (NLP), Transformer networks (Vaswani et al., 2017) pre-trained with “masked language model” (MLM) objective (Devlin et al., 2018) on large language corpus excel at a variety of NLP tasks.
 Humans are remarkably adept at making abstractions of the world (Hudson & Manning, 2019); we see in raw visual signals, abstract semantics away from deformation, and form concepts.
 As NNs are increasingly being applied to safety-critical tasks such as medical diagnosis (De Fauw et al., 2018), biometric identification (Schroff et al., 2015) and self driving cars, estimating uncertainty in model’s predictions is crucial, as it enables the safety of an AI system (Amodei et al., 2016) to be improved by acting on the predictions in an informed manner.
 However, due to the sequential nature of the widely used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, distributing the process is not an easy task.
Efforts have been made to have such models produce disentangled latent representations that can control interpretable properties of images (Kulkarni et al., 2015; Higgins et al., 2017).
 In this work, we bridge the gap between unsupervised discovery of objects from video and learning the physical dynamics of a system, by learning unknown physical parameters and explicit trajectory coordinates.
 In many cases—including graph distances, certain clustering algorithms, and general value functions in reinforcement learning (RL)—it is either known that distances satisfy the triangle inequality, or required for purposes of theoretical guarantees; e.g, speed and loss guarantees in k-nearest neighbors and clustering (Cover and Hart, 1967; Indyk, 1999; Davidson and Ravi, 2009), or optimality guarantees for A∗ search (Russell and Norvig, 2016).
 Indeed, in the absence of practical answers to the above questions, surrogate approaches have proven useful.
 More precisely, we consider the problem of designing neural KB inference modules that are (1) fully differentiable, so that any loss based on their outputs can be backpropagated to their inputs; (2) accurate, in that they are faithful to the original semantics of the KB; (3) expressive, so they can perform non-trivial inferences; and (4) scalable, so that realistically large KBs can be incorporated into a neural model.
 Recent efforts have focused on automating the program verification process, but automated verification of general programs with unbounded loops remains an open problem (Nelson et al., 2017; 2019).
 Research in the last two years has proceeded at a rapid pace and many search strategies have been proposed, from Reinforcement Learning (Zoph & Le, 2017; Pham et al., 2018), to Evolutionary Algorithms (Real et al., 2017), to Gradient-based methods (Liu et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2019).
 Despite the significant breakthrough in supervised learning, the potential of applying deep architectures to unsupervised learning problems remains largely unexplored.
 It is easier to tell the nearer one between two objects in a picture than to estimate the distance of each object directly (Chen et al., 2016; Lee & Kim, 2019a).
 It is time to challenge state-of-the-art models with more difficult reading comprehension tasks and move a step forward to more comprehensive analysis and reasoning over text (Dua et al., 2019).
 This is particularly important for tasks such as activity recognition, as understanding detailed semantic contents of the video is needed.
 A case in point is the example of the FC7 features from the AlexNet image classification architecture that have been used for many other vision problems (Krizhevsky et al., 2012).
 It is therefore not surprising that generative models have gained momentum in applications such as computer vision (Sohn et al., 2015; Brock et al., 2019), NLP (Bowman et al., 2016; Severyn et al., 2017), and chemistry (Kusner et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2018; Gómez-Bombarelli et al., 2018).
 However, comparing with classification, object detection aims to know not only what but also where the object is.
 Following the enormous success of deep learning in various domains, such as the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to computer vision (LeCun et al., 1998; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Long et al., 2015; Ren et al., 2015), a need for understanding and analyzing the trained models has arisen.
 Examples include the ambiguity of experimental procedures, the impossibility of reproducing results and the improper comparison of machine learning models.
 Intuitively, if the weights start small, since the most popular training algorithms make small, incremental updates that get smaller as the training accuracy improves, there is a tendency for these algorithms to produce small weights.
 The goal is to minimize regret, defined as the difference between the cumulative loss of the learner and that of the best decision in hindsight (Hazan et al., 2016):R(T ) := T∑ t=1 ft(xt)−min x∈D T∑ t=1 ft(x).
 This problem is also known as the stability-plasticity dilemma (Grossberg, 1987).
Although the term itself has fallen somewhat out of favour, multiplicative interactions have reappeared in a range of modern architectural designs.
 However, GNNs still fall short in the ”few-shot” learning setting, where the classifier must generalize well after seeing abundant base-class samples (while training) and very few (or even zero) samples from a novel class (while testing).
 To address these challenges, many reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been proposed for learning sequential decision-making policies (Sutton et al., 1998; Kaelbling et al., 1996; Mnih et al., 2015).
 In such cases, transfer learning is often adopted to overcome these hurdles.
 On the other hand, when people attempt to dive into a specific topic, they may clearly realize the gap between the conversation with a state-of-the-art system and the conversation with humans, as the system is only able to awkwardly catch up with the conversation, owing to the lack of knowledge of the subject.
 In particular, the challenging task of generating stereo images given a single input view is of great interest as it enables 3D visualization of the 2D input scene.
 Leveraging the hierarchical structures of language gives models more structural information about the data and improves performance on the downstream tasks (Tai et al., 2015; Eriguchi et al., 2016).
We show the following results for large P and for a fixed number of datapoints N :
 In a non-cooperative game, we are interested in the Nash equilibrium (Nash, 1951), which is a joint policy of all the agents such that each agent cannot decrease its expected total cost by unilaterally deviating from its Nash policy.
 For instance, can we trust decisions that neural networks make (EU Data Protection Regulation, 2016; Goodman & Flaxman, 2017; NIPS IML Symposium, 2017)? One way to address this problem is to define properties that we expect the network to satisfy.
 Most methods use adversarial learning (Goodfellow et al., 2014), in which the generator is pitted against a critic function, also called a discriminator, which is trained to distinguish between the samples from the data distribution and from the generator.
 In order to deliver on this promise, we believe it is important to represent programs and specifications in a way that supports learning.
 The clip-based methods randomly sample a short clip (e.g, 32 frames) from a video for representation learning, and calculate prediction scores for each clip independently.
 While the use of temporally extended actions, or options (Sutton et al., 1999), has been shown to accelerate learning (McGovern & Sutton, 1998), there remains the question of skill discovery: how can agents autonomously construct useful skills via interaction with the environment? While a large body of work has sought to answer this question in small discrete domains, skill discovery in high-dimensional continuous spaces remains an open problem.
 While often performed with humorous or artistic intent, they can wreak havoc by altering medical records (Mirsky et al., 2019), concealing scientific misconduct (Gilbert, 2009; Bik et al., 2016; Bucci, 2018) or even interfering with democratic elections (Chesney & Citron, 2019).
 Recently, many efforts have been made to accelerate optimization by applying adaptive learning rate.
 Prior work tackles such situations with dedicated exploration methods (Houthooft et al., 2016; Osband et al., 2016; Andrychowicz et al., 2017), or by using large amounts of random exploration (Mnih et al., 2015), which is feasible in simulation but infeasible for real-world robotic learning.
 Few-shot learning aims to bridge the sample-efficiency gap between deep learning and human learning in fields such as computer vision, reinforcement learning and speech recognition (Santoro et al., 2016; Ravi & Larochelle, 2017; Finn et al., 2017; Vinyals et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019a).
 The idea that a good representation can help with such shortcomings is not new, and recently a number of papers have demonstrated that models with disentangled representations show improvements in terms of these shortcomings (Higgins et al., 2017b; 2018b; Achille et al., 2018; Steenbrugge et al., 2018; Nair et al., 2018; Laversanne-Finot et al., 2018; van Steenkiste et al., 2019; Locatello et al., 2019).
 The complex components come in the form of modules for better learning relationships among features, such as interactions between user and ad features (Cheng et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017; Lian et al., 2018; Song et al., 2018).
Recently, there has been a surge of interest in MI estimation with variational approaches (Barber & Agakov, 2003; Nguyen et al., 2010; Donsker & Varadhan, 1975), which can be naturally combined with deep learning methods (Alemi et al., 2016; van den Oord et al., 2018; Poole et al., 2019).
 Discovering structure in data—such as objects—and learning to represent data in a compact fashion without supervision are long-standing problems in machine learning (Comon, 1992; Tishby et al., 2000), often formulated as generative latent-variable modelling (e.g, Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014).
 It was hypothesized that exposure bias, differences in the training and inference procedures, is the root cause for poor sample quality.
 In other words, there exists many plausible output images that satisfy a given input condition, which motivates us to explore multi-mode conditional image generation that produces diverse images conditioned on one single input condition.
 Current research seeks to develop methods for creating deep networks that maintain high accuracy while reducing the precision needed to represent their activations and weights, thereby reducing the computation and memory required for their implementation.
 The most recent models, however, produce diverse high-resolution images that are often indistinguishable from natural photos (Brock et al., 2018; Karras et al., 2018).
 For such models to work, however, they need a large amount of pixel-level annotations that may require costly human labor (Cordts et al., 2016; Bearman et al., 2016).
 Research on generating these malicious inputs started in the white-box setting, where access to the gradients of the models is assumed.
 For example, in one-class classification (Moya et al., 1993; Schölkopf et al., 2001) the objective is to find a set of small measure which contains most of the data and samples not contained in that set are deemed anomalous.
 Much of these performance improvements were enabled by an ever-increasing amount of labeled visual data (Russakovsky et al., 2015; Kuznetsova et al., 2018) and innovations in training architectures (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; He et al., 2016).
 In particular, when the embedding dimension is high, evaluating the distance of any query to all the instances in a large database is expensive, so that efficient search without sacrificing accuracy is difficult.
 In practice, if the state space is large or infinite, function approximation is often used to find an approximate value function efficiently.
 In contrast, many real-world behaviors are easier to demonstrate rather than devise explicit rewards.
 Broadly speaking, these approaches define a family of tasks, some of which are used for training and others solely for evaluation.
 Purely experimental approaches are often time consuming and expensive.
 These guarantees have been used to explain the successes of popular algorithms such as SVM (Boser et al., 1992; Cortes and Vapnik, 1995).
 Generated text in open-ended applications such as language modeling or dialogue has been observed to be dull, with high frequency tokens used too often and interesting content words used too rarely (Holtzman et al., 2019; Dinan et al., 2019).
 In this paper we show that semi-supervised latent variable models can take us a significant step closer towards solving this problem.
 Extrapolation can be formalized in a number of ways: it can refer to making predictions on inputs outside the support of the training data, making predictions with high Bayesian or Frequentist uncertainty, or making predictions that depend strongly on arbitrary choices outside of the learning problem specification (e.g, a random seed).
 Another line of recent research reveals interesting geometric properties relating to adversarial robustness of DNNs (Fawzi et al., 2017; 2018; Wang et al., 2018b; Yu et al., 2018).
 However, the collaborative nature of this process, in which task-specific information must be sent to and used by a meta-learner, also introduces inherent data privacy risks.
 We focus on few-shot classification: classifying unseen examples into one of N new ‘test’ classes, given only a few reference examples of each.
 The function should be designed such that the relevant (q,d) pairs have high scores, whereas the irrelevant ones have low scores.
 By letting the model choose its own behavior, we cannot direct it to achieve different goals.
 In social dilemmas, mutual cooperation has higher global payoff but agents’ individual goals may lead to defection out of fear or greed (Van Lange et al., 2013).
 In the case of photographic images, the denoising problem is both an important application, as well as a useful test-bed for our understanding of natural images.
 Many adversarial attacks have been proposed in the literature.
 To imitate or even surpass the success of hand-optimized libraries, recent research has developed stochastic optimization passes: for general code, STOKE (Schkufza et al., 2013), and neural network code, TVM (Chen et al., 2018a) and TensorComprehensions (Vasilache et al., 2018).
 A well-studied contextual illusion is the orientation-tilt illusion depicted in fig.  1a, where perception of the central grating’s orientation is influenced by the orientation of the surrounding grating (O’Toole & Wenderoth, 1977).
 For instance, some classification tasks address distributional changes in the input: from lacking guarantees of distributional match between train and test (e.g, covariate shift, Shimodaira, 2000) to having fundamental domain differences (e.g, domain adaptation, Crammer et al., 2007; Ben-David et al., 2007).
 In contrast, non-autoregressive translation (NAT) models (Gu et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018) predict the whole sequence or multi-token chunks of the sequence simultaneously, alleviating this problem by trading the model’s capacity for decoding efficiency.
 There have been prominent applications and ever-growing trends in deploying FL in practice, such as loan status prediction, health situation assessment (e.g, potential cancer risk assessment), and next-word prediction while typing (Hard et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018; 2019).
 Furthermore, the posterior distribution over the model parameters provides valuable information for evaluation and compression of neural networks.
 While the true reason why these methods work is still an active area of research (Santurkar et al., 2018), normalization techniques typically serve the purpose of making neural networks more amenable to optimization, allowing the training of very deep networks without the use of careful initialization schemes (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015; Zhang et al., 2019), custom nonlinearities (Klambauer et al., 2017), or other more complicated techniques (Xiao et al., 2018).
 By training RNN optimizers on predefined optimization problems, the optimizers are capable of learning to explore the loss landscape and adaptively choose descent directions and steps (Lv et al., 2017).
 Thus, scaling RL via multi-node distribution is of importance to AI – that is the focus of this work.
 One intuition for this shortcoming is that unlike traditional supervised learning algorithms, deep learning models typically overfit the training data (Zhang et al., 2017).
 At the same time, there is a growing demand to deploy deep learning technology in edge devices such as mobile phones, VR/AR glasses, and drones (Wu et al., 2019).
 Answering complex compositional questions against text is challenging since it requires a comprehensive understanding of both the question semantics and the text against which the question needs to be answered.
 In working around this problem, many learning-based approaches to 3D object representation suffer from problems related to memory usage, computational burden, or sampling efficiency.
 There also exist probabilistic graphic model based bidirectional methods (Srivastava & Salakhutdinov, 2012b;a; Wang et al., 2018) that capture the joint distribution of images and texts.
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) (Pham et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018b; Guo et al., 2019) is proposed to automatically search network structure for alleviating the complicated network design and heavy dependence on prior knowledge.
 In pursuit of this objective we study Interactive Fiction (IF) games, or text-adventures: simulations in which an agent interacts with the world purely through natural language—“seeing” and “talking” to the world using textual descriptions and commands.
 First, it enables the handling of sparse-reward environments by leveraging the dense signal of dynamics prediction.
 But many problems are still considered intractable from this perspective.
 Moreover, the large parameter space of CNNs encourages researchers to study regularization methods that prevent overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014).
 Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) (Bruna et al., 2013; Defferrard et al., 2016) have been proposed to address this shortcoming, and have been successfully applied to several domains such as social networks (Hamilton et al., 2017), knowledge graphs (Schlichtkrull et al., 2017; Shang et al., 2019), natural language processing (Marcheggiani & Titov, 2017; Vashishth et al., 2018a;b; 2019), drug discovery (Ramsundar et al., 2019), crystal property prediction (Sanyal et al., 2018), and natural sciences (Fout et al., 2017).
 Causal graphical models (CGM) (Peters et al., 2017) are BNs which support interventional queries like: What will happen if someone external to the system intervenes on variable X? Recent work suggests that causality could partially solve challenges faced by current machine learning systems such as robustness to out-of-distribution samples, adaptability and explainability (Pearl, 2019; Magliacane et al., 2018).
 For example, despite having more parameters than training examples, deep neural networks generalize well without an explicit form of regularization (Zhang et al., 2017; Neyshabur et al., 2017; Arora et al., 2019a).
 This leads to an important open question in the Deep Learning community (Zhang et al., (2017); Arpit et al., (2017); Bartlett et al., (2017); Kawaguchi et al., (2017); Neyshabur et al., (2018); Arora et al., (2018); Belkin et al., (2019); Rahaman et al., (2019); Nagarajan & Kolter (2019), etc.): Among all maps that fit a real dataset, how does Gradient Descent (GD) find one that generalizes well? This is the question we address in this paper.
 You might conclude that the woman is the mother of the little girl.
 A crucial part of a task-oriented dialogue system is Dialogue State Tracking (DST), which aims to identify user goals expressed during a conversation in the form of dialogue states.
 The model parameters (state/input/prediction parameters) are learnt by minimizing an empirical loss.
 A large body of work has focused on understanding what happens during the later stages of training (Neyshabur et al., 2019; Yaida, 2019; Chaudhuri & Soatto, 2017; Wei & Schwab, 2019), while the initial phase has been less explored.
Despite the success of BN, it’s still challenging to utilize BN when batch size is extremely small1.
 In many other tasks, the sequential decision making is distributed by nature.
 First, ANNs are often trained on curated datasets of images designed to best capture the image content, whereas in real-world scenarios, they may be tested on disturbed or noisy inputs, not observed during training.
 For example, (a) the objective function is not convex; (b) errors back-propagate; and (c) there is potential for exploding and vanishing gradients.
 In principle, convolutional weights could be learned directly from data.
 Towards this goal, semi-supervised learning (Chapelle et al., 2009) methods that take advantage of both labeled and unlabeled data are a natural starting point.
 Often we encounter missing data problems, where some subprocesses are not fully observable.
 Support for gradual typing now exists in many popular programming languages (Bierman et al., 2014; Vitousek et al., 2014), but due to their heavy use of dynamic language constructs and the absence of principal types (Ancona & Zucca, 2004), compilers cannot perform type inference using standard algorithms from the programming languages community (Bierman et al., 2014; Traytel et al., 2011; Pierce & Turner, 2000), and manually adding type annotations to existing codebases is a tedious and error-prone task.
 In conjunction with the neurological studies, it is also a well known fact that a human speech production system is directly related to the shape of the vocal tract (Mermelstein, 1967; Teager & Teager, 1990).
 A basic prediction task is view prediction: from one viewpoint, predict what the scene would look like from another viewpoint.
 Visual phenomena, however, follow a long-tailed distribution that many standard approaches fail to properly model, leading to a significant drop in accuracy.
 This approach has yielded impressive results in recent years, including playing computer games with super human performance (Mnih et al., 2015; Tessler et al., 2016), multi-task RL (Rusu et al., 2016; Devin et al., 2017; Teh et al., 2017; Mankowitz et al., 2018b; Riedmiller et al., 2018) as well as solving complex continuous control robotic tasks (Duan et al., 2016; Abdolmaleki et al., 2018b; Kalashnikov et al., 2018; Haarnoja et al., 2018).
Overcoming these challenges is the focus of continual learning, sometimes also referred to as lifelong learning or sequential learning.
 Learning with noisy labels is thus an promising area.
 The data may contain financial, medical, or behavioral information about individuals.
 Many researchers demonstrate that a good ensemble is one where the ensemble’s members are both accurate and make independent errors (Perrone & Cooper, 1992; Maclin & Opitz, 1999).
 Today, most researchers consent that two distinct characteristics of BP render the idea of a BP based learning in brains as implausible: 1) The usage of symmetric forward and backward connections and 2) the strict separation of activity and error propagation (Bartunov et al., 2018).
 In the infinite-width limit, the NTK converges to a limiting kernel which stays constant during training; on the other hand, when the width is large enough, the function learned by gradient descent follows the NTK (Jacot et al., 2018).
 Particularly, the sparsely available data points cause substantial numerical error when we utilize existing finite difference operators and the limitation requires a more principled way to redesign deep learning models.
 Bits back was first introduced to form a theoretical argument for using the ELBO as an objective function for machine learning (Hinton & van Camp, 1993).
 Other architectures such as IMPALA can achieve much higher throughputs due to the asynchronous collection of samples from workers.
 The encoder maps a contextual input to a latent representation, conditioning on which and previously generated tokens the decoder generates categorical tokens in a consecutive manner (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014; Rush et al., 2015; Chopra et al., 2016).
 Despite these successes, the training of GANs remains quite unstable in nature, and this instability remains difficult to understand theoretically.
 However, transfer learning from a source task to many target tasks incurs overall significant training and space overhead due to multiple large models to customize and store (Mudrakarta et al., 2019).
 Since the reward and next state depend on what action the policy chooses, simply averaging rewards in off-policy data does not estimate the target policy’s long-term reward.
A key issue with GNNs is their depth limitations.
 Although training on properly labeled data usually leads to good generalization performance, the ability to over-fit the entire training dataset is undesirable for generalization when noisy labels are present.
 More control could be used toimprove existing approaches which aim at generating new training examples (Bowles et al., 2018) by allowing the user to choose more specific properties of the generated images.
 It typically manifests itself via a set of assumptions, which in turn can guide a learning algorithm to pick one hypothesis over another.
 More specifically, SDL (Olshausen & Field (1997); Mairal et al., (2008; 2012; 2014); Spielman et al., (2012); Sun et al., (2015); Bai et al., (2018); Qu et al., (2019)) concerns the problem of learning a compact, sparse representation from raw, unlabelled data: given a data matrix Y = y1,y2, . ,yp ∈ Rn×p that contains p n-dimensional samples, one aims to find a linear transformation (i.g, a dictionary) D ∈ Rn×m and an associated maximally sparse representation X = x1,x2, . ,xp ∈ Rm×p that satisfies Y = DX.
 Similarly, understanding when they use their TV, air-conditioner, or washer and dryer provides knowledge of their behavior and habits.
 It is not understood how nonlinear neural networks can be efficiently trained to approximate complex decision boundaries with a relatively few number of training samples.
 Thus, IIGs provide more realistic modeling than perfect information games for many real-world applications, such as trading, traffic routing, and politics.
 Therefore, with the same goal of cross-lingual transfer but for these more complex models, we might consider contextual embedding alignment, where we observe whether word pairs within parallel sentences, e.g, cat in “The cat sits” and Katze in “Die Katze sitzt,” have similar representations.
Saliency methods in computer vision and reinforcement learning use similar procedures to generate these maps.
Generalization challenge A natural expectation of the end user in this setting is that the synthesized program works well even when I is severely limited (e.g, to one or two examples).
 In complex control systems and model-based reinforcement learning, planning over a long horizon is often needed, while high frequency feedback is necessary for maintaining stability (Franklin et al., 2014).
The main reason for the robust performance of random forests is the decision tree ensembles.
 Fine-tuning is a simple and effective approach of transfer learning and has become popular for solving new tasks in which pre-trained models are fine-tuned with the target dataset.
 The latter can leverage large amounts of unannotated data and a simple log-likelihood training objective.
 Object identity represents the shape and texture of an object, and camera pose comprises camera rotation, translation, and intrinsics such as focal length.
Feng et al., (2018) exposed another type of problematic behaviour: deleting large parts of input text can cause a model’s confidence to increase; Figure 1 shows an example.
 These perturbations can be crafted to reduce accuracy during test time or veer predictions towards a target class.
 We estimated this plot by using published∗Work done while at Amazon Web Servicesnumbers for the estimate of the mean accuracy, the 95% confidence interval of this estimate and the number of few-shot episodes.
 While significant advances have been made, it has been shown that models that were estimated to be robust have later been broken by stronger attacks (Athalye et al., 2018; Uesato et al., 2018).
 This formulation makes intuitive sense when the output is a distribution, e.g, a probability mass function over classes.
 Symbolic superoptimization is an important component in compilers, e.g, LLVM and Halide, and it also has a wide application in mathematical engines including Wolfram2, Matlab, and Sympy.
 Data augmentation such as rotation, flipping, cropping, etc., is a powerful technique to increase the amount and diversity of data.
 Thus, many approaches resort to variance reduction methods, that reduce the model variance with respect to the change in the input.
 For instance, Angwin et al., (2016) present an example of a computer-based risk assessment model for recidivism, which is biased against certain ethnicities.
 Since data come from the same type of tissue, we would like to map cells between the two datasets to merge them, so that we could analyze them jointly.
These networks are largely over-parameterised; a fact that can be exploited when specialising networks for different resource budgets.
 Acknowledgement of this fact has resulted in the development of algorithms tailored to training models in the presence of noisy ground truth labels (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Frenay & Kaban, 2014; Zhu & Wu, 2004).
 The goal of disentangled representation learning is to learn a representation where each dimension of the representation corresponds to a distinct factor of variation in the dataset (Bengio et al., 2013).
 As adversarial examples can help identify the robustness of models (Arnab et al., 2018), as well as improve the robustness of models by adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2014), learning how to generate adversarial examples with high transferability is important and has gained increasing attentions in the literature (Liu et al., 2016; Dong et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2019; Dong et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019).
 A number of papers have attempted to understand the generalization phenomenon in deep models from a theoretical perspective e.g, (Neyshabur et al., 2015b; Bartlett et al., 2017; Neyshabur et al., 2018a; Golowich et al., 2017; Arora et al., 2018; Nagarajan and Kolter, 2019a; Wei and Ma, 2019a; Long and Sedghi, 2019).
 Moreover, it has been shown that the predictions of deep networks become unreliable and unstable when tested in unseen situations, e.g, in the presence of small adversarial perturbations to the input (Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2019).
 Namely, it assures that reshuffling the elements in X and applying F results in the same output, reshuffled in the same manner.
 Most machine learning applications currently depend on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Robbins & Monro, 1985) and in particular its mini-batch variant (Bottou, 2010; Dekel et al., 2012).
 Classically, these methods are trained in a supervised setting making their applications limited due to the a lack of good paired data.
Unlike simultaneous games, many practical machine learning algorithms, including generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Arjovsky et al., 2017), adversarial training (Madry et al., 2018) and primal-dual reinforcement learning (Du et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2018), explicitly specify the order of moves between players and the order of which player acts first is crucial for the problem.
 Data points adjacent in time can be highly correlated, and the overall distribution of the data can shift drastically as the training progresses.
 Interestingly, or rather unfortunately, there is no unified theory connecting node embeddings —low-rank matrix approximations, factor analysis, latent semantic analysis, etc.— with structural graph representations.
Despite burgeoning research, the problem of calibrating such models has been overlooked, and existing knowledge graph embedding models do not offer any guarantee on the probability estimates they assign to predicted facts.
 In neural networks, at first glance, zero imputation can be thought of as a reasonable solution since it simply drops missing input nodes by preventing the weights associated with them from being updated.
 Yet, when we revisit typical GCNs on node classification (Kipf & Welling, 2017), they are usually shallow (e.g, the number of the layers is 21).
 When paired samples are given, the mapping model can be trained in a supervised manner using a conditional generative model (Isola et al., (2017); Li et al., (2017a); Wang et al., (2018)) or a simple regression model (Larsson et al., (2016); Long et al., (2015); Zhang et al., (2016)).
 For example, there is no reason to compute features that help differentiate between several dog breeds, if there is no dog to be seen in the image.
 Due to the cost of acquiring large labeled datasets, a recently renewed focus on unsupervised representation learning seeks to generate representations, z, that are useful for a wide variety of different tasks where little to no labeled data is available (Devlin et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019).
 By carefully reducing the number of samples acquired over time, in pixel-coordinate space or in kspace, efficient subsampling schemes lead to meaningful reductions in acquisition time, radiation exposure, battery drain, and data transfer.
 Using machine learning for outlier/novelty detection is typically to train a model that learns the distribution where the training data samples are drawn from, and the final trained model could give a high anomaly score for the outliers/novelties that deviate from the same distribution.
 Given that execution efficiency is critical for the success of neural networks, there is growing interest in the use of optimizing static compilers for neural network computation graphs, such as Glow (Rotem et al., 2018), MLIR (MLIR Authors, 2018), TVM (Chen et al., 2018a), and XLA (XLA team, 2017).
 Irrespective of the task, a core problem for navigation in unknown environments is exploration, i.g,, how to efficiently visit as much of the environment.
Several efforts have in fact shown that DNNs behave in unexpected and incorrect ways for small, specifically designed input perturbations (Goodfellow et al., (2014)).
 A key feature of G-CNNs is that they are equivariant with respect to transformations described by the group, i.g,, they guarantee predictable behavior under such transformations and are insensitive to both local and global transformations on the input data.
 However, these tasks still mostly rely on handcrafted image features such as SIFT (Lowe et al., 1999) or ORB (Rublee et al., 2011), which have been shown to be limited in performance when compared to learned alternatives (Balntas et al., 2017).
 In an ideal situation, we would be able to extract sub-networks — automatically and without finetuning — from this over-parameterized network, for any given memory or latency constraint, while maintaining good performance.
Multilingual BERT2 (M-BERT), a Transformer-based (Vaswani et al., 2017) language model trained on raw Wikipedia text of 104 languages suggests an entirely different approach.
 For example, a structured representation may improve sample efficiency for downstream tasks such as a deep reinforcement learning agent (Mnih et al., 2013).
 On every graph G = (V,E), defined with set of nodes V and set of edgesE, the distance dG : V ×V → R+ between two vertices is defined as the number of edges connecting them in the shortest path, also called a graph geodesic.
Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) were proposed to combine hard logic rules and probabilistic graphical models, which can be applied to various tasks on knowledge graphs (Richardson & Domingos, 2006).
 Model Predictive Control (MPC, Maciejowski, 2000; Camacho & Bordons, 2007; Rawlings & Mayne, 2009; Kouvaritakis & Cannon, 2015; Gallieri, 2016; Borrelli et al., 2017; Raković & Levine, 2019) is the most successful advanced control methodology for systems with hard safety constraints.
 Recent theoretical results indicate that decentralized schemes can be as efficient as the centralized approaches, at least when considering convergence of training loss vs.
 Unfortunately, similar to the case of deep neural network classifiers with adversarial examples, recent studies show that deep RL agents are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks.
 The key difference between transformers and previous methods, such as recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), is that the former can simultaneously attend to every word of their input sequence.
 Off-policy policy evaluation methods (OPPE) utilize a set of previously-collected trajectories (for example, website interaction logs, patient trajectories, or robot trajectories) to estimate the value of a novel decision-making policy without interacting with the environment (Precup et al., 2001; Dudı́k et al., 2011).
 The primary difficulty with this approach is that researchers are hand-designing these strategies: it is difficult for humans to systematically consider the space of strategies or to tailor strategies for the distribution of environments an agent might be expected to face.
 Večerík et al., (2017), Merel et al., (2017) and Paine et al., (2018) have demonstrated similar results in robotics.
 In this paper, we mainly focus on few-shot learning (Vinyals et al., 2016), an instance of meta-learning problems, where a task t consists of a query set dt := {(xt,i, yt,i)}ni=1 serving as the test-set of the task and a support set dlt:={(xlt,i,ylt,i)}n li=1 serving as the train-set.
 Motivated by these success stories, we study the properties of conditional generative models in more detail.
 Humans can often effectively separate between the class identity of the object, and the transitory pose of the object, even from a single observation.
 Yet, many types of data have a strongly non-Euclidean latent structure (Bronstein et al., 2017), e.g, the set of human-interpretable images.
 The setting induces unusual constraints in black-box optimization and reinforcement learning: large synchronous batches with few rounds total.
 The growing costs and risks associated with the potential model failures has led to the importance of studying adversarial attacks, both in assessing their robustness and their ability to detect such attacks.
 We argue that agent should be able to solve multiple tasks with varying sources of reward.
 Examples are fraudulent transaction detection (Pawar et al., 2014; Porwal & Mukund, 2018), intrusion detection (Lee, 2017; Aoudi et al., 2018), video surveillance (Ravanbakhsh et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2015b), medical diagnosis (Schlegl et al., 2017; Baur et al., 2018) and equipment failure detection (Kuzin & Borovicka, 2016; Zhao et al., 2017; Beghi et al., 2014).
 On another front, computational physics researchers have been mastering the art of inventing geometric data structures and simulation algorithms to model complex physical systems (Gibou et al., 2019).
 Different from traditional word-specific embedding in which each token is assigned a global representation, recent work, such as Cove (McCann et al., 2017), ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), GPT (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), derives contextualized word vectors from a language model trained on a large text corpus.
 (b) Computational speed-up: computationally intensive floating-point multiply and add operations are replaced by efficient xnor and pop-count operations, which have been shown to provide practical speed-ups of up to 58× on CPU (Rastegari et al., 2016) and, as opposed to general low bit-width operations, are amenable to standard hardware.
From Eq.
 Although the tedious searching process is conducted by machines, humans still involve extensively in the design of the NAS algorithms.
 Homotopy methods are suitable to solve complex non-convex optimization problems where no or only little prior knowledge regarding the localization of the solutions is available.
 Since MI is invariant to invertible and smooth transformations, it can capture non-linear statistical dependencies between variables (Kinney & Atwal, 2014).
However, good performance comes at a high computational cost.
In fact, since networks used in practice are often so large that they can fit any function (any labels) over the training data, it is reasonable to think of the network as virtually infinite-sized, and thus able to represent essentially all functions.
 Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) was proposed as a solution to the issues present in the original GAN formulation.
 This leads to what is known as Catastrophic Forgetting (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989; McClelland et al., 1995); significant drop in previously obtained knowledge of an AI system as it learns new information and gets less/no exposure to old information.
 Imitation learning methods can be generally divided into two categories: behavior cloning (BC) and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL).
 Back to the 1930s, Wertheimer (1938) listed several vital factors, such as similarity, proximity, and good continuation, which lead to visual grouping.
 The fast growth of DNNs based solutions demands in-depth studies on adversarial examples to help better understand potential vulnerabilities of ML models and therefore improve their robustness.
One major problem with GANs is the instability of the training procedure and the general sensitivity of the results to various hyperparameters (Salimans et al., 2016).
 Working towards an understanding of gradient descent on shallow (and deep!) networks, researchers began investigating the neural tangent kernel (NTK) (Jacot et al., 2018; Du et al., 2018; Allen-Zhu et al., 2018), which replaces a network with its linearization at initialization, meaning x 7→ √ m m∑ j=1 sj 〈 τj , x̃ 〉 σ′ (〈 w̃j , x̃ 〉) , where x̃ = (x, 1) ∈ Rd+1, w̃ = (w, b) ∈ Rd+1; (1.2)here each w̃j = (wj , bj) is frozen at Gaussian initialization (henceforth the bias is collapsed in for convenience), and each transported weight τj is microscopically close to the corresponding initial weight w̃j , concretely ‖τj − w̃j‖ = O(1/ √m), where > 0 is a parameter and the scaling /√m is conventional in this literature (Allen-Zhu et al., 2018).
 These include interpretability, sample efficiency, the ability of reasoning and causal inference, as well as compositionality and transferability for better generalization.
 Hence, it is vital to preemptively identify and control threats from an adversarial lens focused at such models.
Domain adaptation aims to address this problem, especially when annotating images from the target domain is difficult, expensive, or downright infeasible.
In vision and robotics tasks, high levels of pose uncertainty may occur due to potentially adversarial conditions that arise in real-world scenarios.
 As an example, when we see a picture of a cat, we are not just able to tell that there is a cat in it, but also its position, its size, facts about the lighting conditions of the picture, and so forth.
 This is particularly relevant for inference on mobile or embedded devices with limited computational power.
 As this may be prohibitively expensive for large C, recent research has explored more scalable softmax approximations which circumvent the linear scaling in C.
Despite the great advancements of these methods, the exact results of many NAS papers are often hard to reproduce (Li & Talwalkar, 2019; Yu et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020).
 In order to have confidence in decisions made by such systems, it is necessary to obtain good uncertainty estimates, which quantify how certain the network is about a given output.
 Through these connections, RNNs can maintain a ”memory” that summarizes the past sequence of inputs, enabling it to capture correlations between temporally distant events in the data.
 As generative models aim to reproduce the true data distribution Pd by means of the model distribution Pg(z; Θ), more delicate evaluation procedures are needed.
 In addition to designing data pre-processing pipelines, other research efforts focus on neural architecture search (NAS)—a method to automatically generate novel architectures that are faster, more accurate and more compact.
 The binary all-or-nothing spike-based communication combined with sparse temporal processing precisely make SNNs a low-power alternative to conventional ANNs.
 This has motivated work on certifiably secure networks — classifiers that produce a label for an image, and also (when possible) a rigorous guarantee that the input is not adversarially manipulated (Cohen et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019b).
 For example, simultaneous models can translate live video captions or facilitate conversations between people speaking different languages.
 These features can be learned via either unsupervised learning using deep generative models (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Dumoulin et al., 2016), or self-supervised learning with “pretext” tasks and pseudo-labels (Noroozi & Favaro, 2016; Zhang et al., 2016; Gidaris et al., 2018), or transfer learning from another large-scale dataset (Yosinski et al., 2014; Oquab et al., 2014; Girshick et al., 2014).
 Second, CNNs are typically compute-intensive and memory-demanding, hindering their adoption to power-limited scenarios.
 That is,y = Axs + ε, (1)in which A ∈ Rm×n is an over-complete basis matrix.
 However, despite their practical popularity, theoretical research of graph NNs has not been explored extensively.
 There has been a significant amount of previous work done studying many aspects of graphs including link prediction Gao et al., (2011); Wang et al., (2011) and node prediction Blei et al., (2003).
 In response, a large literature has emerged on defending deep neural networks against adversarial examples, typically either proposing techniques for learning more robust neural network models (Wong & Kolter, 2018; Wong et al., 2018; Raghunathan et al., 2018b; Cohen et al., 2019; Madry et al., 2018), or by detecting adversarial inputs (Metzen et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018).
 (1)This expectation comes up in reinforcement learning, discrete latent variable modelling (e.g, for compression), structured prediction (e.g, for translation), hard attention and many other tasks that use models with discrete operations in their computational graphs (see e.g, Jang et al., (2016)).
 By combining temporal point process models with deep learning, we can design algorithms able to learn complex behavior from real-world data.
 This has been shown to be crucial for building very deep and powerful DNNs such as ResNet (He et al., 2016a;b), WideResNet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016), DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017) and ResNeXt (Xie et al., 2017).
 The bilingual parallel corpora with manual image annotations are used to train a multimodal NMT model by an end-to-end framework, and results are reported on a specific data set, Multi30K (Calixto & Liu, 2017; Calixto et al., 2017).
 In general, metric-based few-shot classification methods make the prediction based on the similarity between the query image and support examples.
 It is therefore desirable to continue to train the base computational model only on the new data/task and incrementally accumulate knowledge to improve the performance of the system over time, as opposed to retraining the model on the composition of old and new data.
 In settings that have historically had discrimination, we are interested in defining fairness with respect to a protected group, the group which has historically been disadvantaged.
One of the largest cold storage companies in the world is looking to improve the efficiency of their warehouses by optimizing the scheduling of storage systems.
 This approach is motivated by convolutional and recurrent neural networks and generalize both of them (Battaglia et al., 2018).
 In contrast, using batch normalization layers typically improves both generalization and convergence speed of deep neural networks (Luo et al., 2019; Bjorck et al., 2018).
 Feedforward processes group scenes by encoding increasingly more complex feature conjunctions through a cascade of filtering, rectification and normalization operations.
 The correlation effect complicates object recognition tasks and makes neural network training challenging, as adjacent pixels contain redundant information.
 In many cases, however, parallel corpora for the task at hand are scarce.
 One approach to creating these agents is to explicitly specify desired tasks and train a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to solve them.
 However, manually designing one architecture requires human experts to try numerous different operation and connection choices (Zoph & Le, 2017).
 Despite being an effective approach to transfer learning, few studies have generalized pre-training to graph data.
 As it has been one of the key milestone tasks in conversational research (Zhang et al., 2018), a majority of previous works have studied how to effectively combine given knowledge and dialogue context to generate an utterance (Zhang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019b; Parthasarathi & Pineau, 2018; Madotto et al., 2018; Gopalakrishnan et al., 2019).
 Networks specified using this API can have their infinite-width NNGP kernel and NTK evaluated analytically (§2.1, Listings 1, 2, 3, §B.2).
 Such applications oftentimes require the optimization of relatively low-dimensional (. 10D) functions where each function evaluation is expensive in either time or cost.
 There is no need to actually store the identity matrix in memory, it is trivial to reconstruct the row from the word identifier.
 On the one hand are methods like active learning and crowdconsensus learning that seek to reduce the cost of supervision in the form of per-instance labels.
 GNNs model the complex interactions between atoms by embedding each atom in a high-dimensional space and updating these embeddings by passing messages between atoms.
 The success of deep learning methods is mainly due to its flexibility, expression power and computational efficiency for large dataset training.
 Fortunately, the operations made in DNN training are highly suitable for parallelization over many devices.
 This changed with the recent breakthrough work by Khemakhem et al., (2019), which showed that under relatively mild conditions, it is possible to recover the joint data and latent space distribution, up to a simple transformation in the latent space.
 The class of structured linear maps includes fixed specialized transforms such as the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and Hadamard transform used in signal processing (Cooley et al., 1969), convolutions for image, language, and speech modeling (Gu et al., 2018), and low-rank and sparse matrices for efficient storage and inference on edge devices (Yu et al., 2017).
 As an illustrative example of the computational complexity of DNN training, one forward pass of the ResNet50 (He et al., (2016a)) model requires 4 GFLOPs (FLOPs: floating point operations) of computations and training requires 1018 FLOPs, which takes 14 days on one state-of-the-art NVIDIA M40 GPU (You et al., (2018)).
 Optimizers in deep learning are borrowed from the field of convex optimization , where momentum optimizers (Nesterov, 1983) and conjugate gradient methods provably solve ill-conditioned problems with high efficiency (Hestenes & Stiefel, 1952).
 The main ingredient is the “pretrain and fine-tune” approach, where a large text encoder is trained on an unlabeled corpus with self-supervised training objectives and used to initialize a task-specific model.
 The neighborhood is often defined as the set of adjacent nodes in graph.
 In many areas of machine learning, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are used to conduct approximate Bayesian inference by considering Markov chains whose equilibrium distribution is a desired posterior (Andrieu et al., 2002).
 Nevertheless, FL has three unique characters that distinguish it from the standard parallel optimization Li et al., (2019).
 Language generation models have seen remarkable advances in recent years, especially with the rapid development of deep neural networks (DNNs).
 When one requires robustness to adversarial examples, traditional model evaluation approaches, which test the trained model on a hold-out set, do not suffice.
 Many neural models are built from RNNs including the sequence-to-sequence family (Sutskever et al., 2014) and its attention-based branch (Bahdanau et al., 2014).
Currently, there is a large performance gap between the strongest generative modeling approach to downstream tasks of interest and hand-tailored solutions for each specific problem.
 This process can be done by iteratively computing and updating the state-action value function, represented by Q(s, a) (i.g,, the Q-value function).
 Indeed, recent research found the existing deep RL methods to be brittle (Henderson et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018), hard to reproduce (Henderson et al., 2017; Tucker et al., 2018), unreliable across runs (Henderson et al., 2017; 2018), and sometimes outperformed by simple baselines (Mania et al., 2018).
However, so far, most existing meta-learning approaches (Santoro et al., 2016; Vinyals et al., 2016; Snell et al., 2017; Ravi & Larochelle, 2017; Finn et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017) have only targeted an artificial scenario where all tasks participating in the multi-class classification problem have equal number of training instances per class.
 This sequence of bases can be represented asx := (x1, . , xL) where xi \\u2208 {A,G,C,U}, which is known as the primary structure of RNA.
In this paper, we consider the inverse problem setting where the target space Y is high-dimensional; for instance, consider the multi-label classification tasks of object tagging, text annotation, and image segmentation.
 The number of parameters exceeds 0.5B per layer in the largest configuration reported in (Shazeer et al., 2018) while the number of layers goes up to 64 in (Al-Rfou et al., 2018).
 Understanding these processes has boosted progress in many fields, ranging from physics to biology (Camazine et al., 2003).
 For some applications such as in medical decision making or autonomous driving, model interpretability is an important requirement with legal implications.
 A system that aims to truly understand a visual scene must accurately learn such grammars for all constituent objects - in effect, learning their aggregational structures.
 A notable limitation of these models is that they are difficult to parallelise over time: they predict each time step of an audio signal in sequence, which is computationally expensive and often impractical.
 This simple model specification allows NPs to be used for (i) meta-learning (Thrun & Pratt, 2012; Schmidhuber, 1987), since predictions can be generated on the fly from new context sets at test time; and (ii) multi-task or transfer learning (Requeima et al., 2019), since they provide a natural way of sharing information between data sets.
 Madry et al., (2018) instantiated adversarial training using a strong iterative adversary and showed that their approach can train models which are highly robust against the strongest known adversarial attacks such as Carlini & Wagner (2017).
 To address these concerns, federated learning is emerging (McMahan et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2017; Caldas et al., 2018; Bonawitz et al., 2019; Kairouz et al., 2019) as a paradigm that allows local clients to collaboratively train a shared global model.
 However, humans can quickly adapt their skills to a new task that requires similar priors e.g, physics, semantics, affordances to past experience.
 In certain domains, such as scientific discovery, it is often the case that scientists don’t have large amounts of labeled data and instead have to rely on prior knowledge to make sense of the data.
 In particular,• (reinforcement learning) The S × S system of Bellman equations Wang et al., (2017) can be written as minx∈RS ‖EBx− Eb‖2, where EB = I − γPπ , γ ∈ (0, 1) is a discount factor, Pπ is the transition probability under policy π, and Eb is the expected state transition reward.
 For instance, and in an attempt to uncover the expressive power of DNNs, Montufar et al., (2014) studied the complexity of functions computable by DNNs that have piecewise linear activations.
 Many control problems in partially observed 3D environments involve long term dependencies and planning.
 A standard way to increase robustness is to inject adversarial examples into the training inputs (Goodfellow et al., 2014a).
 Unfortunately, on the one hand, maintaining the quality of semantic labels as the scale of training data increases is expensive and almost impossible when the scale becomes excessively large.
 In the case of deep learning, where neural networks tend to have several orders of magnitude more parameters than training examples, statistical learning theory (Vapnik & Chervonenkis, 1971) indicates that regularization becomes even more crucial.
 Monte Carlo gradient estimation is an effective solution where, instead of computing the true gradients, one can sample gradients from some distribution.
 RP Tree is used to randomly partition a set of data points in a space into several disjoint subsets.
 For example in image and voice data, one can leverage domain properties such as location invariance, scale invariance, coherence, etc. via using convolutional layers (Goodfellow et al., 2016).
 However, in many real-world applications AI systems are not only expected to perform well but are also required to be interpretable: doctors need to understand why a particular treatment is recommended, and financial institutions need to understand why a loan was declined.
 However, collecting such large-scale and high-quality datasets is costly and challenging.
 Since then, various Neural Style Transfer (NST) Jing et al., (2017) methods have been advanced and obtained visually pleasing results.
 To add the localization functionality to generic object detection systems, sliding window approaches have been the method of choice for many years (Lampert et al., 2008; Felzenszwalb et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2018).
 Topologically, the architecture of a network can be expressed as a direct acyclic graph, whose nodes denote the transformation of layers and edges represent information flow.
 Specifically, by injecting a small perturbation to a normal sample, one can obtain an adversarial example.
 While large audio datasets have greatly improved supervised training, the collection and especially the cleaning of a large amount of audio data still remain an open challenge (Fonseca et al., 2017).
 Some methods exploit maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) (Gretton et al., 2008; Long et al., 2015) or other distribution statistics like central moments (Sun & Saenko, 2016; Zellinger et al., 2017; Koniusz et al., 2017) for domain adaptation.
 In the case of learning to manipulate objects, a human agent not only attempts to accomplish the task but also learns to master the controllable aspects of the environment (Lake et al., 2017).
 These methods leverage patterns across similar users and items, predicting user preferences and demonstrating encouraging results in recommendation tasks Bennett & Lanning (2007); Hu et al., (2008); Schedl (2016).
 Another major research area is the exploration of network architecture and its impact on performance.
 Such analysis gives a clear indication that even state-of-the-art DNNs may lack robustness.
 Such perturbations are best known and commonly referred to as adversarial attacks.
 Not only are these findings surprising given the widespread assumption that NNs only learn highly distributed and entangled representations, they raise a host of questions, including the functional importance of these selective representations (Zhou et al., 2018b), the conditions in which they are learned (e.g, Morcos et al., 2018), and the relation between these representations and the selective neurons observed in cortex (Bowers, 2009).
Spiking Neuron Networks(SNNs) (Maass, 1997), with inspiration for the propagation of the cortex neurons (Perrett et al., 1982; Tuckwell, 1988), have been presented continuous attention as a new, power-efficient and hardware friendly technology.
 WeightNorm was proposed as a method that emulates BatchNorm and benefits from similar stability and convergence properties.
 High-dimensional information about neighbors of nodes are represented by dense vectors, which can be fed to off-the-shelf approaches to tasks, such as node classification (Wang et al., (2017); Bhagat et al., (2011)), link prediction (Perozzi et al., (2014); Wei et al., (2017)), node clustering (Nie et al., (2017); Ding et al., (2001)), recommender systems (Ying et al., (2018a)) and visualization (Maaten & Hinton (2008)).
 One recent and promising direction for compressing CNN is depthwise separable convolution (Sifre (2014)) which replaces standard convolution with depthwise and pointwise convolutions.
 In this work, we analyse algorithms for variational inference, i.g,algorithms which aim to1. learn the generative model, i.g,find a value θ? which is approximately equal to the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE) θml := arg maxθ pθ(x);2. construct a tractable variational approximation qφ,x(z) of pθ(z|x) = pθ(z, x)/pθ(x), i.g,find the value φ? such that qφ?,x(z) is as close as possible to pθ(z|x) in some suitable sense.
 However, since most state-of-the-art CNNs require expensive computation power for inference and huge storage space to store large amount of parameters, the limitation of energy, computation and storage on mobile or edge devices has become the major bottleneck on real-world deployments of CNNs.
 For practical applications such as autonomous driving, there is a high demand for real-time processing and sufficient training data.
 SGD has two main advantages: not only is it simple to implement, but it can also be applied in online settings where new coming training data are used to train models.
 However, using simulated scenes for training might lack details since a synthetic image will not be photorealistic and will lack the variability and randomness of real images, causing training to succeed up to a certain point.
 Human’s audible frequency range is up to 20 kHz, so the standard sampling rate for music and sound is 44.1 kHz.
 In their conventional form, deep neural networks are considered as black-box models – they are controlled by complex nonlinear interactions between many parameters that are difficult to understand.
 Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR), as a special case of MFSR, has attracted much attention in the computer vision, machine learning and deep learning communities in the last 5 years, with neural networks learning complex image priors to upsample and interpolate images (Xu et al., 2014; Srivastava et al., 2015; He et al., 2016).
 However, devising a good partitioning and placement of the dataflow graphs requires deep understanding of the model architecture, optimizations performed by domain-specific compilers, as well as the device characteristics, and is therefore extremely hard even for experts.
 One of the popular tasks that encompasses these applications is graph classification problem for which many graph kernels and graph neural networks have been developed.
 They are top-performing models in language translation (Sutskever et al., 2014), visual recognition (He et al., 2016), and decision making (Silver et al., 2018).
 Multiple model instances can be aggregated to obtain robust uncertainty estimates over the network’s predictions; uncertainty estimates are crucial in domains such as medical diagnosis and autonomous driving where following a model’s incorrect predictions can result in catastrophe (Kendall & Gal, 2017).
 In order to achieve higher accuracy using a network with similar complexity as the base network, distillation has been proposed, which aims to utilize the prediction of one (teacher) network to guide the training of another (student) network.
 This includes for instance generative models (VAE, GAN...), clustering techniques and, in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, all recent contextual words embeddings (RoBERTa, XLNet, GPT-2…).
 GP inference considers the calculation of the posterior of these function values (Matthews et al., 2016) given observations, namely p(f |y).
 Despite the fact that there exist various learning algorithms (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Pennington et al., 2014; Bojanowski et al., 2017) for producing high-quality distributed representations of words, the main objective is roughly the same, which is drawn from the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1954).
 Methods such as SIFT feature matching (Lowe, 2004) combined with RANSAC (Fischler & Bolles, 1981) have been the standard for decades.
 State-of-the-art neural networks often have many layers, which means they have a lot of parameters to learn, leading to practical issues including long training time and high risk of overfitting.
 Specifically, cubic regularization forms a cubic surrogate function for the objective F (x) by adding a third-order regularization term to the second-order Taylor expansion, and minimizes it iteratively.
 To prevent negative transfer, researchers have sought ways to allow knowledge transfer only among closely related tasks, by either identifying the task groups or learning optimal sharing structure among task (Duong et al., 2015; Misra et al., 2016).
 This architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many tasks including language modeling (Dai et al., 2019; Al-Rfou et al., 2018) and machine translation (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dehghani et al., 2018; Edunov et al., 2018).
 BatchNorm is widely-used in DNN due to that it is able to reduce the sensitivity to initialization, significantly raise the learning rate, substantially speed up the training process and considerably improve the performance.
 A motivating example is a task called domain generalization (Blanchard et al., 2011), which requires learning a domain-invariant representation that applies to unseen domains (e.g, the data of an unseen user or different image sources).
 Depending on the manufacturer, these robots will differ in their kinematics (e.g, link length, joint orientations) and dynamics (e.g, link mass, joint damping, friction, inertia).
 Our central aim is to demonstrate the usefulness of CNN-based evaluations in the context of numerical simulations.
 One problem in the application of GNN to molecular datasets is the difficulty in reducing the training loss.
 A common way to learn the mapping is to define a loss function based on triplets of images: an anchor image, a positive image from the same class, and a negative image from a different class.
 The resulting models, however, are known to have poor grounding performance (Liu et al., 2017), leading to undesirable behaviors such as object hallucinations (Rohrbach et al., 2018), despite having high captioning accuracy.
 For instance, grid-based simulations generate a physical scalar or vector field which can been compared to multidimensional arrays in computer vision.
On the one hand, private models, trained with existing privacy-preserving mechanisms (Abadi et al., 2016; Shokri & Shmatikov, 2015; Phan et al., 2016; 2017b;a; Yu et al., 2019; Lee & Kifer, 2018), are unshielded under adversarial examples.
 This approach has demonstrated significant relevance gains in a wide range of applications and outperforms existing term matching baselines, such as web search (Huang et al., 2013; Zamani et al., 2018b), question and answering (Yu et al., 2014), ad-hoc retrieval (Mitra et al., 2017; Dehghani et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2016), mobile search (Aliannejadi et al., 2018), and product search (Van Gysel et al., 2016).
 However, how to understand the expressive power of RNN in a quantitative way is not fully understood.
 The process of recognizing mathematical expressions is to convert mathematical expressions into LaTeX strings, which includes three stages: symbol segmentation, symbol recognition and structural analysis.
 One inherent reason that leads to the inferior performance of the conventional approaches in sparse reward domains is that initially, the agent trained with those approaches could hardly stumble into a reward/goal state by chance due to their simple exploration strategies (Pathak et al., 2017).
 Although shallow networks cannot ensure high accuracy, DNNs composed of too many layers may suffer from over-fitting and convergence difficulty in training.
 To achieve good inference results, these models typically comprise hundreds of layers and contain tens of millions of parameters and consequently, consume substantial amounts of computational resources for both training and inference.
 However, this type of approach does not provide a gradient with respect to the heatmap, and cannot be directly integrated into neural network-based systems.
 This phenomenon, referred to as adversarial attack, is considered to be one of the biggest threats to the deployment of many deep learning systems.
 On datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10, AT has achieved the state-of-the-art defense performance against `p-norm-ball input perturbations (Athalye et al., 2018b).
 However when the network is retrained on a new task, its performance drops drastically on previously trained tasks, a phenomenon which is referred to as catastrophic forgetting (Ratcliff, 1990; Robins, 1995; French, 1999; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017).
 In lifelong learning, neural networks are equipped with the capability to learn new tasks while maintaining the performance on the tasks trained previously.
 This property is crucial for many vision tasks such as image recognition and segmentation.
 It is particularly challenging to deploy, in a naive manner, such large ConvNets on edge device that with limited memory and compute capacities.
 Knowing the exact original location and destination of each future trip allows platforms to prepare sufficient supplies in advance to optimize resource utilization and improve users’ experience.
 Hence, improving the sample efficiency of the learning algorithm is a key problem in RL and has been studied extensively in the literature.
Recently, variational Bayesian approaches have shown to be useful for network sparsification, outperforming non-Bayesian counterparts.
 The most well-known clustering algorithm is the k-means, whose objective is to minimize the sum of squared distances to their closest centroids.
 A popular class of invertible models is the flow-based generative models (Dinh et al., 2017; Rezende & Mohamed, 2015; Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018; Grathwohl et al., 2018) that employ a change of variables to transform a simple distribution into more complicated ones while preserving the invertibility and exact likelihood estimation.
 Recent works have used this framework to achieve impressive feats such as learning to classify using one labeled image per class (Snell et al., 2017; Finn et al., 2017), learning unsupervised update rules that generalize to different domains (Metz et al., 2018), and accelerating training procedures that are millions of steps long (Flennerhag et al., 2018).
 For example, the BigGAN model (Brock et al., 2018), developed by Google, contains up to 0.2 TOPs in the inference phase and its model size is over 1.3 GB.
A GAN consists of two neural networks: a discriminator and a generator.
 Thus, they come at the cost of interpretability (Jain & Wallace, 2019).
 In recent years, deep learning has been frequently used in text classification.
 Training GANs will improve the two networks’ capability synchronously.
 However, many medical tests are either harmful or inconvenient to perform frequently, and practitioners have to infer the development of disease from sparse, noisy observations.
 Learning such a priori assumptions in a purely data-driven manner is inefficient and, in some situations, may not be feasible at all.
 Indeed, previous theories have suggested how powerful RL rules inspired by artificial neural networks could be implemented in the brain (Roelfsema & Holtmaat, 2018) and the methodology for shaping neural networks with rewards and punishments is an active area of research (Schmidhuber et al., 2011; Friedrich et al., 2010; Vasilaki et al., 2009; O’Reilly & Frank, 2006; Huang et al., 2013).
 model-based policy optimization algorithms which learn policies or Q-functions, parameterized by neural networks, on the estimated dynamics, using off-the-shelf model-free algorithms or their variants (Luo et al., 2019; Janner et al., 2019; Kaiser et al., 2019; Kurutach et al., 2018; Feinberg et al., 2018; Buckman et al., 2018), and 2.
 Therefore, I2I translation has recently received significant attention in the literature.
 While neural encoder-decoder models have achieved impressive performance in many text generation tasks (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Vaswani et al., 2017; Chorowski et al., 2015; Chopra et al., 2016), it is appealing to design image captioning models where structural bias can be injected to improve their adequacy (preservation of the image’s information), therefore strengthening the link between their language and vision components.
 The differential equation is then reduced to a system of algebraic equations.
 Under adversarial attacks, ASR systems will recognize the audio inputs as intelligible voice commands, while humans perceive the audio inputs differently.
 It also determines how close we get to the minima, e.g, higher learning rates may get in the neighborhood of a minima much faster, but then just bounce at a height above the minima (Xing et al., (2018); Nar & Sastry (2018)).
 However, large scale graphs such as social network graphs and web graphs contain billions of nodes, and even a linear time computation cost per iteration is prohibited.
 At each step t in 1, T , the learner chooses an arm i and receives a reward Xt from the choice under the purpose to minimize the regret as well as maximize cumulative reward.
 Research topics such as transfer learning and domain adaptation are studied to promote invariant representations across domains with different levels of availabilities of annotated data.
 It is also unavoidable that some data is very hard to retrieve.
 Over the years, while new labeling paradigms have emerged to alleviate this issue (e.g, crowdsourcing (Deng et al., 2009) or external information sources (Abu-El-Haija et al., 2016)), these methods have also highlighted, and emphasized, the prevalence of label noise.
A graph data structure represents objects as nodes and relations between objects as edges.
For example, patients from one hospital may have a different distribution of gender, height and weight from another hospital.
Even when a large language model is pretrained on large amounts of multilingual data (Devlin et al., 2018; Lample & Conneau, 2019), languages like English can contain orders of magnitude more data in common sources for pretraining like Wikipedia.
At inference time, malicious users can evade detection of multiple models in the form of adversarial example attacks (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016; 2018a).
 There is also great interest in continual learning from a longer-term perspective, in that any approach towards artificial general intelligence needs to be able to continuously build on top of prior experiences.
 Thus, the compression of large neural networks and the development of novel lightweight architectures have become essential problems in NLP research.
 This is mainly due to their feed forward structure, which removes the sequential processing bottleneck for sequence data, making them easier to train compared to the recurrent models.
 However, these neural models are sometimes viewed as less interpretable or controllable than more traditional models composed of multiple stages of processing that each operate on reified linguistic or phonetic representations.
 For example, auto-regressive models for text generation factorize the joint probability left-to-right.
 Word embedding models, such as skip-gram with negative sampling (SGNS) (Mikolov et al., 2013b) or GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), capture some analogic relations, such as−−→ king −−−→man + −−−−−→woman ≈ −−−→queen.
 Though a well-tuned SGD outperforms adaptive methods (Wilson et al., 2017) in many traditional tasks including ImageNet classification (see Figure 1b), certain tasks necessitate the use of adaptive variants of SGD (e.g, Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011), Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014), AMSGrad (Reddi et al., 2019)), which employ adaptive perparameter learning rates.
 A very exciting and important future avenue for generative models is the generation of 3-D structures, like in the world around us.
 However, PLMs usually have an extremely large number of parameters and need long inference time, which are difficult to be deployed on edge devices such as mobile phones.
 A new area of research, neural architecture search (NAS), seeks to automate this process.
Among the efforts of improving CNNs’ efficiency, weight quantization was shown to be an effective technique (Zhou et al., (2016; 2017); Hou & Kwok (2018); Ding et al., (2019)).
 Yet at this point there is a very small number of attributes which are of importance: the type of the charging animal, its approximate velocity and its location.
 The most dominant generative models are Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014), as they have exhibited impressive performance in generating high quality images (Radford et al., 2015; Brock et al., 2018) and in other vision tasks (Zhu et al., 2017; Ledig et al., 2017).
 Recent reinforcement learning approaches (Peng et al., 2018) struggle to generate diverse motion.
 There are two purposes of the deep network.
 Therefore, cross-lingual embeddings can serve a variety of downstream tasks such as bilingual lexicon induction, cross-lingual information retrieval, machine translation and many applications of zero-shot transfer learning, which is particularly impactful from resource-rich to low-resource languages.
 Compared with generation tasks for images or natural language, graph generation tasks are significantly more difficult; this is due to the necessity of modeling complex local/global dependencies among nodes and edges as well as the intractable properties of graphs themselves, such as discreteness, variable number of nodes and edges, and uncertainty of node ordering.
 As this Machine Learning-as-a-Service model starts to grow, it becomes easier to find these APIs as an integral component of more complex products.
 This approach usually demands considerable computation power — each search process takes days with hundreds of GPUs.
Recently, Brock et al., (2018) substantially improved the results of Zhang et al., (2018) by using very large mini-batches during training.
 Particularly in today’s computer vision problems, total variation (TV) (Guichard & Malgouyres, 1998; Vogel & Oman, 1998), low-rank representation (Liu et al., 2013; Ji et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017), and non-local similarity (Buades et al., 2005; Dabov et al., 2007) priors are often used for image modeling.
 For example, in online forum, each discussion thread can be constructed as a graph where nodes represent users and edges represent commenting activities between users (Yanardag & Vishwanathan, 2015).
 For optimization, over-parameterization may simplify the landscape of empirical risks toward locating global optima efficiently by gradient descent method (Mei et al., 2018; 2019; Venturi et al., 2018; Allen-Zhu et al., 2018; Du et al., 2018).
 Designing a neural network architecture requires expert-level efforts to specify the key network hyper-parameters, such as type of layers, number of filters and layers (i.g,, network width and depth) and so on.
In particular, many policy gradient methods are subject to use as much experience as possible in the most efficient way.
 Even though many works have been done to develop language-processing tools, they are mainly concentrated on English, European and East-Asian languagesNivre (2013).
 Here, there is a patient and a clinician which acts to improve the patient’s health.
 Nevertheless, there are circumstances where this method may not apply.
In complex industrial environments (such as aviation, internal combustion engines, chemical engineering, etc.), it is of great research significance to detect faults and defects in closed chambers.
Molecular graph generation is one of the hot trends in the graph analysis with a potential for important applications such as in silico new material discovery and drug candidate screening.
 Among these, separable convolution and structured pruning are similar, in that separable convolution can be viewed as convolutions pruned in a handcrafted manner.
A well-known hurdle in the ability to train deep networks, is the effect of depth on the magnitude of the gradients.
One of the most theoretically appealing stochastic neural network formulations is Bayesian neural networks, which place a prior distribution on the weights of the network (Graves, 2011; Blundell et al., 2015; Ritter et al., 2018).
We introduce the task of Any-Code-to-Code Generation (AnyC2C) – generating source code in a general-purpose programming language without any restriction on its vocabulary or structure.
 Similarly, the NLU subtasks that are part of the SentEval framework, a widely used benchmark for the evaluation of sentence-to-vector encoders, are successfully dealt with by current neural models, with scores that exceed the 90% mark.
 Since traditional machine learning assumes a model is trained and verified in a fixed distribution (single domain), where generalization performance is guaranteed by VC theory (N.
 In this context, we understand the time-discretized żt as parameterisation of an (unknown) transformation function f such that xt+1 = f(xt, żt) = f(xt, zt+1 − zt), where zt are unobserved feature-vectors.
 One may wish to predict future outcomes of unseen matches, and also to rank alternatives in order of utility or preference.
 Let us consider the class of machine learning problems where the inputs are compressible (i.g,, approximately sparse) in some domain.
Reconstruction error usually drives the definition of the latent representation learned from an AE or VAE.
 Deep and wide networks cost a large number of computation as well as memory storage which is not suitable for a resource-limited environment such as mobile or embedded systems.
 However, it is found these powerful models are susceptible to perturbations, even those imperceptible to humans (Szegedy et al., 2013).
 To bridge the domain gap, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) transfers the knowledge learned from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain by statistical distribution alignment (Long et al., 2015; Tzeng et al., 2014a) or adversarial alignment (Tzeng et al., 2017; Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015a; Saito et al., 2018).
 A challenging task is to learn a probability distribution over such relational structures from one or few examples.
 Arguably, the most scalable way to collect a large amount of training samples is to crowdsource from a decentralized population of agents who hold relevant sample information.
 Recent work has shown that the model learned from training data may leak unintended information of individual records (Fredrikson et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016; Shokri et al., 2017; Hitaj et al., 2017).
 Many of these tasks are solved by deep neural networks used within decision making pipelines which require the machine learning block not only to predict the target but to also output its confidence in the prediction.
 Reinforcement Learning (RL) is at the forefront of this development, especially when combined with deep neural networks in DRL.
 In medicine, using a high dosage of a drug can lead to toxic effects while using a low dosage can result in no effect on the patient outcome (Wang et al., 2017).
 These innovations are introduced at such a rapid pace (Dean et al., 2018; arXiv ML Papers Statistics) that researchers are hard-pressed to study and compare them.
 Example approaches are transfer learning (Wang & Gupta, 2015), unsupervised representation learning (Wang & Gupta, 2015), semi-supervised learning (Weston et al., 2008), learning from noisy labels (Joulin et al., 2016) and few-shot learning (Snell et al., 2017).
 Policy gradient methods (Williams, 1992; Sutton et al., 2000) are powerful algorithms to learn the optimal policy.
 Given the input variable X and the desired output Y for a supervised learning task, a DNN is viewed as a transformation of X into a representation that is favorable for obtaining a good prediction of Y .
 To protect user privacy, it is desirable to train personalized models in a privacy-preserving way, for example, using Federated Learning (McMahan et al., 2016; Konen et al., 2016b).
 Good generalization is essential for problems such as robotics and autonomous vehicles, where the agent is often trained in a simulator and is then deployed in the real world where novel conditions will certainly be encountered.
 While the perturbations remain almost imperceptible to humans, they can lead to wrong predictions over the perturbed examples (Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Akhtar & Mian, 2018).
 Recently, learning based methods have shown great potential in solving image processing problems.
 Attacks exploit this property by altering pixels the classifier heavily relies on – pixels which are irrelevant to humans for object recognition.
 In our application scenario, we define the point of wheel contacting with the ground as the keypoint in the vehicle instance.
Adaptive methods (Duchi et al., 2011; Zeiler, 2012; Hinton et al., 2012; Kingma & Ba, 2014; Ma & Yarats, 2018) sought to simplify the training process, while providing similar performance.
With regard to solving these problems, Howard et al., (2017); Sandler et al., (2018); Zhang et al., (2017b); Ma et al., (2018) proposed parameter and computation efficient blocks while maintaining almost same accuracy compared to other heavy CNN models.
 The architecture of the DNN, hyper-parameters of the training process, and distribution of the dataset used are all crucial ingredients that impact the final performance of the DNN.
 Actually, humans are exceptional experts at learning abstract knowledge from unsupervised data, i.g,, without knowing the specific labels of the data.
 We address the problem via metric learning approach, where instances with the more different labels move the further away.
 These methods are not only popular among academicians, but are also a crucial component in a wide range of applications, including image editing (Isola et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2017), super-resolution (Ledig et al., 2017), video generation (Wang et al., 2018) and many others.
 This is in stark contrast to the more traditional information theoretical divergences, which rely on only comparing the difference in mass assignment.
 Such time series are important for advanced investigation and also are useful for future forecasting.
 Recent years have witnessed many studies exploring the paradigm of learning from demonstration (LfD), which provides the learner with some demonstration data generated by expert policies.
However, this remarkable multi-task learning method suffers from a common problem of modern detection methods.
 As a practical model compression scheme, parameter quantization is a popular choice because compression ratio is high and regular formats after compression enable full memory bandwidth utilization that is crucial in highly parallel computing systems.
 Zoph and Le (2017) presented the first modern algorithm automating structure design, and showed that resulting architectures can indeed outperform human-designed state-of-the-art convolutional networks (Ko, 2019; Liu et al., 2019).
 It has been observed that they can provide predictions with high confidence values for errors (Guo et al., 2017), out-of-distribution (OOD) examples such as tailored noise (Nguyen et al., 2015) and adversarial examples (Szegedy et al., 2014).
 For instance, it may be impossible to observe the data during a given time window, the data-recording system may fail, or measurements may be recognized as noisy and immediately discarded at the source.
 The goal of the agent is to maximize the expected cumulative rewards over T rounds.
 For example, a defect in a DL-based autonomous driving system resulted in the death of one pedestrian (Amir, 2018).
 As such, their conditional variants (cGANs) would appear to be the natural tool for conditional image generation as well, and they have successfully been applied in many scenarios (Ledig et al., 2017; Miyato & Koyama, 2018).
 These techniques are commonly applied to pre-trained state-of-the-art models, yet they can also be used to explore the effects of various architectural choices on the learned representations.
 However, there exist significant disadvantages in the point cloud data.
 Extractive models select sentences from the input article as the summary.
 A neural network that is trained exclusively on a new task’s data forgets past knowledge and suffers from an early identified phenomenon commonly referred to as catastrophic forgetting (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989).
 In particular, recent works Kim & Mnih (2018); Chen et al., (2018) focused on a term called total correlation (TC).
 However, in many scenarios, although it is easy to acquire a large amount of the original data, obtaining corresponding labels is often very costly or even infeasible.
 We prove that high confidence values imply a high probability of correct classification on test sets.
 Since the length of the learning experience is not specified a-priori, the learner can only assume a single pass over the data, and store nothing but a few examples into a fixed-size episodic memory.
 Despite recent advances on representation learning, it was shown that deep convolutional neural networks (CNN’s) have a tendency to learn superficial statistics of data associated with given tasks, rather than important generative factors embedded in the physical world Jo & Bengio (2017); Goodfellow et al., (2014).
 A common approach to circumvent these issues is to transfer models trained in simulation to the real world (Tobin et al., 2017; Rusu et al., 2016; Held et al., 2017).
 For this purpose we propose to extend the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014; Dzmitry Bahdanau, 2014; Luong et al., 2015) to translate signal wave x (continuous time-series signals) into other signal wave y.
 Indyk (1999) provides a list of other computational problems such as nearest neighbor search, (approximate) proximity problems, facility location, and a variety of graph problems for which we have efficient approximation algorithms in a general metric space.
 Notably, it is considered as a major component in the design of AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), which won the prominent ImageNet challenge in 2012 with a significant margin and helped transform the field of computer vision.
 Previous work has attempted to create strategies to handle this sensitivity by selecting subsets of the data to train the model on (Jiang & Zhai, 2007; Wang et al.,; Axelrod et al., 2011; Moore & Lewis, 2010), providing different weights for each example (Sivasankaran et al., 2017; Ren et al., 2018), or changing the presentation order of data (Bengio et al., 2009; Kumar et al., 2019).
 Most of the current datasets for question-answering focus on the ability to read and extract information from a single piece of text, often composed of few sentences (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2016).
 This gap motivated progress in few-shot learning (FSL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL).
 Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer has shown promising results for rapidly building applications for low resource languages.
 End-to-end learning promises a way to deal flexibly with the complexity of the physical, visual and linguistic world without relying on (potentially brittle) hand-crafted features, rules or policies.
 The earlier approaches for DR involve linear methods such as PCA (Pearson, 1901).
 In supervised learning, these features are learned implicitly through minimizing the empirical error Eemp(f, S) = 1/|S| ∑ (x,y)∈S `(f(x), y) for a training set S ⊂ X × Y drawn iid according to a target distribution D : X × Y → 0, 1, and a loss function ` : Y × Y → R+.
 Abadi et al., (2016) introduced an algorithm for differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), which made it feasible to scale differential privacy guarantees to neural networks.
 Our lack of understanding of this important phenomenon is in large part due to the difficulty of modeling complex decision making processes on social networks.
In supervised learning, a pre-trained network significantly reduces sample complexity when learning new tasks (Zeiler & Fergus, 2013; Devlin et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019).
Although both methods can capture aspects of the semantics pertaining to the temporal dependencies in a video clip, there is a fundamental difference in how 3D CNNs treat time compared to C-LSTMs.
The model has to quickly learn (or adapt) a classifier given this very limited amount of learning signal.
 Metagenomics is a subfield of biology, which is concerned with the study of genetic material found in samples taken directly from the environment (Consortium et al., 2016; Howe et al., 2014).
 The main reason dithering is important to our problem can be traced to a fundamental result in the study of lattices in information theory called the Crypto-Lemma (see Zamir & Feder (1996), G.D. Forney (2004)) which to our knowledge, had not been used before to optimize, with gradient techniques, computational networks that employ quantization in a provably correct way.
 Graph neural networks (GNNs) (Kipf & Welling, 2016; Veličković et al., 2018) have gained tremendous attention in the data science community.
Conventionally, semantic parsing has been done with a two step approach: first, a large number of potential candidates are generated using deterministic methods and combinatorial search (the generator), and then the best candidate is selected among them with a probabilistic method or scoring (the critic) (Berant & Liang, 2014; Kwiatkowski et al., 2013; Zettlemoyer & Collins, 2005; Berant et al., 2013; Cai & Yates, 2013).
 More realistically, models can learn to exploit the abundance of input-target correlations present in datasets, not all of which may be invariant under different environments.
 At the t-th iteration, distributed synchronous SGD updates the model parameters byxt+1 = xt − ηt 1P P∑ p=1 gpt , (1)where gpt ∈ Rd is the stochastic gradient with its locally selected data for the loss function fp(x) : Rd → R and ηt is the learning rate.
 On the contrary, MBRL approaches, by trying model the transition dynamics that are in turn used for planning without having to frequently interacting with real systems, are known to have sample efficiency and thus possess more practicability (Deisenroth et al., 2013; Finn et al., 2016; Ebert et al., 2018; Sutton & Barto, 2018; Kaiser et al., 2019).
 Since the size of the search space increases exponentially with the length of expressions, current search methods can only scale to find expressions of limited length.
 However, they were shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples that are generated by adding carefully crafted perturbations to original images.
 Variational Inference (VI) (Jordan et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2018) approximates the intractable target distribution through optimization of a tractable distribution.
 In an open world environment (Bendale & Boult, 2015), where examples from novel class distributions might appear during test time, it is necessary to build classifiers that are able to detect OOD examples while having high classification accuracy on known class distributions.
 In this paper, we study why SGD is so efficient at converging to low loss values on most standard neural networks, and how neural net architecture design affects training performance.
 The recent works in SSL are diverse but those that are based on consistency training (Bachman et al., 2014; Rasmus et al., 2015; Laine & Aila, 2016; Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017) have shown to work well on many benchmarks.
 In recent work, the ability to interpolate – i.g,to achieve near zero loss on all training samples simultaneously – has been used to show convergence of SGD (Ma et al., 2018, Vaswani et al., 2019a, Zhou et al., 2019).
The number of Earth observing satellites is constantly increasing, with currently over 700 satellites monitoring many aspects of the Earth’s surface and atmosphere from space, generating terabytes of imagery data every day.
 For this reason, much prior work on video generation has revolved around relatively simple datasets, or tasks where strong temporal conditioning information is available.
 Adversarial examples can also fool systems when they are printed out on a paper and photographed with a smart phone (Kurakin et al., 2016a).
 While this makes multi-task learning appealing for its potential performance improvements, there are also benefits in terms of resource efficiency.
 Since RL agents cannot quickly transfer policies, the agent is forced to learn every task from scratch, which is both time and sample expensive.
 Integrated with simple decision-making layers, these canonical architectures yield high performance on new datasets and related tasks with small extra tuning effort.
 Existing NAS methods use only the standard feature learning/transformation operations (convolution, pooling and identity mapping) as the building components.
 Consider, for example, laborious tasks such as image annotation, audio transcription, or natural language part-of-speech tagging.
 Instead, a formalism capable of expressing the relations in terms of hierarchical constituents ought to be necessary.
 Thus, it is straightforward to extend the local feature aggregation used in the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (Atwood & Towsley, 2016; Bruna et al., 2014; Fey et al., 2018; Gilmer et al., 2017; Niepert et al., 2016; Simonovsky & Komodakis, 2017; Zhang et al., 2018).
 To address this, a deep learning practitioner may suggest training DNNs with datasets that are not only big but also diverse.
 To bridge this gap, tools from different fields, such as statistical mechanics, partial differential equations, dynamics systems, have been brought into use.
 Such solvers (for example, the Boltzmann Transport Equation solver) are often complex, expensive to evaluate, and offer no access to their inner variables or their gradients.
 However, the current paradigm in atmospheric CFD is purely physicsdriven: known physical laws encoded in systems of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) are solved over space and time via numerical differentiation and integration schemes.
 We elaborate on the intuitive idea that similar tasks should allow a large amount of transfer.
 Similarly, in extreme classification tasks (Dean et al., 2013), MIPS is used to predict the class label when a large number of classes, often on the order of millions or even billions are involved.
 When trained with stochastic gradient descent, DNNs learn patterns first before memorizing the label noise (Arpit et al., 2017).
 Since accessing and storing all the facts in the world is difficult, knowledge bases are incomplete; the goal of link prediction (or knowledge completion) in knowledge (hyper)graphs is to predict unknown links or relationships between entities based on the existing ones.
 The threat posed by adversarial attacks must be addressed before these methods can be deployed in error-sensitive and security-based applications (Potember, 2017).
 The activation is constructed by the weights which contain specific knowledge learned from training samples.
 This information, frequently referred to as node attributes or node metadata, can contain information that is useful for prediction tasks including demographic, geo-spatial, and/or textual features.
 There is always an infinite set of possible questions that one can ask, leading to challenges both in representing the space of questions and in searching for the right question to ask.
 However, collecting annotations for parallel data is highly time-consuming.
 A popular framework for MARL is the use of a Centralized Training and a Decentralized Execution (CTDE) procedure (Lowe et al., 2017; Foerster et al., 2018; Iqbal & Sha, 2019; Foerster et al., 2019; Rashid et al., 2018).
 As the number of safety- and privacy-critical applications is increasing, e.g, autonomous driving or medical imaging, this problem becomes even more important.
 Meanwhile, various defense methods were proposed to enhance the robustness of DNNs against adversarial attacks.
 In these works, sequences of neighboring nodes are generated from random walks over a network, and representations are distilled from extracted node-node proximity statistics that capture local neighbourhood information.
 However, the resulting sequence models are often exceedingly large.
In this work, we focus on flagging test examples that do not contain any of the classes modeled in the train distribution.
 This has led to many of the recent advances in deep graph generative models where some of these approaches are domain dependent models (Kusner et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2018) for generating graphs with physical constrains, while some others consider the generation of generic graphs (Li et al., 2018; Samanta et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2018a).
While learning algorithms have been continuously improving, it is undeniable that tree search methods have played a large role in some of the most successful applications of RL (e.g, AlphaZero 42, Mario 10 and Arcade games 48).
 In particular, the vision community has shown that the semantic context, namely the correlations among the objects, helps object detection Rabinovich et al., (2007).
 In recent years, deep neural networks based autoregressive models have attained state-of-the-art results, including highfidelity audio synthesis (van den Oord et al., 2016), and much simpler sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) pipelines (Sotelo et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017; Ping et al., 2018b).
 This information is useful in a variety of NLP tasks such as question answering, knowledge base population, and semantic search (Jiang, 2012).
 Therefore, there has been a growing interest to automatically learn (or meta-learn) the architecture of neural networks that can achieve competitive (or better) results over hand-designed architectures.
 To design adversarial attacks, most work has focused on creating either imperceptible input perturbations (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Papernot et al., 2016a; Carlini & Wagner, 2017; Chen et al., 2018) or adversarial patches robust to the physical environment (Eykholt et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2017; Athalye et al., 2017).
 However, it is non-trivial to train a deep generative model that can converge to a proper minimum of the associated optimization.
 On the one hand, adversarial examples are named as such because they as able to trick a deep network using changes imperceptible to humans.
 From a human perspective, it is hard to understand how features are extracted from different hidden layers and what features are used for final decision making.
While using a large number of learned filters in CNNs creates high-quality features, it also requires significant computational resources.
 Adversarial attacks include white-box attacks, where the attack method has full access to models, and black-box attacks, where the attacks do not need knowledge of models structures and weights.
 However, labeling this data remains very costly and often requires domain expertise.
 The most famous model is BERT.
 However, the learned model only reflects the inverse of down-scaled mapping, which is used to obtain LR images from their HR fathers.
 In other words, such models can generate new content, which has applications in image or video synthesis for example.
 For instance, Figure 1 demonstrates that the input molecule “N-=N+=NCc1ccc(SCCl)cc1”, expressed here as a SMILES string (Weininger, 1988), can be generated using reactants “CSc1ccc(CN=N+=N-)cc1” and “ClCCl”.
 However, these neural networks still have difficulty learning complex programs from input/output pairs, in the sense of strong generalization.
 For example, a self-driving car must drive safely around unpredictable actors like pedestrians and bicyclists.
 Whether implicitly or explicitly, works that use GANs make a crucial modeling decision known as the manifold assumption (Zhu et al., 2016; Schlegl et al., 2017; Reed et al., 2016).
 This problem is NP-hard, thus being extremely difficult from the viewpoint of theoretical computer science.
 Second, it is often necessary to carefully test a policy before deploying it to the real world; for example, to ensure its behavior is safe and appropriate for humans.
 In contrast, consider a standard neural network classifier with a softmax output layer trained with a cross-entropy loss.
 Recently, (deep) reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated its power at enabling robots with autonomous behaviors (Arulkumaran et al., 2017), such as navigating over an unknown environment (Mirowski et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2017), manipulating objects with robot’s end effectors (Gu et al., 2017; Popov et al., 2017; Rajeswaran et al., 2017), and motion planning (Chen et al., 2017; Everett et al., 2018).
 This representation can be re-purposed on subsequent tasks such as classification and sentiment analysis (Korde & Mahender, 2012).
 Despite edge deployment, training happens predominately in the cloud.
 Automatic image segmentation can have large impact in many domains, e.g, obstacle avoidance in autonomous driving and treatment planning in medical imaging.
 Developers use meaningful identifier names and natural-language documentation to make this happen (Martin, 2008).
An interpretable model, such as a linear sparse regression, lends itself readily to model explanation.
 Testing the ability and limitation of machine learning tools on logical reasoning problems leads to a fundamental understanding of the boundary of learnability and robust AI, and addresses the interesting questions in decision procedures in logic, symbolic reasoning, and program analysis and verification as defined in the programming language community.
 The go-to solution in most cases is Stochastic Gradient Descent with mini-batches (simple batch learning) and its derivatives.
 The representations learnt can then be utilized in a number of downstream tasks such as semi-supervised learning (Kingma et al., 2014; Odena, 2016), synthetic data augmentation and adversarial training (Cisse et al., 2017), text analysis and model based control etc.
 However, in the majority of real-world problems, such as autonomous driving, interactions are extremely costly, thus MFRL becomes infeasible.
 First, it easily suffers from gradient vanishing and exploding problems, which largely limits their ability to learn very long-term dependencies (Pascanu et al., 2013).
 For other unstructured data sources such as point clouds, semantic graphs, and multi-agent trajectories, such an initial ordered structure does not naturally exist.
 Despite losing 50% of all synapses between age two and ten, the brain continues to function (Kolb & Whishaw, 2009; Sowell et al., 2004).
 In order to solve this, many research efforts have been focused on the hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), which decomposes an RL problem into sub-goals.
The No-Free Lunch (NFL) theorem (Wolpert et al., 1997) of search and optimization essentially says there are no general-purpose optimization algorithms that work well on all problems.
 The promise of model-based DRL is to improve sample-efficiency and generalization capacity across tasks.
 More recently proposed models are based on adversarial training such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and its many variants.
 GAIL agents can overcome the exploration challenge by taking advantage of expert demonstrations, while also achieving high asymptotic performance by learning from agent experience.
 Many of these boxes are made by paper or plastic; packing boxes in a more efficient way can greatly reduce material cost or shipping energy.
 For example, teach the machine to recognize the “sliced apple” (unseen pairs) after letting the machine observe the samples of “green apple” and “sliced tomato” (seen pairs), as shown in fig.  1 (upper).
 Apart from substantial performance benefit (Vaswani et al., 2017), attention also provides interpretability to neural models (Wang et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017; Ghaeini et al., 2018) which are usually criticized for being black-box function approximators (Chakraborty et al., 2017).
One of the most widely studied classes of adversarial perturbations is `p-norm constrained adversarial perturbations (Szegedy et al., 2013).
 In particular, ensemble learning was proposed and studied to improve prediction performance by combining several learning models to obtain better results compared to a single one (Dietterich, 2000).
 In hyper-parameter search, the goal is to find the best values of a set of hyper-parameters for a machine learning model (e.g, a neural net).
 However, there are surprisingly few papers conducting visual analyses to explain why the learned similarity of a given image pair is high or low.
 However, the retrosynthesis prediction is challenging since there are massive possible synthetic routes available and it is often difficult to navigate the direction of retrosynthesis process.
 In criminology, we may be interested in predicting when a convicted criminal might reoffend.
 In dialogue systems, these patterns represent associations between word embeddings that can be measured by a Cosine distance to observe male- and female-related analogies that resemble the gender stereotypes of the real world.
 One of the caveats of this task is that annotation is very expensive.
 Despite their impressive predictive accuracy, rigorously quantifying the predictive uncertainty of deep learning models is a challenging and yet an unresolved problem (Gal (2016); Ovadia et al., (2019)).
 An early algorithm example is dynamic programming which memorizes the local information and uses a fixed inference trace to acquire a global optimum.
 • S3: the staff are surly and unhelpful. (easy-negative)
 Several applications, in particular caching in memory constrained systems, have benefited tremendously from BF (Broder et al., 2002).
 Differential privacy (Dwork et al., 2006) has become the de facto standard for protecting an individual’s privacy in machine learning.
 Spectral methods define the graph convolution (GC) as a filtering operator of the graph signal (Defferrard et al., 2016), while spatial methods define the GC as a message passing and aggregation across nodes (Henaff et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2018).
 All these problems can be considered as an image-to-image translation problem, mapping an image from source domain to target domain, for instance, the super-resolution problem of trying to transfer a low-resolution image (source domain) to a corresponding high-resolution image (target domain).
 ML techniques, such as generative models, have also been used for nefarious purposes such as generating “deepfakes” (Liu et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2017).
 Agents must first sufficiently explore the environment to identify high-reward behaviours, before this knowledge can be exploited and refined to maximize long-term rewards.
 However, while these techniques seem to improve on standard metrics like perplexity and even produce remarkably coherent text (Radford et al., 2019), we still do not have appropriate measures to assess long-term properties in language models, making it difficult to choose between different model options for downstream tasks.
 While traditional practice for group-based recognition is to either aggregate the whole set by average (Li et al., 2014; Taigman et al., 2014) or max pooling (Chowdhury et al., 2016), or just sampling randomly (Wang et al., 2016), the fact that certain elements contribute negatively in recognition tasks has been ignored.
In general, the visual interpretation of deep learning models is understood as estimating the impact of a particular neuron activation related to a given input instance.
 For a policy π and a state-action pair (s, a), all these works estimate the advantage function Aπ(s, a) by subtracting an estimate of the value function V π(s) from the estimate of Q-value Qπ(s, a).
 These methods are often used together with the ReLU-like activation functions such as ReLU (Glorot et al., 2011; Nair & Hinton, 2010), ELU (Clevert et al., 2015) and Leaky ReLU (LReLU) (Maas et al., 2013), making the “Norm+ReLU-like” module become one of the most widely-used building blocks of modern CNNs.
 This is illustrated in fig.  1(a).
 For instance, the observed labels ỹns may represent human observations of a ground truth label.
We propose to define behaviors via so-called Behavioral Embedding Maps (BEMs), which are functions mapping trajectories (realizations of policies) into latent behavioral spaces representing trajectories in a compact way.
 For example, cystic fibrosis evolves slowly, allowing for the development of related comorbidities and bacterial infections, and creating distinct behaviors/responses to therapeutic interventions, which in turn makes the survival and quality of life substantially different (Ramos et al., 2017).
 In NLP, large pre-trained language models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) are state-of-the-art on a large number of downstream NLP problems.
 While a lot of research has been dedicated to accelerating inference, we investigate training as (1) accelerating training can speed up research iteration, (2) evolutionary algorithms for DNN architecture exploration are increasingly being used as an alternative to domain expertise (Jaderberg et al., 2017), and network training is moving to edge devices (Pirk et al., 2019).
 By stacking multiple graph convolutional layers, one can learn node representations by utilizing features of its distant neighborhood.
 SGD is simple and has been proved to be efficient, especially for tasks on large datasets.
 In this paper, we study the forward/backward stability and convergence theory of learning ResNet.
 Because tracking is such a generic visual capability, it is of interest in both theoretical and practical computer vision.
 Early NAS approaches (Zoph et al., 2018; Zhong et al., 2018a;b; Liu et al., 2018a; Real et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2018) solves the two problems in a nested manner.
 To address this issue, various global and local explanation methods have been proposed.
 Development of architectures for integrating memory units with neural networks spans a good portion of the history of neural networks themselves (e.g, from LSTMs (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) to the recent Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) (Graves et al., 2014)).
 To regularize the solution of SISR, various priors of natural images have been exploited, especially the current leading learning-based methods (Wang et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2016; Mao et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2016a;b; Tai et al., 2017a;b; Lim et al., 2017; Ahn et al., 2018; Haris et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018) are proposed to directly learn the non-linear LR-HR mapping.
 The ubiquitous of adversarial examples across many tasks (Szegedy et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2017; Eykholt et al., 2018; Carlini & Wagner, 2018) and the fact that they are transferable between different models (Tramèr et al., 2017; Charles et al., 2019; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2017) raise great concerns on security of such models and hinder their actual deployment in real world applications.
 When using specific acquisition function, its regret bound has been proved as O( √ n) (n is the number of sampled points) in Srinivas et al., (2012).
 If interactions can be identified such that the simulation captures macroscopic behaviors observed in experiments, then the simulation can be studied to gain insight into the physical system.
 Since the advent of GANs, substantial efforts have been devoted to addressing these challenges (Salimans et al., 2016; Arjovsky et al., 2017; Gulrajani et al., 2017; Miyato et al., 2018), while non-adversarial approaches that are free of these issues have also gained attention.
A number of efforts have been devoted to compress the DL model size and accelerate its training and test speed.
 During the past few years, a number of methods have been proposed to construct adversarial samples to attack the deep neural networks, including fast gradient sign (FGS) method (Goodfellow et al., 2014b), Jacobian-based saliency map attack (J-BSMA) (Papernot et al., 2016a), and projected gradient descent (PGD) attack (Kurakin et al., 2016; Madry et al., 2018).
 Many variants of GNN have been proposed to solve problems in social networks (Hamilton et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018a), biology (Veličković et al., 2017; 2019), chemistry (Fout et al., 2017; Gilmer et al., 2017), natural language processing (Bastings et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018b; Wu et al., 2019), reasoning for vision (Santoro et al., 2017), and few/zero-shot learning (Garcia and Bruna, 2017; Kampffmeyer et al., 2019).
 Across many of these domains, e.g, natural language processing or speech, the sequence encoder lives at the heart of many powerful state-of-the-art model architectures.
 However, such evaluation does not provide formal guarantees regarding the absence of rare but possibly catastrophic failures (Administration; Board; Ross & Swetlitz, 2018).
 In particular, significant research has emerged from practical applications, which require generation to be based on existing context.
 This motivates research in reducing the redundancy in deep neural networks or designing light-weight structures.
 An elementary example would be equations for projectile motion which do not account for air resistance.
 Existing generative models of waveforms such as WaveNet (van den Oord et al., 2016a) and SampleRNN (Mehri et al., 2016) are well-adapted to model local dependencies, but as these models typically only backpropagate through a fraction of a second, they are unable to capture high-level structure that emerges on the scale of several seconds.
 Particularly in complex environments with sparse reward functions (e.g, maze navigation), the DRL agents need an inordinate amount of interaction with the environment to learn the optimal policy.
 This property is in constant need as the budget for labeling is usually far less than the total number of nodes.
 A model that is trained naively may not have these properties by default; see, for example Barocas & Selbst (2016).
 One way to address this problem is to perform teacher-student compression (TSC, also known as distillation), which consists of training a student model to mimic the outputs of a teacher model (Bucila et al., 2006; Li et al., 2014; Hinton et al., 2015).
 The former optimizes the posterior distribution P (c|x) directly on a training set, whereas the latter finds the class conditional distribution P (x|c) and class prior P (c) and subsequently derives the posterior distribution P (c|x) using Bayes’ rule.
 Such spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial for various tasks, such as dispatching and pricing, in urban computing (Zheng et al., 2014).
 Since the cause generally precedes its effects, known as temporal precedence (Eichler, 2013), recently, an increasing number of studies have focused on causal discovery from time series data.
 While a number of variants have been proposed to incorporate expressive priors for the VAE latent distribution, such as mixtures of Gaussians (Dilokthanakul et al., 2016) and discrete formulations (Rolfe, 2016), the VAE decoder is very limited given that data dimensions are decoded as conditionally independent Gaussian distributions.
 By combining a finite number of primitive components, humans can create an exponential number of new concepts, and use them to rapidly explain current and past experiences (Lake et al., 2017).
 Which points are outliers is often unknown in practice, and thus labeling for which points are outliers versus inliers is scarce or even completely unavailable.
 Further research has also exposed that these models are biased in undesirable ways exacerbating gender and racial biases (Howard et al., 2017; Escudé Font & Costa-Jussà, 2019).
 For deep learning models, Ribeiro et al., (2016) suggest a method for reasoning their decisions by visualizing critical parts of the input for the image classification.
 Take image classification as an example, for almost every commonly used well-performed CNN, attackers are able to construct a small perturbation on an input image.
 In this work, we introduce a technique to improve performance by utilizing prior experiences of the network during training.
 Our work is motivated by the opportunity to maximally leverage these datasets by cleanly extracting such styles in addition to modeling the raw behaviors.
 Simply speaking, a deep neural network can induce new feature embedding of examples and it is trained in such a way that the Euclidean distance between the induced feature embeddings of two similar examples shall be small and that between the induced feature embeddings of two dissimilar pairs shall be large.
 While such frameworks have been shown to be effective on various down-stream tasks such as classification, regression, representation learning, and prediction, it is typically crucial to have access to clean and complete training data.
 Despite deep neural models impressive performance, the computation and computational requirements are substantial for both training and inference phases.
 This arises in a wide range of applications, including autonomous driving, robot control (Finn & Levine, 2017), or other visual perception tasks like action recognition or object tracking (Alahi et al., 2016).
 The resulting network can maintain accuracy based on the specified level of sparsity (Mostafa & Wang, 2019; Zhu & Gupta, 2017; Han et al., 2015a).
 Convolution operates on an implicit lattice representing uniformlysampled signals such as images and audio; thus, we refer to it as lattice convolution throughout this paper.
 Since manual labeling is expensive and time-consuming, it is therefore desirable to leverage or reuse rich labeled data from a related domain.
 Practically, recent advancements in several applications have used insights on loss surfaces to justify their approaches.
 Another example is learning with graphs which contain a huge number of edges and nodes.
 While prior knowledge of the structure of data is not available in the more general setting, a similar approach can be fruitful: unsupervised feature selection should select features that are informative in a general sense, and not just for a specific supervised learning task.
 These methods have achieved huge success in information retrieval (Salton & Buckley, 1988), entity recognition (Lample et al., 2016), sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2013), machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014) and so on.
 Consistent with this, pruning was originally motivated as a means to prevent over-parameterized networks from overfitting to comparatively small datasets (LeCun et al., 1990).
 Variational inference demands the intractable true posterior to be approximated by a tractable distribution.
The application space of INNs is rapidly growing and many approaches for constructing invertible architectures have been proposed.
 Although many robust training algorithms have been developed to overcome adversarial attacking, most heuristically developed methods can be shown to be broken by more powerful adversaries eventually, (e.g, Athalye et al., 2018; Madry et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019).
We revisit the classical method of filtering out suspicious training examples using k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) (Wilson, 1972).
 Efforts to mitigate machine bias has received steadily increasing attention from stakeholders in a wide array of arenas including academia, industry research labs, and advocacy groups.
 Intuitively, an agent could learn more efficiently by focusing its exploration in task-relevant regions, if it has knowledge of the high-level structure of the environment.
 Thus, it is becoming increasingly important that the underlying model provides high quality uncertainty estimates along with its predictions.
 As a result, much research in recent years has focused on how to aggregate the feature representations of neighbor nodes so that the dependence of graphs is effectively utilized.
 This lack of interpretability is a major barrier for their wide adoption, especially in domains (e.g, medicine) where models need to be qualitatively understood and/or verified for robustness.
 Recently, people even introduce network architecture search to automatically learn better network architectures (Zoph & Le, 2017; Liu et al., 2018).
But how is the information in a deep neural network even defined? The weights are not a random variable, and the network outputs a deterministic function of its input, with degenerate (infinite) Shannon Mutual Information between the two.
 When combined with function approximation, Q-learning can become unstable (Baird, 1995; Boyan & Moore, 1995; Tsitsiklis & Roy, 1996; Sutton & Barto, 2018).
 One main issue with these deep learning techniques is that a massive amount of labelled data is typically required to successfully learn these expressive features.
 With a mortality rate of 17% in its benign state and 26% for its severe state (Fleischmann et al., 2016), sepsis is one of the leading causes of hospital mortality (Vincent et al., 2014), costing the healthcare system more than 16 billion dollars in the USA alone (Angus et al., 2001).
 In order to evaluate the robustness of deep neural networks, researchers have developed “attack algorithms” to generate adversarial examples that can mislead a given neural network while being as close as possible to the original example (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016; Carlini & Wagner, 2017b; Chen et al., 2017b).
 Instead, what we are facing with in practice are large data sets which are collected from crowdsourcing platforms or crawled from the Internet, thus containing many noisy labels (Li et al., 2017b; Patrini et al., 2017).
 A deep learning task for labeling a scene image is typically formulated as conditional probability of the form in Eq. 1 Liu et al., (2019),Albert et al., (2017), Nogueira et al., (2016), Castelluccio et al., (2015), Mnih (2013), Mnih & Hinton (2010),P (li|si) (1)where li is label for image patch si.
 Recently, deep RL agents have shown great success across various domains, such as achieving superhuman performance on games (Mnih et al., 2015; Silver et al., 2016; 2018), completing complex robotic tasks (Levine et al., 2016), optimizing patient treatments (Escandell-Montero et al., 2014; Raghu et al., 2017), and developing autonomous driving skills (Pan et al., 2017; Isele et al., 2018).
 Moreover, in many machine learning tasks such as caption generation Xu et al., (2015), the main objective is to obtain new samples rather than to accurately estimate the underlying data distribution.
 Given its spawn location, it can initially proceed straight regardless of the option it chooses until the intersection, at which point it needs to utilise 1 bit of (Shannon) information from the option variable to inform the choice of whether to turn left or right.
 However, recent progress has shown that deep neural network (DNN) classifiers make overconfident predictions even when the input does not belong to any of the known classes (Nguyen et al., (2015)).
 However, human and animal imitation differs markedly from commonly used approaches in machine learning.
 Deep Q-learning, however, still has a very high demand for data samples which is limiting with regard to robot applications.
 These algorithms have focused on settings with task segmentation, where the learning agent knows when tasks change.
 Agents are often trained for millions, or even billions of simulation steps before achieving a reasonable performance (Burda et al., 2018a).
 For example, neural networks are sensitive to small translations and changes in scale (Azulay & Weiss, 2018), blurring and additive noise (Dodge & Karam, 2017), small objects placed in images (Rosenfeld et al., 2018), and even different images from a distribution similar to the training set (Recht et al., 2019; 2018).
 TD3, which introduced clipped double-Q learning, delayed policy updates and target policy smoothing, has been shown to be significantly more sample efficient than popular on-policy methods for a wide range of Mujoco benchmarks.
 The properties of these effective subnetworks and their initialization are however not well understood yet.
Here we compare these models through the perspective of data dimensionality reduction and reconstruction.
 The motivation for using complex-valued representations for deep learning is twofold: On the one hand, biological nervous systems actively make use of synchronization effects to gate signals between neurons – a mechanism that can be recreated in artificial systems by taking into account phase differences (Reichert & Serre, 2014).
 Though accelerators such as GPUs make realtime performance more accessible, compressing networks for faster inference and simpler deployment is an active area of research.
 SCAN (Lee et al., 2018) and MAttNet (Yu et al., 2018) studied learning latent alignment between words and image regions for Image-Text Retrieval (Wang et al., 2016) and Referring Expression Comprehension (Kazemzadeh et al., 2014) tasks.
 Many sparse learning algorithms such as `1-norm convex relaxation methods (Negahban et al., 2009; Van de Geer et al., 2008) have been proposed in the past few decades.
 Qualitative measures can be deceptive.
 Recently, differential equations have also been used as a way to design neural networks (Chen et al., 2018).
In the presence of user generated data, such as activity on mobile phones, Federated Learning (FL) (McMahan & Ramage, 2017) proposes an alternative approach for training a high quality global model without ever sending raw data to the cloud.
For over-parameterized two-layer neural networks, Du et al., (2019); Arora et al., (2019); Chizat & Bach (2018a); Mei et al., (2018) showed the global convergence of the gradient descent.
 To justify the loss, Goodfellow et al., (2014) prove two theoretical results: first, for a given pg, the outer function φ(pg, pdata) is the Jenson-Shannon (JS) distance (minus a constant); second, the outer function is convex in pg, so a gradient descent method on pg converges to the global minimum.
 One simple form of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) is independent learning, where each agent simply treats its experience as part of the non-stationary environment.
 Although a rapidly growing number of researchers use deep learning to solve complex symbolic reasoning and language tasks (a recent review is (Gao et al., 2019)), most existing deep learning models, including sequence models such as LSTMs, do not explicitly capture human-like relational structure information.
It means that the discrepancy between generated text and real text is large.
 The relationship recognition methods are mainly supervised to recognize the entities and then combine various entities in pairs to identify predicates between them.
 The predictive information is the mutual information (MI) between a finite set of observations (the past of a sequence) and an infinite number of additional draws from the same process (the future of a sequence).
A particularly interesting branch of machine learning for molecules is the reverse problem of generating molecular structures, as it opens the door for designing molecules, e.g, obtain new materials (Sanchez-Lengeling & Aspuru-Guzik, 2018; Barnes et al., 2018; Elton et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018a), design or discover pharmacological molecules such as inhibitors or antibodies (Popova et al., 2018; Griffen et al., 2018), optimize biotechnological processes (Guimaraes et al., 2017).
 A representation that is closer to the physical system is one in which a molecule is described by its geometry or conformation.
 Typically, while capturing data coming from different locations with several sensors per location, a sensor may randomly fail or even may be just missing at a given location.
 In contrast, humans can grasp a new concept rapidly and make meaningful generalizations, even from a single example (Schmidt, 2009).
 Meanwhile, many defense schemes have also been proposed to improve the robustnesses of the target models (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Tramèr et al., 2017; Madry et al., 2017; Samangouei et al., 2018).
 However, most combinatorial optimization problems are NP-hard to solve, i.g,, exact solutions are typically intractable to find in practical situations.
 However, challenges remain – systems that outperform humans usually require learning from very large-scale data.
 Unlike traditional spatiotemporal forecasting on grid-structural data, like precipitation nowcasting (Shi et al., 2015) or video frame prediction (Wang et al., 2018), point-cloud stream forecasting needs to operate on geometrically scattered sets of points, which are irregular and unordered, and encapsulate complex spatial correlations.
 As the field of generative modelling has advanced, GANs have remained at the frontier, generating high-fidelity images at large scale (Brock et al., 2018).
 In the absence of any prior knowledge about which states are more useful, an effective exploration scheme is one that visits as many states as possible, allowing a policy to autonomously prepare for user-specified task that it might see at test time.
 This is particularly relevant because the learnt small representation z is task agnostic and, in principle, can be used as input for networks performing different tasks, leading to faster and more robust learning (generalisation property), (Rifai et al., 2011).
 How do we obtain both robust and accurate networks? At the core, adversarial training is a form of data augmentation where we augment the training set with worst-case perturbations of each training image within a ball defined by the attack model.
 As an alternative, Auto-ML approaches aim to automate manual design with meta-learning agents.
 Therefore, it is important to compress them without sacrificing the performance for running the models on resource-constrained devices.
 Importantly, these manifolds are correlated to each other in their structure since the transformation rules according to the size (stretching the foreground patch) or the pose (rotating the patches of body parts) are similar even for different species.
 Typically, supervised few-shot classification is formulated as meta-learning on episodes, where each episode corresponds to two small sets of labeled examples called support and query sets.
 Therefore, structured predictions, one to many mappings of the likely future states of the world, are important.
 Finding the features that drive the output of time series models is a challenging task due to complex non-linear temporal dependencies and cross-correlations in the data.
 A major goal in representation learning is for these embeddings to encode high-level, interpretable features of any given input (Goodfellow et al., 2016; Bengio et al., 2013; Bengio, 2019).
 It has resulted in state-of-the-art performance in the domain of image recognition (Zoph et al., (2018); Real et al., (2019)), object detection (Ghiasi et al., (2019); Chen et al., (2019)) and semantic segmentation (Liu et al., (2019)).
 However, the reliance on human demonstrations largely limits the general applicability of such approaches.
 GCN was shown to be, in particular, effective in semi-supervised learning on attributed graphs.
Here, we investigate a representational property that is well established in the neuroscience literature on the primate visual system: the increasing robustness of neural responses to identity-preserving image transformations.
 Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) in which multiple layers of policies are trained to learn to operate on different levels of temporal abstraction, has long held the promise to learn such difficult tasks (Dayan & Hinton, 1992; Parr & Russell, 1997; Barto & Mahadevan, 2003).
 In this framework, an agent builds an internal representation st by sensing an environment through observational data yt (such as rewards, visual inputs, proprioceptive information) and interacts with the environment by taking actions at according to a policy π(at|st).
 It is well known that humans and large primates can continually learn new skills and accumulate knowledge throughout their lifetime (Fagot & Cook, 2006).
 An efficient exact algorithm was given (Arora et al., 2019) to compute CNTK for CNN architectures, as well as those that include a Global Average Pooling (GAP) layer (defined below).
 As for the objective-constrained task, though only a single objective (denoted the primary objective in the following context) needs to be optimized, its difference from most RL scenarios lies in that there are some additional objectives in the environment.
 To counter this, ML techniques that offer strong privacy guarantees have been developed.
Previous works propose techniques for reducing computations and memory consumption during CNN training.
 The desire for reduced bandwidth and compute requirements of deep learning models has driven research into quantization (Hubara et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2019b; Liu et al., 2019; Gong et al., 2019), pruning (LeCun et al., 1990; Li et al., 2017; Molchanov et al., 2019), and sparsification (Gale et al., 2019; Dettmers & Zettlemoyer, 2019).
 To better solve complicated real-world problems with public or third-party machine learning experts, many companies now needs release some data sets for competitions (e.g, Kaggle) or proof-of-concept purposes.
 However, a well-known disadvantage of reinforcement learning approaches is the demand for a large number of samples for learning; for example, OpenAI Five learned to solve DOTA using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) by playing 180 years worth of games against itself daily (OpenAI, 2018).
 In response to this problem, many studies set their sights on more efficient networks.
 Particularly, one such attack called membership inference reveals whether a particular data sample was present in the training dataset (Shokri et al., 2017).
 Sequential Neural Processes (SNP) (Singh et al., 2019) extend the power of NP to a sequence of stochastic processes thus introducing a new class of sequential latent generative models.
Consistency regularization (Sajjadi et al., 2016b; Laine & Aila, 2017; Miyato et al., 2017; Oliver et al., 2018) describes a class of semi-supervised learning algorithms that have yielded state-ofthe-art results in semi-supervised classification, while being conceptually simple and often easy to implement.
 Then in logistic regression f(w; ξi) = log(1 + e−yiaT i w) + λ2 ‖w‖ 2, and in SVM f(w; ξi) = max(0, 1 − yiaTi w) + λ2 ‖w‖ 2.
Indeed, most theoretical results on neural networks do not model the structure of the training data, while some works build on a setup where inputs are drawn component-wise i.i.d. from some probability distribution, and labels are either random or given by some random, but fixed function of the inputs.
 Some of these scaling rules are contradictory, and Shallue et al., (2018) argue that none of these simple prescriptions work reliably across multiple architectures.
 To cope with this deluge of information, it is vital to design optimal communication systems.
 His study extended also to the teaching of arithmetic: “The student is expected to arrive at 9 · 7 = 63, not by memorizing it as he would memorize a line of poetry, but by putting into practice such principles as that nine times a number is the same as ten times the number minus the number . ”.
 Examples include generating drug molecules, which must satisfy chemical validity requirements, and game levels, where the goal must be reachable from the starting position.
 Instead, it aims to “fool” an adversary, so that the adversary is unable to distinguish between samples from the true distribution and the generated samples.
 One well-known shortcoming of DNNs is that when faced with test data points coming from a different distribution than the data the network was exposed to during training, the DNN will not only output wrong predictions, but it will do so with high confidence.
 Most of existing graph representation learning algorithms focus on problems such as node classification, linking prediction, community detection, etc. (Hamilton et al., 2017a).
 Since then, the machine learning community has rightly focused a great deal of research effort on this phenomenon.
 In biomedicine, scientists collect multitude datasets comprising of many biomarkers (e.g, genes or proteins) that require development of effective diagnostics or prognostics models.
 However, when ∣V ∣ is large (e.g, million of words in language modeling or millions of users in user modeling), this embedding matrix does not scale elegantly and can constitute more than 90% of all trainable parameters in the model.
 In particular, the seminal work by Mnih et al., (2015) introduced the Deep Q-Network (DQN) to approximate the action-value function and achieved a superior performance versus a human expert in playing Atari games, which triggers a line of research on deep reinforcement learning such as Double Deep Q-Learning (Van Hasselt et al., 2016) and Dueling DQN (Wang et al., 2016).
 The Bayesian posterior over parameters is given byp(θ|{xn, yn}Nn=1) ∝ p(θ) N∏n=1p(yn|xn,θ).
 Perhaps the most salient reason for DRL’s surge in popularity is its ability to operate on black-box simulators where the underlying dynamics model is not available.
The challenge is to efficiently learn a mapping from pixels to an appropriate representation for control using only a sparse reward signal.
 The sole existence of such a vulnerability not only raises concerns about the security of deep learning models, but also questions the robustness of the learned representations.
 Furthermore, the federated learning can also significantly reduce data privacy and security risks by enabling to conceal on-device data of each learner from the server or other learners; thus the approach can be applied well to environments with highly private data (e.g, personal medical data), it is now emerging as a promising methodology for privacypreserving distributed learning along with differential privacy-based methods (Hard et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018; Bonawitz et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019).
 It is well understood that in this overparameterized regime, DNNs are highly expressive and have the capacity to (over)fit arbitrary training datasets including pure noise Zhang et al., (2016).
 However, as finding a Nash equilibrium is not as straightforward as finding a local optima, researchers have been forced to develop many ad-hoc tricks and techniques to make GAN training well-behaved.
 Similarly, Netflix offered a prize of one million dollars in an open competition to improve its recommender system (Bell & Koren, 2007).
 Though fully supervised segmentation neural networks have a shown great success, one of their most challenging issues is the need for pixel-level annotations to train them.
 As a result, DeepXML could efficiently train on problems involving millions of labels on a single GPU that were beyond the scaling capabilities of leading deep extreme classifiers.
 Such systems are usually built on the seq2seq (Sutskever et al., 2014) framework, in which an input sequence (the current state of the document) is first encoded into a vector representation and a decoder then constructs a new sequence from this information.
 It breaks the independence between training examples within a batch, performs poorly with small batch sizes (Wu & He, 2018), and increases the cost of computing an update (Wu et al., 2018).
 As the system behavior changes over time due to external events and/or internal modifications, the problem of identifying the locations of these changes, referred to as Change Point Detection (CPD) has quickly drawn researchers attention.
 Self-supervised and unsupervised representation learning approaches have been proposed to address this problem (Bengio et al., 2007).
 A large body of research exists for detecting entire images as OOD for the task of image classification.
 Practically, since statistical modelling of the data is often difficult, it degenerates to domain description (Tax & Duin, 1999) or supervised prediction (Gornitz et al., 2013) problems in some cases.
 A RL agent cannot improve its behaviour without receiving rewards exceeding the expectation of the agent, and this happens only as the consequence of properly exploring the environment.
 We assume that st has a sparse representation ht ∈ Rh in a dictionary D ∈ Rn0×h, that is, st = Dht.
 Unstructured factors, such as what makes a cat look like a cat, are too complicated to model analytically, requiring free-form representation learning.
 This is the opposite of what would normally work well when learning a deep model from scratch, i.g,, training on a lot of data with some loss function that may need labels or not.
To alleviate this problem, researchers have made efforts, mainly focusing in two directions.
 The last few years have witnessed tremendous expansion of metro network (Sun et al., 2018).
 In the literature, this is achieved using Voice Conversion (VC) technique (Stylianou (2009)).
 The gradient descent algorithm is a standard optimization algorithm that converges linearly (i.e exponentially fast) if f is regular enough.
 Moreover, they are amenable to one-shot and few-shot learning since the set of classes that can be represented does not depend directly on the dimensionality of the embedding space.
 As long as human beings create or develop new objects, their number might continue to increase daily, thereby creating difficulty in obtaining labeled data of all classes to predict.
 To overcome these complexities, compression methods have been utilized, aiming to exploit the inherent resilience of DNNs to noise.
 However, little attention has been paid toward scaling the storage layer, where training starts and training data is sourced.
 Since problem (1) is ill-posed, it is common to assume thatM belongs to some low dimensional subspace.
 However, in a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), pixel level perturbation can cause kernels to generate incorrect feature maps.
 Similar network structures have been applied to multiple instance learning (Pevný and Somol, 2016).
 Student B studies by learning the underlying reasons for why things are the way they are.
The most common architecture used in practice for multi-task learning is the so-called shared bottom, where the tasks share parameters in the early layers of the model, which are followed by task-specific heads.
 Two prominent examples of such models are sparse coding (Olshausen & Field, 1997) and independent component analysis (ICA) (Bell & Sejnowski, 1997).
 As image processing and computer graphics have advanced, there has been a considerable effort to simulate these styles using non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) techniques (Kumar et al., (2019)).
 Due to the rarity of anomalies, the data underlying AD problems exhibits high class-imbalance.
 Learning this mapping is often made challenging due to a high-D (dimension) low-N (number of samples) setting (Nasrabadi, 2007).
 These embeddings, learnt on massive datasets, are commonly used to perform downstream tasks such as classification or data generation.
 Often this is done by fitting a generative probability model.
However, a system’s safety can also depend on its behavior on visible transformations.
 The most common algorithms underlying deep learning are stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants, which led to a significant amount of research on building and understanding distributed versions of SGD.
 Recently, significant theoretical progress has been made on several fronts that have shown promise in making neural network design more systematic.
Most neural network-based approaches to representation learning, focus on learning locations of entities in a low dimensional Euclidean vector space.
 RNNs and LSTMs struggle to solve even simple memorization tasks (Arjovsky et al., 2015; Graves et al., 2014).
 These shortcomings pose an obstacle in wide-scale adoption of DNNs and expose an inherent weakness in their reliability.
 Among them, a broad array of work is convolutional, extending convolution filters in the spatial domain to the spectral domain or to local neighborhoods (Bruna et al., 2014; Henaff et al., 2015; Duvenaud et al., 2015; Defferrard et al., 2016; Kipf & Welling, 2017; Hamilton et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Velic̆ković et al., 2018; Ying et al., 2018a; Liao et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019b); whereas a few others are recurrent, which treat the representation of a graph node as the state of a dynamical system, being recurrently updated (Scarselli et al., 2009; Li et al., 2016; Gilmer et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2017).
 However, retrieving problems may occur if irrelevant segments impose negative impacts on reading comprehension.
 There remain different approaches to understanding and quantifying neural network expressivity.
 The goal of such systems is to produce images of high perceptual quality to a humanobserver.
 For example, in remote sensing applications, satellite imagery are frequently occluded by meteorological perturbations such as clouds and rains (Singh & Komodakis, 2018).
 A fundamental limitation of ensembles is the cost of computation and memory at evaluation time.
 The most common method of training these models is the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) which maximize the log predictive likelihood of each true token in the training sequence given the previous observed tokens.
 In contrast, the latter usually needs significantly less training samples, but often fails to achieve state-of-the-art results on complex tasks (which is primarily attributed to models’ imperfections).
 Such adversarial examples containing small magnitude of perturbation have shed light on understanding and discovering potential vulnerabilities of DNNs (Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014b; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016; Papernot et al., 2016; Carlini & Wagner, 2017; Xiao et al., 2018b;c;a; 2019).
 Variational inference (VI) is a well-known method using optimisation, which fits a parametric approximation to the target distribution.
 Similarly, an image of a cat and the word ‘cat’ are expressing two views of the same underlying concept.
As GNNs have superior performance in graph-related tasks, the question as to what makes GNNs so powerful is naturally raised.
 To construct an attribution map, many methods approximate the attribution value of an input region by the classification probability change when that region is absent i.g,removed from the image.
 Typically, a regression model is trained on a large number of data points to be able to provide accurate predictions for new inputs.
 In Machine Learning a neuron is the infinitesimal nucleus of intelligence (i.g, {atom, matter} ↔ {neuron, AI}), whose structural arrangement in layers produces complex intelligence models.
 While doing so would result in a better prediction, such a strategy is cheating - by changing the task rather than solving the task as intended.
 The difficulty in modeling such data is that, most machine learning techniques rely on co-occurrence of features to model their interactions, while in sparse data such co-occurrences are relatively rare compared to the number of possible feature combinations, and hence over-fitting occurs.
 In environments with sparse reward signals, it becomes extremely challenging for an agent to explore and learn a useful policy.
 The video moment retrieval task, also known as text-to-clip retrieval, combines language and video understanding to find activities described by a natural language sentence.
 What accounts for this monumental difference in data-efficiency between biological and machine vision? While highly-structured representations (e.g, as proposed by Lake et al., 2015) may improve data-efficiency, it remains unclear how to program explicit structures that capture the enormous complexity of real visual scenes like those in ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015).
 Quantum Mechanical (QM) simulations can be used for the calculation of potential energies based upon the interaction of atoms.
In this work, we tackle the issue of protecting policies by training policies that aim to prevent an external observer from using behaviour cloning.
 Recent link prediction models (e.g, Bordes et al., 2013; Trouillon et al., 2016; Balažević et al., 2019b) learn entity representations, or embeddings, of far lower dimensionality than the number of entities, by capturing latent structure in the data.
 However, it is never an easy task to curate such datasets.
 Typically, a standard and well-studied formulation for reinforcement learning with constraints are the constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) framework (Altman, 1999), where the discounted sum of safety cost should be under certain bounds.
 This enhanced performance has enabled the adoption of larger neural networks.
 ES approaches are highly parallelizable and account for robust learning, while having decent data-efficiency.
 Consequently, it has been widely supposed in the field that it is impossible to recover the parameters of a network merely by observing its output on different inputs.
 Imitation learning (Schaal, 1999), is an appealing methodology that aims at overcoming this challenge – instead of complex programming, the user only provides a set of demonstrations of the intended behavior.
 As a fundamental, sparse recovery or sparse representation (SR) has been substantially investigated in the last two decades due to the emergence of Compressive Sensing (CS) (Zhang & Rao, 2011; Yu et al., 2012; Needell & Tropp, 2009; Yu et al., 2015; Daubechies et al., 2004).
Despite GNNs’ powerful ability of learning expressive node embeddings, unfortunately, GNNs can only be used when graph-structured data is available.
 More importantly, it is common that the training dataset for adaptation is noisy and small, or the labels in the target domain do not match with the source or even unknown.
 Indeed, it was recently shown that an adversary can inject noise unrecognizable to a human and force the network to misclassify (Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2017; Carlini & Wagner, 2018; Carlini et al., 2016; Qin et al., 2019; Neekhara et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Esmaeilpour et al., 2019), exposing a serious security flaw.
 Much of the focus so far has been on restricted, norm-based perturbations and while these cover important attacker models, it has been shown that natural perturbations, e.g, image rotation, can trigger adversarial behaviors not covered by norm-based attacks (Engstrom et al., 2017).
Bayesian neural network (BNN), a neural network (NN) that uses probability distributions as weights, estimates not only predictive results but also uncertainties.
 In particular, in a multilayer network of d − 1 hidden layers with n neurons each, there are (n!)d−1 equivalent configurations corresponding to the permutation of neuron indices in each layer of the network (Goodfellow et al., 2016; Bishop, 1995).
 However, larger capacity will also cause heavier computational costs and storage, making these powerful models difficult to meet real-time requirements on embedded systems.
 This apparent vulnerability is worrisome as deep nets start to proliferate in the real-world, including in safety-critical deployments.
 These advances owe in part to the success of Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) (Arjovsky et al., 2017; Gulrajani et al., 2017), leveraging the neural net induced integral probability metric to better measure the difference between a target and a generated distribution.
 To this end, several works (Das et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2015; Gupta et al., 2019) have introduced external knowledge in traditional topic models via word embeddings Pennington et al., (2014).
 Those techniques are standard practices in supervised learning tasks from many domains.
 Panoptic segmentation unifies both tasks that investigate to segment both things (such as person, cars) and stuff (such as road, sky) classes.
 Theoretically, the catastrophic forgetting problem can be completely avoided if we store all of the past data, but it is sometimes difficult to store all of the previous data due to the limitation on memory capacity.
 In such cases, DRL has difficulty in carrying out the tasks.
 While programs can be taught to immediately answer such puzzles, it points to a fundamental lack of understanding that limits their ability to perform complex programming and mathematics.
 This happens possibly due to mismatches of the mathematical model, incorrect numerical discretization, poor discrete resolution, or errors on the estimation of parameters.
 The standard sigmoid and the hyperbolic tangent were the most common activation functions, before the introductio of ReLU.
 BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful (Devlin et al., 2019).
In particular, for learning from visual observations of the physical world, such representation should consider the following criteria.
 In order to enable training in a reasonable time, distributed training is an important technique and gains increasing attention (Li et al., 2014; Dean et al., 2012; Recht et al., 2011; Goyal et al., 2017; Jia et al., 2018).
 While these models perform very well in the typical offline decoding use case, few studies consider how S2S models are affected by low-latency constraints, and which architectures and strategies are the most efficient.
 (1)Here, G is the probability distribution generated by the generator, D is the classifier provided by the discriminator, and Pdata is the target measure, for example the empirical distribution of the training data.
 In particular, understanding what do hidden layers do and how to achieve remarkable performance remain persistently elusive.
 Physics simulators, both traditional numerical solvers and learned prediction models, still suffer from insufficient accuracy in challenging scenarios.
 Learning on attributed graphs including node classification and clustering finds many important applications in real-world networks.
 In the line of this research, researchers have explored various notions of model interpretability.
 These generative models can create sample images that are nearly indistinguishable from real ones.
 Variational Autoencoders, PixelCNN and flow-based models cannot distinguish common objects like cats and dogs from house numbers.
 This phenomenon is called catastrophic forgetting and is a long-standing challenge for machine learning and neural networks and, consequently, for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems (Hassabis et al., (2017); Thrun & Mitchell (1995)).
 Evolution does have what amounts to an effective oracle access to the (indeed, complex and intractable) mapping from genotype to phenotype.
 Intuitively, this is at odds with the traditional notion of generalization ability such as model complexity.
 Instead of using full batch gradients, the variants of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Robbins & Monro, 1951; Zhang, 2004; Bottou, 2010; Sutskever et al., 2013; Duchi et al., 2011; Kingma & Ba, 2014) evaluate noisy gradient estimates from small mini-batches of randomly sampled training points at each iteration.
 A second advantage is their easier adaptability to new media formats, such as light-field cameras, 360◦ images, Virtual Reality (VR), video streaming, etc.
 In fact, it has been shown that deep networks can even perfectly fit pure noise (Zhang et al., 2016).
 If the agent explores novel states excessively, it might never find rewards to guide the learning direction.
 However, by looking at its porous texture or observing its interaction with water, you can understand that this object can absorb liquid.
 As a case study, heteroscedastic noise is the rule rather than the exception in the majority of scientific datasets.
Many such DL approaches for non-Euclidian objects are based on the idea of performing a convolution operation in the spectral domain with a suitably chosen nonlinear trainable filter.
 There is a rich literature aiming to alleviate this issue, including using techniques from unsupervised machine learning and crowdsourcing.
 Although these model-free schemes can achieve state-of-the-art performance, they often require millions of interactions with the environment.
 There are several challenges for generating adversarial text: 1) most existing gradient-based adversarial attack approaches are not directly applicable to the discrete structured data; 2) it is less clear how to appropriately measure the naturalness of the generated text compared to the original ones; 3) the manipulation space of text is limited, and it is unclear whether generating a new appended sentence or manipulating individual words will affect human judgements.
 Today, regression based neural networks (NNs) are being deployed in safety critical domains of computer vision (Godard et al., 2017) as well as in robotics and control (Bojarski et al., 2016) where the ability to infer model uncertainty is crucial for eventual wide-scale adoption.
 In contrast, deep exploration (Osband et al., 2016) overcomes this dilemma via temporally extended behaviors with a long-term vision.
To be formal, let X = {x1, . ,xn} denote the set of observable data points and Z = {z1, . ,zn} the set of desired latent vectors, where xi ∈ Rdx and zi ∈ Rdz . Let pg(x|z) denote the likelihood of generated sample conditioned on latent variable z and p(z) the prior, where g denotes the decoder .
Despite the success of multi-task learning, when applying to ‘discrete’ data (graph/text), most of the current multi-task learning frameworks (Zamir et al., 2018; Ish, 2016) only leverage the general task dependency with the assumption that the task dependency remains the same for (1) different data samples; and (2) different sub-structures (node/word) in one data sample (graph/text).
 As manual labeling of data in each test domain is prohibitively expensive, unsupervised domain adaptation (uDA) has emerged as a promising solution to transfer the knowledge from a labeled source domain to unlabeled target domains (Long et al., (2015; 2017); Ganin et al., (2016); Tzeng et al., (2017); Hoffman et al., (2018); Shen et al., (2018); Sankaranarayanan et al., (2018); Hoffman et al., (2018)).
 A model’s inability to handle adversarially chosen input text puts into perspective otherwise impressive generalisation results for in-distribution test sets (Seo et al., (2017); Yu et al., (2018); Devlin et al., (2019); inter alia) and constitutes an important caveat to conclusions drawn regarding a model’s language understanding abilities.
 The difficulty comes from two factors: 1) The most sophisticated classification methods that make use of neural nets require vast amounts of labeled data and labeling domain-specific text snippets requires costly expertise.
 To add further nuance, the same protein can play different roles depending on the tissue it is in and the state of that tissue.
We focus on one such task: natural language inference (NLI), where the aim is to detect, whether the meaning of one sentence can be inferred from another one, contradicts it, or neither.
 One of the most active topics of research in BO is how to extend current methods to higher-dimensional spaces.
 Second order methods, such as natural gradient descent (Amari, 1998), compensate for the effect of curvature by using the distance metric intrinsic to the space of input-output maps to define the update steps (Pascanu & Bengio, 2013; Martens, 2014; Bernacchia et al., 2018), rather than the parameter space.
 Automatic ICD coding (Stanfill et al., 2010) is in great demand as manual coding can be labor-intensive and error-prone.
A rich literature exists on interpolation for irregularly-sampled signals and images (also referred to as inpainting in image processing (4)).
 While meta-learning approaches that utilize neural network representations have made progress in few-shot image classification, reinforcement learning, and, more recently, image semantic segmentation, the training algorithms and model architectures have become increasingly specialized to the low data regime.
 The goal of this paper is to investigate and develop optimization techniques to accelerate training large deep neural networks, mostly focusing on approaches based on variants of SGD.
 While Rolnick et al., (2017) empirically demonstrated that DNNs can be surprisingly robust to label noise under certain conditions, Zhang et al., (2017) has shown that DNNs have the capacity to memorize the data and will do so eventually when being confronted with too many noisy labels.
 Recent attempts have been focused on exploiting Neural Network (NN) based approaches that do not require manually-designed rules and are end-to-end trainable.
 Furthermore, the learned representation can be used to perform Transfer Learning (TL), i.g,using it as a preliminary knowledge to learn a new similar task resulting in a more effective and faster learning than learning the new task from scratch (Baxter, 2000; Thrun & Pratt, 2012).
 Another popular use of RL is for training GANs (Yang et al., 2018; Tevet et al., 2018).
 Since pooling operations are shown to be effective in many image and NLP tasks, it is natural to investigate pooling techniques for graph data (Yu & Koltun, 2016; Springenberg et al., 2014).
 In particular, Koopmans-Beckmann’s QAP (Loiola et al., 2007) with objective tr(X>F1XF2) is a special case of Eq. (1), which can be converted to Lawler’s QAP by K = F2⊗F1 and Fi refers to the weighted adjacency matrix.
 Given a graph in which some nodes are labeled, the aim of semi-supervised classification is to infer the categories of those remaining unlabeled nodes by using various priors of the graph.
Standard approaches based on behavioral cloning (BC) use supervised learning to greedily imitate demonstrated actions, without reasoning about the consequences of actions (Pomerleau, 1991).
 Namely, the state-of-the-art performance in problems with tabular heterogeneous data is often achieved by “shallow” models, such as gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT) (Friedman, 2001; Chen & Guestrin, 2016; Ke et al., 2017; Prokhorenkova et al., 2018).
 However, even with such large-scale datasets, for person images from a new camera system, the person re-ID models trained on existing datasets generally show evident performance drops because of the domain gaps.
 We argue this is not always possible in real applications.
 This target represents the highest value the agent thinks it could obtain from the current state and action, given the observed reward.
 The main idea behind federated learning is to have each node learn on its own local data and not share either the data or the model parameters.
 However, current models apply the same amount of computation regardless of whether the input is easy or hard.
Most of the previous works utilize some form of sparsity-inducing regularizer in searching for sparse neural networks.
 While this may seem intuitive, the search phase of these algorithms often differ in several ways, such as their architecture sampling strategy and the search space they use, and the impact of these individual factors cannot be identified by looking at the downstream task results only.
 For example, an autonomous vehicle should understand that a neighboring car can merge into its lane even though the car is most likely to keep driving straight.
When r(x) = 0 and X = Rn, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been used to solve the optimization problem (1).
 In contrast, lifelong learning is designed to address a stream of tasks by accumulating interconnected knowledge between learned tasks and retaining the performance of those tasks.
 It is unfair and not efficient to compel the taxi driver to selflessly contribute to the company, e.g, to stay in the low customer demand area.
Spectral approaches (Bruna et al., 2013; Defferrard et al., 2016; Henaff et al., 2015; Veličković et al., 2017) apply convolution to eigen-decomposed graph Laplacians and are generally efficient in both computation and memory.
 In almost all of the aforementioned scenarios, detrimental consequences could be avoided by refraining from making decisions or consulting human experts, in the cases of decisions with insufficient confidence.
 Therefore, DPP has been utilized in a large body of diversity-oriented tasks.
 And yet, unlike areas such as computer vision or natural language processing where deep learning (DL) techniques are now well entrenched, there still exists evidence that ML and DL struggle to outperform classical statistical TS forecasting approaches (Makridakis et al., 2018a;b).
 However, globally shared meta-learners fail to handle tasks lying in different distributions, which is known as task heterogeneity (Vuorio et al., 2018; Yao et al., 2019b).
 Extensive efforts have been devoted to developing approximate methods.
 As a result, it is essential to have more efficient network architectures and less expensive inference overhead.
 Any other learning tasks reside in between these two tasks, so are their performances.
 One problem that arises here is that as the model learns on the new tasks, it could forget what it learned for the earlier tasks, which is known as the problem of catastrophic forgetting.
 In addition, CL frameworks should continually adapt to any domain shift occurring across tasks.
In recent years, especially after the seminal work of Pointer Networks (Vinyals et al., 2015), researchers start to develop new deep learning and reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks to solve combinatorial optimization problems (Bello et al., 2016; Mao et al., 2016; Khalil et al., 2017; Bengio et al., 2018; Kool et al., 2019; Chen & Tian, 2019).
The current state-of-the-art focuses on using BERT models for pre-training (Devlin et al., 2019), which employ large text corpora on general subjects: Wikipedia and the Toronto Books Corpus (Zhu et al., 2015).
Instead of using one QBN for the whole CNN, the layer-wise network quantization (Wang et al., 2019; Elthakeb et al., 2018) assigns a QBN to the weights of each convolutional layer, and searches another QBN for the activations of the same layer to decrease the inference computing overhead.
 The searched NAS architectures (Zoph et al., 2018; Real et al., 2019; Pham et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2019b; Luo et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2019; Akimoto et al., 2019; Nayman et al., 2019) have outperformed best expert-designed architectures on many computer vision and natural language processing tasks.
Although numerous efforts (Hausknecht & Stone, 2015; Foerster et al., 2016; Igl et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2018) have been paid to tackle this problem, there still exist various challenges.
 However, since a value function is associated with a certain policy, the samples collected by former policies cannot be readily used without complicated manipulations (Degris et al., 2012) and extensive parameter tuning (Nachum et al., 2017).
 Even though the task seems ill-posed as there is no natural objective one should optimize, by leveraging domain knowledge this approach can be successfully applied to a variety of problem areas, including image (Kolesnikov et al., 2019; van den Oord et al., 2018; Hénaff et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2019; Hjelm et al., 2019; Bachman et al., 2019) and video classification (Wang and Gupta, 2015; Sun et al., 2019), and natural language understanding (van den Oord et al., 2018; Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019).
 In this framework, there is a spectrum of analysis, ranging from almost purely theoretical analysis (Wang et al., 2019; Asadi et al., 2018) to full empirical results on diverse environments (Zhang et al., 2018c; Packer et al., 2018).
 Such images are called adversarial examples and there have been active research efforts in designing attacks that show the susceptibility of CNNs.
In this paper, we focus on the neural network quantization for efficient inference.
Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) (Zinkevich et al., 2008) provides a state-of-the-art approach for solving TEGIs with much progress in practice (Brown & Sandholm, 2017b; Moravčík et al., 2017; Brown & Sandholm, 2019a).
Thus, in this paper, we propose a method to diagnose representations of intermediate layers of a DNN from the perspective of knowledge consistency. i.g,given two DNNs pre-trained for the same task, no matter whether the DNNs have the same or different architectures, we aim to examine whether intermediate layers of the two DNNs encode similar visual concepts.
 Many objects also exhibit strong view-dependent appearance effects, such as specularities.
Contrary to the worst-case reasoning above, researchers have observed that simple first-order algorithm such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) 1, performs surprisingly well in practice, even1In conjunction with Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) and Batch Normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015)without any explicit regularization terms in the objective function (Zhang et al., 2017).
 The verification problem has been extensively studied under different natural language tasks such as recognizing textual entailment (RTE) (Dagan et al., 2005), natural language inference (NLI) (Bowman et al., 2015), claim verification (Popat et al., 2017; Hanselowski et al., 2018; Thorne et al., 2018) and multimodal language reasoning (NLVR/NLVR2) (Suhr et al., 2017; 2019).
 We provide a formal description of MAML in Section 2.
 MANNs have demonstrated significant improvements over memory-less RNNs in various sequential learning tasks (Graves et al., 2016; Le et al., 2018a; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015).
 First, the robot must handle large amounts of uncertainty as the horizon increases.
 However, RL is not scalable in many real-world control problems.
Encoder: This turns the set of points into a latent space.
 These representations have proven to be surprisingly effective, playing key roles in recent improvements in various models for diverse NLP tasks.
 For example, in knowledge base completion tasks, each edge is represented by a triple 〈head, rel, tail〉 that contains two entities and their relation.
 Previous work shows that adversarial examples mainly root from the locally unstable behavior of classifiers on the data manifolds (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Fawzi et al., 2016; 2018; Pang et al., 2018b), where a small adversarial perturbation in the input space can lead to an unreasonable shift in the feature space.
Unsupervised disentangling methods are highly desirable as they assume no prior knowledge about the ground truth factors.
 For example, we can learn the meaning of a new word and then apply it to other language contexts.
 To improve adversarial robustness of classifiers, various kinds of defenses have been proposed, but many of them are quickly shown to be ineffective to the adaptive attacks, which are adapted to the specific details of the proposed defenses (Athalye et al., 2018).
 One such property is the optimization algorithm - while neural networks can express a multitude of possible ERM solutions for a given training set, gradient-based methods with the right initialization may be implicitly biased towards certain solutions which generalize.
 This type of input compression can improve generalization (Tishby et al., 2000), and has recently been extended to deep parametric models, such as neural networks where it has been shown to improve generalization (Achille & Soatto, 2016; Alemi et al., 2016).
 This profound intuition reflects some fundamental properties of the world in which we dwell, and in this work we ask whether and how these properties can be exploited to learn a representation that functionally mimics our understanding of the asymmetric nature of time.
Though the emergence of adversarial examples has received significant attention and led to various defend approaches for developing robust models (Madry et al., 2018; Dhillon et al., 2018; Wang & Yu, 2019; Song et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019a), many proposed defense methods provide few benefits for the true robustness but mask the gradients on which most attacks rely (Carlini & Wagner, 2017a; Athalye et al., 2018; Uesato et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019).
 After Lecun & Bengio (1995) introduced them in the 90s, CNNs had their break-through in the competition ILSVRC2012 with the architecture of Krizhevsky et al., (2012).
For notation: a dataset D = { xi, ti, yi }Ni=1 used for treatment effect estimation has the following format: for the ith instance (e.g, patient), we have some context information xi ∈ X ⊆ RK (e.g, age, BMI, blood work, etc.), the administered treatment ti chosen from a set of treatment options T (e.g, {0: medication, 1: surgery}), and the respective observed outcome yi ∈ Y (e.g, survival time; Y ⊆ R+) as a result of receiving treatment ti.
 The Laplacian (Chung, 1996), the matrix extracted from the graph induced by the agent’s policy and the dynamics of the environment, is often used when discovering options for exploration (e.g, Machado and Bowling, 2016; Machado et al., 2017; 2018; Jinnai et al., 2019b).
 Despite GANs’ advantages, they have critical drawbacks.
 This structure supports a kind of messagepassing, where a value vector vj ∈ V derived from entity j is propagated to update an entity i with weight qi · kj , where qi ∈ H is a query vector derived from entity i, kj ∈ H is a key vector derived from entity j, and the inner product on H is written as a dot product.
 However, in many practical few-shot imitation settings, there is an identifiability problem: it may not be possible to precisely determine a policy from one or a few demonstrations, especially in a new situation.
While these results from prior work are alarming, object detection is in fact only the first half of the visual perception pipeline in autonomous driving, or in robotic systems in general — in the second half, the detected objects must also be tracked, in a process called Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), to build the moving trajectories, called trackers, of surrounding obstacles.
 These alternative methods inevitably yield samples with noisy labels.
 This vulnerability of DNNs raises serious security concerns about their practicability in security critical applications (Chen et al., 2015; Kurakin et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2019; Finlayson et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2019).
 In practice, moreover, policy gradient methods typically employ carefully tuned entropy regularization in order to prevent policy collapse.
 For example, if a user has a virtual assistant at home, it should not worry about its private data being collected and processed by an untrusted cloud operator.
 Moreover, the optimal choice of step size η∗ for SGD in that setting can be derived analytically.
 The idea then is to pre-train networks via pretext tasks that do not require expensive manual annotations and can be automatically generated from the data itself.
 The goal of disentanglement learning is to find a representation of the data r(x) which captures all the ground-truth factors of variation in z independently.
 It is now known that overparameterised networks enjoy both easier training (Allen-Zhu et al., 2019; Du et al., 2019; Frankle & Carbin, 2019), and better generalisation (Belkin et al., 2019; Neyshabur et al., 2019; Novak et al., 2018).
 Several approaches have been proposed for OOD detection on top of or within a neural network classifier (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2017; Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017; Liang et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018).
Prior work on language grounding and language-based RL (see Luketina et al., (2019) for a recent survey) are limited to scenarios in which language specifies the goal for some fixed environment dynamics (Branavan et al., 2011; Hermann et al., 2017; Bahdanau et al., 2019; Fried et al., 2018; Co-Reyes et al., 2019), or the dynamics of the environment vary and are presented in language for some fixed goal (Branavan et al., 2012).
 Maron et al., (2019b) derived a universal approximation theorem over invariant functions targeted towards deep networks whose layers are linear and equivariant to permutation of their input.
 In this paper, we especially focus on incremental domain adaptation (IDA)3, where we assume different domains come sequentially one after another.
 In the most problematic tasks, agents may fail to begin learning at all.
 Concretely, we focus on two aspects of identifiability.
 And modelling errors in dynamics that accumulate with time-steps greatly limit the applications of MBRL algorithms.
 This phenomenon applies to both learning the policy and the value function.
 Since the dynamics of TD do not follow the gradient of any objective function, the interaction of the geometry of the function class with that of the TD algorithm in the space of all functions potentially eliminates any convergence guarantees.
 Even in the most extreme low-resource scenario–a single training example per class–this approach yields 99.6% accuracy on the character recognition task (Sung et al., 2018).
 The advantage of SGD with stochastic momentum has been widely observed (Hoffer et al., (2017); Loshchilov & Hutter (2019); Wilson et al., (2017)).
 We explore whether it’s possible to attack a victim policy by building an adversarial policy that takes actions in a shared environment, inducing natural observations which have adversarial effects on the victim.
 An appealing alternative to supervised learning is to utilize large unlabeled datasets, combined with predictive generative models.
 However, researchers have recently reported inconsistent perspectives on the appropriate designs for GCN architectures.
 For instance, the new state-of-the-art for WNLI (Wang et al., 2019a), ReCoRD (Zhang et al., 2018) and SWAG (Zellers et al., 2018) is achieved by pretrained models.
 A single misclassified image can be negligible in academic research but can be fatal for a pedestrian in front of a self-driving vehicle.
Deep learning has emerged as a powerful framework for solving difficult prediction problems across many domains, including vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), speech (Hinton et al., 2012), and text (Sutskever et al., 2014).
 Such has motivated the enthusiasm on designing low-latency, more efficient segmentation networks, without sacrificing accuracy notably (Zhao et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018a).
 In novelty detection, Yu et al., (2017) proposed a method to generate unseen data and used them to train an anomaly detector.
 However, when the data is imbalanced, this formulation is not reasonable since the data coming from minor class have little effect in this case and the model is almost determined by the data from the majority class.
Researchers have proposed a variety of defense methods to improve the robustness of neural networks.
 Many new defenses have been proposed (Song et al., 2017; Gong et al., 2017; Grosse et al., 2017; Metzen et al., 2017), only to be broken shortly thereafter (Carlini & Wagner, 2017a; Athalye et al., 2018).
Due to the mentioned vulnerabilities, there has been a recent surge toward designing defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks (Gu & Rigazio, 2014; Jin et al., 2015; Papernot et al., 2016b; Bastani et al., 2016; Madry et al., 2017; Sinha et al., 2018), which has in turn motivated the design of stronger attacks that defeat the proposed defenses (Goodfellow et al., 2014b; Kurakin et al., 2016b;a; Carlini & Wagner, 2017b; Xiao et al., 2018; Athalye et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018; He et al., 2018).
 These tasks are often encountered in real life, such as videos games that require memorization of previous events (Kapturowski et al., 2018; Jaderberg et al., 2019) and robotic control using real-time images as input (Hafner et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019).
 Parallelism in learning has been investigated widely in distributed RL (Nair et al., (2015); Mnih et al., (2016); Horgan et al., (2018); Barth-Maron et al., (2018); Espeholt et al., (2018)), evolutionary algorithms (Salimans et al., (2017); Choromanski et al., (2018); Khadka & Tumer (2018); Pourchot & Sigaud (2019)), concurrent RL (Silver et al., (2013); Guo & Brunskill (2015); Dimakopoulou & Van Roy (2018); Dimakopoulou et al., (2018)) and population-based training (PBT) (Jaderberg et al., (2017; 2018); Conti et al., (2018)).
 While related to NLU, it focuses on the pragmatics (Clark, 1996) of learning natural language, as it implies learning language from scratch, grounded in experience.
 The transfer-based attack methods first pretrain a source model and then generate adversarial examples using a standard white-box attack method on the source model to attack an unknown target network (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Madry et al., 2018; Carlini & Wagner, 2017; Papernot et al., 2016a).
 First, pre-select a number of images from the space of all possible natural images (i.g,, natural image manifold) to form the test set.
 Although BERTLARGE outperforms BERTBASE generally, it was observed that finetuning sometimes fails when a target dataset has fewer than 10,000 training instances (Devlin et al., 2018; Phang et al., 2018).
 The agent takes an action a, obtain a reward r, and then the environment transits to another state.
 However, over complex datasets such as ImageNet, the classification accuracy of a learned deep convolutional network is much higher than a scattering transform or any other predefined representation (Oyallon et al., 2019).
 The downside of the overparametrization is its high memory and computational costs, which prevent the use of these networks in small devices, e.g, smartphones.
 Recently, deep generative models (Kingma et al., 2014; Dinh et al., 2017; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Kingma et al., 2018; Schlegl et al., 2017) are widely used for novelty detection due to their ability to model high dimensional data.
 Understanding the loss surface would be helpful in several relevant research areas, such as the ability to estimate data distributions, the optimization of neural networks, and the generalization to unseen data.
State-space models (SSMs) are a wide class of sequential latent variable models (LVMs) that serve as workhorses for the analysis of dynamical systems and sequence data.
 The parameter server maintains the globally shared model parameters and aggregate updates from workers.
 One major class of works incorporates various multiagent coordination mechanisms into deep multiagent learning architecture (Lowe et al., 2017; Foerster et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018; Palmer et al., 2018).
 A video containing a short explanation of our method, samples of output videos, and a comparison to previous work, is provided in
 Therefore, there is an increasing demand for robust training methods.
 A good representation for human faces, for example, should encompass different latent factors that separately encode different attributes including gender, hair color, facial expression, etc.
 However, these empirical defenses were often soon broken by adaptive adversaries (Carlini & Wagner, 2017a; Athalye et al., 2018).
 Consequently, model-free approaches have shown the best final performance on large complex tasks (Mnih et al., 2015; 2016; Hessel et al., 2018), especially those requiring hard exploration (Bellemare et al., 2016; Ostrovski et al., 2017).
Meanwhile, for tasks at the intersection of vision and language, such as image captioning (Young et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2018), visual question answering (VQA) (Antol et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017; Goyal et al., 2017; Hudson & Manning, 2019), visual commonsense reasoning (VCR) (Zellers et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2019), there lacks such pre-trained generic feature representations.
Interestingly, modern convolutional networks follow an analogous process by making abstractions through local connectivity and weight sharing (Zhang, 2019).
Ensembles of NNs are known to yield increased accuracy over a single model (Murphy, 2012), allow useful measures of uncertainty to be derived (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017), and also provide defense against adversarial attacks (Smith & Gal, 2018).
Synchronous SGD (SSGD) is the most common method used to distribute the learning process across multiple workers.
 However, the resulting models are not necessarily mechanistic (or causal) in the sense that interpretable properties of an image cannot be ascribed to a particular part, a module, of the network architecture.
Our approach, called physics-as-inverse-graphics, solves the physical modeling problem via a novel vision-as-inverse-graphics encoder-decoder system that can render and de-render image components using Spatial Transformers (ST) (Jaderberg et al., 2015) in a way that makes it possible for the latent representation to generate disentangled interpretable states (position/velocity).
 This also makes the triangle inequality a potentially useful inductive bias for learning distances.
 One such common approach is model scaling, where one designs and compares small-scale models, and applies the obtained architectural principles at a larger scale (e.g, Liu et al., 2018; Real et al., 2018; Zoph et al., 2018).
To motivate the goal of incorporating a symbolic KB into a neural network, consider the task of learning neural semantic parsers from denotations.
Verifying programs with loops requires determining loop invariants, which captures the effect of the loop on the program state irrespective of the actual number of loop iterations.
 Still, it remains unclear which approach and search algorithm is preferable.
 Lately there has been a surge of interest in the task of video prediction, i.g,, to predict future frames of a video sequence (Wang et al., (2017; 2018); Denton et al., (2017); Denton & Fergus (2018); Villegas et al., (2017); Lee et al., (2018)).
 Also, it is easy to tell a higher pitch between two notes, but absolute pitch is a rare ability (Bachem, 1955).
In natural language understanding, logical reasoning is an important ability to examine, analyze and critically evaluate arguments as they occur in ordinary language according to the definition from Law School Admission Council (2019a).
 Previously, researchers approached this challenge by designing a two-stream model for appearance and motion information respectively, combining them by late or intermediate fusion to obtain successful results: Simonyan & Zisserman (2014); Feichtenhofer et al., (2016b;a; 2017; 2018).
The effectiveness of learned representations has given new impetus to research in representation learning, leading to a lot of work being done on the development of techniques for inducing representations from data having desirable properties like disentanglement and compactness (Burgess et al., 2018; Achille & Soatto, 2017; Bengio, 2013; Locatello et al., 2019).
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014) cast learning representations for high-dimensional distributions as a variational inference problem.
 Directly taking the backbone of classification network for object detectors is sub-optimal, which has been observed in Li et al., (2018).
 Several such methods have been proposed and work well in this domain, for example for image classification (Simonyan et al., 2013; Zeiler & Fergus, 2014; Fong & Vedaldi, 2017), sequential models (Karpathy et al., 2016) or through attention (Xu et al., 2015).
 As a result, it can be difficult to uniformly assess the effectiveness of one method against another.
 (For some deeper theoretical exploration of implicit bias in deep learning and related settings, see (Gunasekar et al., 2017; 2018a;b; Ma et al., 2018).) Even more recently, authors have proved generalization bounds in terms of the distance from the initial setting of the weights instead of the size of the weights (Dziugaite and Roy, 2017; Bartlett et al., 2017; Neyshabur et al., 2019; Nagarajan and Kolter, 2019).
The most classic algorithm for OCO is Online Gradient Descent (OGD) (Zinkevich, 2003), which attains an O( √ T ) regret.
The majority of current CL research is conducted in the context of online multi-task learning (Nguyen et al., 2018; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Schwarz et al., 2018; Rusu et al., 2016; Fernando et al., 2017), where the main objective is to prevent catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks.
 We start this work by considering multiplicative interactions as an object of study in their own right.
 Given the scarcity and difficulty involved with generation of labeled graph samples, it becomes all the more important to solve the problem of graph classification in the few-shot setting.
 These RL methods, however, heavily rely on human expert domain knowledge to design proper reward functions.
A typical approach for transfer learning is to transfer a part of the network that has already been trained on a similar task, add one or more layers at the end, and then re-train the model.
We consider grounding open domain dialogue generation with knowledge which is assumed to be unstructured documents.
 In addition, the falling price and the increasing availability of the equipment required for VR/AR has fueled the demand for stereoscopic contents.
 Despite that, state-of-the-art neural models like the Transformer still prefer the linear (sequential) form of natural language (Vaswani et al., 2017; Ott et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018).
 The Nash equilibrium plays a critical role in understanding the social dynamics of self-interested agents (Ash, 2000; Axtell, 2002) and constructing the optimal policy of a particular agent via fictitious selfplay (Bowling and Veloso, 2000; Ganzfried and Sandholm, 2009).
 Verifying whether the network satisfies these properties sheds light on the properties of the function that it represents.
 Upon successful training the two sets of samples become indistinguishable with respect to the critic.
 Just as computer vision methods benefit from the inductive bias inherent to convolutional neural networks (LeCun et al., 1989), and likewise with LSTMs for natural language and other sequence data (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997), it stands to reason that ML techniques for computer programs will benefit from architectures with a suitable inductive bias.
 The prediction scores of all clips are simply averaged to yield the video-level prediction.
An early approach to skill discovery in continuous-state environments was skill chaining (Konidaris & Barto, 2009b), where an agent constructs a sequence of options that target a salient event in the MDP (for example, the goal state).
Reasoning about photo integrity and origin relies on subtle statistical traces, e.g, fingerprints of imaging sensors (Chen et al., 2008), color interpolation artifacts (Popescu & Farid, 2005), or pixel co-occurrence patterns (Marra et al., 2019b; Mayer & Stamm, 2019).
 In particular, Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2010) and its variants, e.g, RMSprop (Hinton et al., 2012), Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014), Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012) and Nadam (Dozat, 2016), stand out due to their fast convergence, and have been considered as the optimizer of choice in many applications.
 It is also common to employ heuristic shaping, such as the Cartesian distance to a goal for an object relocation task (Mahmood et al., 2018; Haarnoja et al., 2018a).
 These methods fall under the framework of meta-learning, in which a meta-learner extracts knowledge from many related tasks (in the meta-training phase) and leverages that knowledge to quickly learn new tasks (in the meta-testing phase).
 A common intuitive way to think about disentangled representations is that it should reflect the compositional.
 Although efforts have been made to understand the feature relationships, there is still no method that can interpret the feature interactions learned by a generic recommender system, nor is there a strong commercial incentive to do so.
 Despite their empirical effectiveness in downstream tasks such as representation learning (Hjelm et al., 2018; Velicković et al., 2018), their effectiveness for MI estimation remains unclear.
 Such methods have been leveraged to increase sample efficiency in RL (Gregor et al., 2019) and other supervised tasks (van Steenkiste et al., 2019).
 Therefore, numerous GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) for text generation were proposed since they do not suffer from exposure bias due a training objective that directly seeks to improve sample quality (to a learned critic).
One technique to improve image generation diversity is to feed the image generator with an additional latent code in the hope that such code can carry information that is not covered by the input condition, so that diverse output images are achieved by decoding the missing information conveyed through different latent codes.
 The advantages of using such algorithms to create networks for low precision hardware has been demonstrated in several deployed systems (Esser et al., 2016; Jouppi et al., 2017; Qiu et al., 2016).
Science fiction has long dreamed of virtual realities filled of synthetic content as rich as, or richer, than the real world (e.g, The Matrix, Ready Player One).
Current semantic segmentation datasets have pixel-wise annotations for each image.
 Since the gradient points to the direction of steepest ascent, an input can be perturbed along the gradient’s direction to maximize the network’s loss, thereby potentially causing misclassification under class prediction, e.g, with images, or evasion under detection, e.g, with malware.
 Shallow unsupervised AD methods such as the One-Class SVM (Schölkopf et al., 2001; Tax & Duin, 2004), Kernel Density Estimation (Parzen, 1962; Kim & Scott, 2012; Vandermeulen & Scott, 2013), or Isolation Forest (Liu et al., 2008) often require manual feature engineering to be effective on high-dimensional data and are limited in their scalability to large datasets.
However, as training datasets continue to grow in size, we argue that an additional limiting factor is that of resource constraints for training.
 Representations generated using DNNs typically have a higher dimension compared to hand-crafted features such as SIFT (Lowe, 2004), and moreover are dense.
 Theoretically, TD with linear function approximation has been shown to converge to the fixed point solution with i.i.d samples and Markovian samples in Sutton (1988); Tsitsiklis and Van Roy (1997).
 This realization is at the heart of imitation learning (Ho & Ermon, 2016; Ng et al.,; Pomerleau, 1989), in which one aims to learn a behavior policy from a set of expert demonstrations – logged experience data of a near-optimal policy interacting with the environment – without explicit knowledge of rewards.
 A proposed meta-learning algorithm then looks at learning properties that generalize across the different training tasks, and result in fast and efficient learning of the evaluation tasks.
 Reliable computational tools can accelerate and guide experimental efforts to find new materials faster.
For linear classifiers, the relationship between output margin and generalization is simple and direct – generalization error is controlled by the output margins normalized by the classifier norm.
 Moreover, the models repeat themselves at the token, phrase, and sentence levels, and statistics comparing a set of human-generated utterances and model-generated responses indicate a discrepancy between the human and model word distributions.
Combining state-of-the-art neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems with probabilistic latent variable models provides a natural framework for discovering aspects of speech that are rarely labelled or even difficult to describe.
 In this paper, we develop a method for detecting this last form of extrapolation.
 An adversarial data or model is defined to be one that is close to a bonafide data or model in some space, but exhibits unwanted or malicious behavior.
In this work, we focus on a popular and flexible meta-learning approach, parameter transfer via gradient-based meta-learning (GBML).
 Recent progress in this direction has been made by considering a meta-problem: though we are not interested in learning about any training class in particular, we can exploit the training classes for the purpose of learning to learn new classes from few examples, thus acquiring a learning procedure that can be directly applied to new few-shot learning problems too.
 Many real-world applications besides query-document retrieval can be cast into this form.
 While work has augmented IL with goal conditioning (Dosovitskiy & Koltun, 2016; Codevilla et al., 2018), it requires goals to be specified during training, explicit goal labels, and are simple (e.g, turning).
 Even settings with a global objective that seem unfactorizable can be formulated as multi-goal problems: in Starcraft II micromanagement, a unit that gathers resources must not accidentally jeopardize a teammate’s attempt to scout the opponent base (Blizzard Entertainment, 2019); in traffic flow optimization, different intersection controllers may have local throughput goals but must cooperate for high global performance (Zhang et al., 2019).
 In the past decade, convolutional neural networks (LeCun et al., 2015) have achieved state-of-the-art results in image denoising (Zhang et al., 2017; Chen & Pock, 2017).
 Most of them consider the white-box setting, where the attacker has full knowledge about the victim model, and thus gradient based optimization can be used for attack.
 TVM and TensorComprehensions are based on random or genetic algorithms to search the space of optimized code for neural networks.
 When the two orientations are similar, the central grating appears tilted slightly away from the surround (fig.  1a, top).
 A number of tasks have also been designed specifically to understand models in terms of their ability to generalize to test situations that are poorly represented during training (e.g, Few-Show learning, Li et al., 2006), or even consist of a diverse and entirely novel set of sub-tasks (Zamir et al., 2018).
 Such a non-autoregressive factorization assumes that the output tokens are independent from each other.
Although FL is capable of aggregating dispersed (and often restricted) information provided by different parties to train a better model, its distributed learning methodology as well as inherently heterogeneous (i.g,, non-i.i.d.) data distribution across different parties may unintentionally provide a venue to new attacks.
There are three main challenges in using BNNs: (1) Intractable posterior: Computing and storing the exact posterior distribution over the network weights is intractable due to the complexity and high-dimensionality of deep networks.
 Even in situations where training without normalization layers is possible, their usage can still aid generalization (Zhang et al., 2019).
 Recent works (Andrychowicz et al., 2016; Wichrowska et al., 2017; Lv et al., 2017) have shown promising results that these learned optimizers can often outperform widely used hand-designed algorithms such as SGD, RMSProp, ADAM, etc.
Several works have proposed systems for distributed RL (Heess et al., 2017; Liang et al., 2018a; Tian et al., 2019; Silver et al., 2016; OpenAI, 2018; Espeholt et al., 2018).
 As a consequence, the confidence estimates of deep neural networks are flawed even for test data from the training distribution since, by construction, they overestimate the likelihood of the training data.
 The limited computational, memory, and energy budgets on these devices impose major challenges for the deployment of large DNN models at the edge.
 Consider the question in Figure 1; a model needs to understand the compositional reasoning structure of the questions, perform accurate information extraction from the passage (eg. extract lengths, kickers, etc. for the field goals and touchdowns), and perform symbolic reasoning (eg. counting, sorting, etc.).
 Nonetheless, neural networks with tens of millions of parameters have proven effective tools for learning expressive representations of geometric data.
 These bidirectional methods, however, often make restrictive parametric assumptions that limit their image generation ability.
 More importantly, NAS has been proved to be effective and obtained the remarkable performance in image classification (Pham et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018b), object detection (Ghiasi et al., 2019) and semantic segmentation (Chen et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019).
 To progress in these games, an agent must generate natural language actions that are coherent, contextually relevant, and able to effect the desired change in the world.
 Second, once a dynamics model is learned, it can be shared across multiple tasks within the same environment.
Machine learning approaches have been applied to many of these classic tasks, from tasks with known polynomial time algorithms such as shortest paths (Graves et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2019) and sorting (Reed & De Freitas, 2015), to intractable tasks such as travelling salesman (Vinyals et al., 2015; Bello et al., 2016; Kool et al., 2018), boolean satisfiability (Selsam et al., 2018; Selsam & Bjørner, 2019), and even probabilistic inference (Yoon et al., 2018).
In the recently emerging architecture such as Residual Network (He et al., 2016) and Densely Connected Network (Huang et al., 2017), most parameters concentrate on convolution filters, which are used to learn deformation invariant features in the input volume.
However, most of the existing research on GCNs (Kipf & Welling, 2016; Hamilton et al., 2017; Veličković et al., 2018) have focused on learning representations of nodes in simple undirected graphs.
 However, structure and causal learning are daunting tasks due to both the combinatorial nature of the space of structures (the number of DAGs grows super exponentially with the number of nodes) and the question of structure identifiability (see Section 2.2).
 Zhang et al., (2017) also observe that neural networks can perfectly fit corrupted labels while maintaining a certain amount of generalization power1.
We start by observing that this phenomenon is not limited to neural networks trained with GD but also applies to Random Forests and Decision Trees.
 Few weeks later, you are at a coffee shop near your house and you see the same little girl, this time with a man.
 A dialogue state consists of a set of (slot, value) pairs e.g, (attraction-area, centre) and (train-day, tuesday).
 This seemingly simple update rule has had significant success in learning complex patterns for sequential input data.
 However, a number of distinct observations indicate that significant and consequential changes are occurring during the most early stage of training.
 The batch statistics with small batch size are highly unstable, leading to slow convergence during training and bad performance during inference.
 For instance, multiple spatially separated labs may be working on the same clinical trial.
 Second, ANNs are susceptible to adversarial attacks, or the deliberate creation of inputs designed to fool ANNs that may be imperceptibly different from correctly classified inputs (Szegedy et al., (2013)).
 In addition to enabling study of systems with these properties in a relatively simple setting, analysis of deep linear networks also facilitates the scientific understanding of deep learning because using linear networks can control for the effect of architecture choices on the expressiveness of networks (Arora et al., 2018; Du & Hu, 2019).
 However, in practice, imposing this structure leads to improved performance when compared to fully connected models, and as a result, Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have enjoyed wide use for computer vision tasks (Krizhevsky et al., 2012).
 In the context of sequence generation problems, semi-supervised approaches have been shown to work well in some cases.
 The underlying connections could further contribute to the prediction of these subprocesses over the unobserved areas.
 As a result, legacy programs in these languages do not reap all the benefits of gradual typing.
Inspired by the aforementioned scientific evidence, we would like to ask three related questions from the perspective of machine learning: 1) Is it possible to match the identity of faces and voices? (inference) 2) If so, is it possible to generate a face image from a speech signal? (generation) 3) Can we find the relationship between the two modalities only using cross-modal self-supervision with the data “in-the-wild”? To answer these questions, we design a two-step approach where the inference and generation stages are trained sequentially.
 Learning this task does not require supervision from any annotations; supervision is freely available to a mobile agent in a 3D world who can estimate its egomotion (Patla, 1991).
 Motivated by this, a number of works have recently emerged that try to study long-tailed recognition, i.g,, recognition in a setting where the number of instances in each class highly varies and follows a long-tailed distribution.
The current crop of RL agents are typically trained in a single environment (usually a simulator).
 Catastrophic forgetting (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989; McClelland et al., 1995) refers to the significant drop in the performance of a learner when switching from a trained task to a new one.
Deep neural networks (DNNs) have great expressive power (model complexity) to learn challenging tasks.
 Institutions responsible for these applications of ML must balance data stewardship obligations—including minimizing the risks of data loss, theft, or abuse—with the practical needs of the “modeler” whose job is to develop and improve the machine learned models.
 In neural networks, SGD (Bottou, 2003) and its variants such as Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) are the most common optimization algorithm.
 These two objections have lead researchers to search for more biologically motivated alternatives to BP.
 This motivates the study of overparameterized networks trained by gradient descent, using properties of the NTK.
While many methods have been proposed to model physics-simulated observations using deep learning, many of them are designed under the assumption that input is on a continuous domain.
The first implementation of bits back coding (Frey, 1997; Frey & Hinton, 1996) made use of first-infirst-out (FIFO) arithmetic coding (AC) (Witten et al., 1987).
 Yet, IMPALA suffers from reduced sample efficiency since it cannot safely take multiple SGD steps per batch as PPO can.
 It is common to train contextual sequence generation models using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which attempts to maximize the likelihood of each token in a target sequence given its preceding tokens.
Since the introduction of GANs, there have been many techniques proposed to stabilize GANs training, including studies of new generator/discriminator architectures, loss functions, and regularization techniques.
 On the other hand, lifelong learning can enable substantial parameter sharing and deliver multiple target tasks with less training time and smaller model size, but may suffer from catastrophic forgetting or lower accuracy (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989).
 Instead, proper correction must be made to remove the bias in data distribution.
 It has been observed that deeply stacking the layers often results in significant drops in performance for GNNs, such as GCN and GAT, even beyond just a few (2–4) layers.
 Therefore preventing over-fitting is crucial for robust performance since mislabeled data are ubiquitous in very large datasets (Krishna et al., 2016).
First attempts in this direction showed that one can modify an attribute of a generated image by adding a learned vector on its latent code (Radford et al., 2015) or by combining the latent code of two images (Karras et al., 2018).
 The success in predicting an outcome for previously unseen data then depends on how well the inductive bias captures the ground reality.
 (1) As the data matrix Y can represent a variety of signals (e.g, images, audios, languages, and genetics etc) in practical applications, SDL provides a versatile structure-seeking formulation that has found widespread applications in computational neuroscience, image processing, computer vision, and machine learning at large (Olshausen & Field, 1996; 1997; Argyriou et al., 2008; Ranzato et al., 2007; Elad & Aharon, 2006; Wright et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2013; Mairal et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014; 2019).
 Such information can be used to encourage energy saving by optimizing appliance usage (Armel et al., 2013), to track the wellbeing of elderly living alone (Donini et al., 2013; Debes et al., 2016), or to provide users with behavioral analytics (Zhou & Yang, 2016; Zipperer et al., 2013).
There has been a recent surge of research on connecting neural networks trained via gradient descent with the neural tangent kernel (NTK) (Jacot et al., 2018; Du et al., 2018a;b; Chizat & Bach, 2018b; Allen-Zhu et al., 2018a; Arora et al., 2019a;b).
Nash equilibrium is a typical solution concept for a two-player perfect-recall IIG.
One model relevant to these questions is multilingual BERT, a version of BERT pre-trained on 104 languages that achieves remarkable transfer on downstream tasks.
 However, the temporal and interactive nature of RL systems presents a unique set of opportunities and challenges.
 Because of this small number of examples and the big search space of possible programs, there are often millions of programs consistent with I.
 Discrete-time models, including RNNs (Jain & Medsker, 1999), often struggle to fully meet the needs of such applications due to the fixed time resolution.
 While each decision tree may achieve mediocre performance, the aggregated random forest performs significantly better and less correlated if the decision trees are heterogeneous.
 Specifically, fine-tuning on pre-trained ImageNet classification models (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015; He et al., 2016b) has achieved impressive results for tasks such as object detection (Ren et al., 2015) and segmentation (He et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017) and is becoming the de-facto standard of solving computer vision problems.
 However, once such models are trained, controlling attributes of generated text becomes difficult without modifying the model architecture to allow for extra input attributes or fine-tuning with attribute-specific data (Keskar et al., 2019; Ziegler et al., 2019).
 Learning the representation of these two components independently facilitates in understanding the real 3D world.
 That is, reduced sets of input words can suffice to trigger more confident predictions.
 This vulnerability not only poses a security risk in using neural networks in critical applications like autonomous driving (Bojarski et al., 2016) but also presents an interesting research problem about how these models work.
 For MAML (Finn et al., 2017) and MetaOpt SVM (Lee et al., 2019), we use the number of episodes in the author’s Github implementation.
 This has led to the need for methods that offer provable guarantees that the predictor cannot be forced to misclassify an example by any attack algorithm restricted to produce perturbations within a certain set (for example, within an `p norm ball).
 However, often we instead wish to transfer knowledge about a representation.
Over recent years, applying deep learning methods to address symbolic superoptimization has attracted great attention.
 Experiments show that the generalization of a neural network can be efficiently improved through manually designing data augmentation policies.
 These approaches include controlling the model complexity (Neyshabur et al., 2017), reducing information from inputs (Tishby et al., 1999), obtaining smoother loss surface (Shirish Keskar et al., 2017; Neyshabur et al., 2017; Chaudhari et al., 2017; Santurkar et al., 2018), smoothing softmax probabilities (Pereyra et al., 2017) or training for multiple tasks with multi-task (Caruana, 1997) and meta-learning (Thrun & Pratt, 1998).
 In another example, Datta et al., (2015) demonstrate gender discrimination in online advertisements for web pages associated with employment.
 However, there are often complex nonlinear batch artifacts generated by the different labs.
 For example, there is a wealth of work demonstrating that it is possible to replace expensive convolutional blocks in a large network with cheap alternatives e.g, those using grouped convolutions (Chollet, 2017; Xie et al., 2017; Ioannou et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2018) or bottleneck structures (He et al., 2016; Sandler et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2018).
 These approaches include cleansing noisy labels before training begins (Hodge & Austin, 2004), making the training process robust to noise (Patrini et al., 2017; Vahdat, 2017; Rolnick et al., 2017) and actively modeling label noise (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Joseph et al., 1995).
 Learning such representations that align with the underlying factors of variation may be critical to the development of machine learning models that are explainable or human-controllable (Gilpin et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019; Klys et al., 2018).
Several gradient-based attacks have been proposed to generate adversarial examples, such as onestep attacks (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and iterative attacks (Kurakin et al., 2016; Dong et al., 2018).
 The most direct and principled approach for studying generalization in deep learning is to prove a generalization bound; typically an upper bound on the test error based on some quantity that can be calculated on the training set.
 Therefore, neural network verification has become an important tool for analyzing and understanding the behavior of neural networks, with applications in safety-critical applications (Katz et al., 2017; Julian et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2019), model explanation (Shih et al., 2018) and robustness analysis (Tjeng et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018c; Gehr et al., 2018; Wong & Kolter, 2018; Singh et al., 2018; Weng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018).
 For example, if X̃ = (x2,x1,x3, . ,xn) then F (X̃) = (F (X)2,F (X)1,F (X)3, . ,F (X)n).
 However, this algorithm faces generalization difficulties in the regime of very large batch sizes as we will review now.
 Similar issues appear in e.g, transferring the style of one artist to another (Gatys et al., 2015) or adding snow to sunny California streets (Liu et al., 2017).
 Therefore, the classical notion of local Nash equilibrium from simultaneous games may not be a proper definition of local optima for sequential games since mini-max is in general not equal to maximin.
 Continual learning (CL) aims at imitating incredible human’s ability to learn from a non-iid stream of data without catastrophically forgetting the previously learned knowledge.
 Instead, conflicting interpretations have manifested over the last few years, that further confound practitioners and researchers alike.
 Probability calibration is important whenever you need the predictions to make probabilistic sense, i.g,, if the model predicts a fact is true with 80% confidence, it should to be correct 80% of the times.
 Some what surprisingly, however, many previous studies have reported that this intuitive approach has an adverse effect on model performances (Hazan et al., 2015; Luo et al., 2018; Śmieja et al., 2018), and none of them has investigated the reasons of such performance degradations.
 Inspired from the success of deep CNNs on image classification, several attempts have been proposed to explore how to build deep GCNs towards node classification (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Li et al., 2018a; Xu et al., 2018a; Li et al., 2019); nevertheless, none of them delivers sufficiently expressive architecture.
 In unsupervised settings where no paired data is available, multiple works (Anoosheh et al., (2018); Choi et al., (2018); Huang et al., (2018); Kim et al., (2017); Liu et al., (2017); Royer et al., (2017); Taigman et al., (2017); Yi et al., (2017); Zhu et al., (2017)) successfully have translated images using shared latent space (Liu et al., (2017)) and cycle consistency assumptions (Kim et al., (2017); Zhu et al., (2017)).
 The necessity of specific features for classification performance depends on other features.
Our work is based on the information bottleneck principle (Tishby et al., 2000) where a representation becomes less affected by nuisances by discarding all information from the input that is not useful for a given task, resulting in increased robustness.
Subsampling is traditionally approached by exploiting expert knowledge on the signal of interest.
 In both cases, the machine learning model is not supposed to learn from the outliers in the training dataset.
Here we consider the model parallelism setting where a computation graph can be executed using multiple devices in parallel.
 This is useful for maximizing the coverage to give the best chance of finding the target in unknown environments or for efficiently pre-mapping environments on a limited time-budget.
 An attacker can take advantage of this behavior to intentionally modify the inputs in a manner that forces the DNN model tomis-classify, and the overall system that uses the DNN to fail.
 Classical CNNs are a special case of G-CNNs that are equivariant to translations and, in contrast to unconstrained NNs, they make advantage of (and preserve) the basic structure of signal data throughout the network (LeCun et al., 1990).
Deep learning methods have revolutionized many computer vision applications including 2D/3D object detection (Lang et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2019), semantic segmentation (Li et al., 2018; Kirillov et al., 2019), human pose estimation (Sun et al., 2019), etc.
 In contrast, standard pruning or distillation methods follow a strategy that often includes a finetuning or retraining step, and the process must be repeated for each desired depth.
 Not only is the model contextual, but its training also requires no supervision – no alignment between the languages is done.
 It may also enable visual variable binding (Sun, 1992) for reasoning and causal inference over the relationships between the objects and agents in a scene.
 In case that X is equipped with a distance metric function dX : X ×X → R+, we can quantify the embedding distortion by measuring the ratio dX / dG between pairs of corresponding embedded points and nodes.
 The logic rules incorporate prior knowledge and allow MLNs to generalize in tasks with small amount of labeled data, while the graphical model formalism provides a principled framework for dealing with uncertainty in data.
 At each time step, a finite horizon forecast is made from a predictive model of the system and the optimal actions are computed, generally relying on convex constrained Quadratic Programming (QP, Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004; Bemporad et al., 2000).
 iterations (Scaman et al., 2017; 2018; Lian et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2018; Koloskova et al., 2019; Assran et al., 2019).
A commonly-used threat model allows the adversary to manipulate the agent’s observations at every time step, where the goal of the adversary is to decrease the agent’s total accumulated reward.
 This is made possible thanks to the attention mechanism—originally introduced in Neural Machine Translation to better handle long-range dependencies (Bahdanau et al., 2015).
 For many reinforcement learning applications, the value of the decision is defined in a long- or infinite-horizon, which makes OPPE more challenging.
We take inspiration from the curious behavior observed in young humans and other animals and hypothesize that curiosity is a mechanism found by evolution that encourages meaningful exploration early in an agent\\u2019s life.
 Many other works have shown that demonstrations can accelerate learning and address hard-exploration tasks (e.g, see Hester et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2013; Nair et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2018).
 In meta-testing1, one is given the support set and the inputs of the query set xt := {xt,i}ni=1, and asked to predict the labels yt := {yt,i}ni=1.
Unlike discriminative models, which can ignore class-irrelevant information, conditional generative models cannot discard any information in the input, potentially making it harder to fool them.
 A key task for artificial intelligence is to empower computers to learn to separate between different attributes of observed data, often referred to as disentanglement.
 They are usually thought to live on a “natural image manifold” (Zhu et al., 2016), a continuous lower-dimensional subset of the space in which they are represented.
The current gold standard for biomolecular design is directed evolution, which was recently recognized with a Nobel prize (Arnold, 1998) and is a form of randomized local search.
 In this paper we focus on highly practical adversarial attacks that fulfill the following two criteria.
 Recent work in multi-task RL has attempted to address this; however, they focused on the setting where the structure of task are explicitly described with natural language instructions (Oh et al., 2017; Andreas et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2017; Chaplot et al., 2018), programs (Denil et al., 2017), or graph structures (Sohn et al., 2018).
 Recently, deep autoencoders and their variants have shown outstanding performances in finding compact representations from complex data, and the reconstruction error has been chosen as a popular metric for detecting novelty (An & Cho, 2015; Vasilev et al., 2018).
 Lagrangian structures, which track the motion in a moving local frame such as a particle system (Monaghan, 1992), and Eulerian structures, which describe the evolution in a fixed world frame such as a Cartersian grid (Fedkiw et al., 2001), are the two mainstream approaches.
 These models have been shown effective for many downstream NLU tasks.
 Despite these appealing properties, binary neural networks have been criticized as binarization typically results in large accuracy drops.
 (1) we see that when β → 0 it will encourage I(X;Z) = 0 which leads to a trivial representation Z that is independent of X , while when β → +∞, it reduces to a maximum likelihood objective1 that does not constrain the information flow.
 Designing of search spaces is critical for NAS algorithms and different choices have been explored.
 In addition, in contrast to state-of-the-art algorithms in deep learning (e.g, Bottou (2010), Duchi et al., (2011), Kingma & Ba (2015)), these methods often achieve global convergence guarantees by only exploiting local structures of the problem.
 These appealing properties make it act as a fundamental measure of true dependence.
 For example, a single transformer deep model executes more than 10G Mult-Adds in order to translate a sentence of only 30 words.
 Training and generalization ability then rests on fitting the training data while controlling, either explicitly or implicitly, the magnitude of the weights.
 Replacing the discriminator, WGAN trains a critic to approximate the Wasserstein distance between the real and generated distributions.
 Several approaches have been proposed to bridge the gap between machine and human continual learning skills with catastrophic forgetting being the central problem.
 Behavior cloning (Ross et al., 2011b) formulates a supervised learning problem to learn a policy that maps states to actions using demonstration trajectories.
 To this era of deep learning, grouping cues can be learned from massive annotated datasets.
To date, a variety of different approaches has been proposed to generate adversarial examples (Goodfellow et al., 2014b; Carlini & Wagner, 2017; Kurakin et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2018a); and many of these attacks search for perturbation within a bounded Lp norm in order to preserve their photorealism.
 Because GAN training implicitly requires finding the Nash equilibrium of a non-convex game in a continuous and high dimensional parameter space, it is substantially more complicated than standard neural network training.
As eq. (1.2) is merely affine in the parameters, it is not outlandish that gradient descent can be analyzed.
 In addition to symbols, another essential dimension is time.
 In this work we address model stealing, which involves an adversary attempting to counterfeit the functionality of a target victim ML model by exploiting black-box access (query inputs in, posterior predictions out).
 The dominant trend is to map images to features that are immune to the domain shift, so that the classifier works equally well on the source and target domains (Fernando et al., 2013; Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015; Sun & Saenko, 2016).
 A principled approach to uncertainty quantification allows for better execution of planning and situation-awareness tasks such as grasping, tracking, and motion estimation.
 Such observations suggest that the human visual system is equivariant to a large transformation group containing translation, rotation, scaling, among others.
However, gradient based training of quantized DNNs is difficult, as the gradient of a quantization function vanishes almost everywhere, i.g,, backpropagation through a quantized DNN almost always returns a zero gradient.
 Progress in accelerating the training procedure and thereby scaling up extreme classification promises to dramatically improve, e.g, advertising (Prabhu et al., 2018), recommender systems, ranking algorithms (Bhatia et al., 2015; Jain et al., 2016), and medical diagnostics (Bengio et al., 2019; Lippert et al., 2017; Baumel et al., 2018)While scalable softmax approximations have been proposed, each one has its drawbacks.
 This is a result of several factors, such as unavailable original implementations, differences in the employed search spaces, training or evaluation pipelines, hyperparameter settings, and even pseudorandom number seeds (Lindauer & Hutter, 2019).
 In particular, if the cost of failure is large, for example where the automated system has the capability to accidentally hurt humans, the availability and quality of uncertainty estimates can determine whether the system is safe to deploy at all (Carvalho, 2016; Leibig et al., 2017; Michelmore et al., 2018).
RNNs are very powerful, and empirical studies have shown that they have a very good generalization property.
 Oftentimes, we wish to compare data lying in entirely different spaces, for example to track model evolution or compare models having different representation space.
 For instance, the recent work of ProxylessNAS (Cai et al., 2019) can generate a novel architecture with 10% less error rate and 5x fewer parameters than previous state-of-the-art generic architecture.
 With all its appeal for power efficiency, training SNNs still remains a challenge.
To date, all work on certifiable defenses has focused on deflecting `p-bounded attacks, where p = 2 or ∞ (Cohen et al., 2019; Gowal et al., 2018; Wong et al., 2018).
 In a usual translation model, the encoder first reads the entire sentence, then the decoder writes the target sentence.
 After learning, the per-sample activation of the network is considered as generic features.
To address the former challenge, transfer learning (Pan & Yang, 2009) is thus designed to transfer knowledge learned from the source task to a target dataset that has limited data samples.
 The problem of recovering xs, however, is a challenging task, in which the main difficulties are to incorporate the sparse constraint which is nonconvex and to further determine the indices of its non-zero elements, i.g,, the support of the vector.
The characterization of DL model expressive power, i.g,, to identify what function classes DL models can (approximately) represent, is a fundamental question in theoretical research of DL.
 Due to its flexibility, graph-like data structures can capture rich information which is critical in many applications.
Particularly concerning, however, have been a number of demonstrations that implement adversarial perturbations directly in physical objects that are subsequently captured by a camera, and then fed through the deep neural network classifier (Boloor et al., 2019; Eykholt et al., 2018; Athalye et al., 2018b; Brown et al., 2018; Bhattad et al., 2020).
 In general, x has structure (such as a sequence), but we can treat it as a ‘flat’ distribution, omitting the bold notation, so x has a categorical distribution over D given by p(x), x ∈ D.
Designing such models, however, usually involves trade-offs along the following dimensions: flexibility (can the model approximate any distribution?), efficiency (can the likelihood function be evaluated in closed form?), and ease of use (is sampling and computing summary statistics easy?).
 In the meantime, despite their superior performance, DNNs have been found extremely vulnerable to adversarial examples (or attacks), which are input examples slightly perturbed with an intention to fool the network to make a wrong prediction (Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2018; Bai et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; 2020).
One strong point of the multimodal NMT model is the ability to use visual information to improve the quality of the target translation.
 As illustrated in Figure 1, metric-based approaches consist of 1) a feature encoder and 2) a metric function.
The existing computational models, for instance deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), face two fundamental issues regarding incremental learning, 1) catastrophic forgetting (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989), which refers to the forgetting of previously acquired knowledge when learning new tasks as a result of interference between the old and new tasks, and 2) intransigence, which refers to the inability to acquire new knowledge while trying to preserve old knowledge (e.g, reducing the learning rate) Chaudhry et al., (2018).
 The rapidly growing field of algorithmic fairness has a vast literature that proposes various fairness metrics, characterizes the relationship between fairness metrics, and describes methods to build classifiers that satisfy these metrics (Chouldechova & Roth, 2018; Corbett-Davies & Goel, 2018).
 According to Hausman et al., (1976), the scheduling of labor in warehouses can be divided into three main components:• Pallet Assignment: The assignment of multiple items to the same pallet.
 Despite the fact that GNNs have recently been proven very efficient in many applications, their theoretical properties are not yet well-understood.
 These simple examples illustrate limitations of our understanding of DNNs.
 As shown in fig.  1a, these computations can be sufficient to detect and localize objects in scenes with little or no background clutter, or when an object “pops out” because of color, contrast, etc. (Nothdurft, 1991).
It has been discovered that there exists a visual correlation removal processes in animal brains.
 Therefore, unsupervised sequence transduction methods that require only non-parallel data are appealing and have been receiving growing attention (Bannard & Callison-Burch, 2005; Ravi & Knight, 2011; Mizukami et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2017; Lample et al., 2018; 2019).
 On this front, there has been much recent progress in solving physically grounded tasks, e.g, dexterous in-hand manipulation (Rajeswaran et al., 2017; Andrychowicz et al., 2018) or locomotion of complex bodies (Schulman et al., 2015; Heess et al., 2017).
 In contrast to architectures that are manually designed, those automatically found by neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms require much less human interaction and expert effort.
Pre-training has the potential to provide an attractive solution to the following two fundamental challenges with learning on graph datasets (Pan & Yang, 2009; Hendrycks et al., 2019): First, task-specific labeled data can be extremely scarce.
 Recently, Dinan et al., (2019) proposed to tackle the knowledge-grounded dialogue by decomposing it into two sub-problems: first selecting knowledge from a large pool of candidates and generating a response based on the selected knowledge and context.
 Furthermore, there is typically no gradient information available.
 Word embedding approaches such as word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) or GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) use instead vectors of dimensionality p much smaller than d to represent words, but the vectors are not necessarily extremely sparse nor mutually orthogonal.
 On the other hand is the rich history of rule-based methods (Appelt et al., 1993; Cunningham, 2002) where humans code-up their supervision as labeling rules.
 By predicting the potential energy these models effectively learn an empirical potential function.
 Due to its significant importance in wide range of application areas, its theoretical analysis is also getting much important.
 Most commonly, the parallelization is done by "data-parallelism" in which the data is divided into separate batches which are distributed between different devices during training.
 The key requirement is that the generating process is conditioned on a variable which is observed along with the data.
 Forms of structure such as sparsity have been at the forefront of recent advances in ML (Frankle & Carbin, 2019), and are critical for on-device and energy-efficient models, two application areas of tremendous recent interest (Tsidulko, 2019; Schwartz et al., 2019).
 As a result, training a state-of-the-art DNN model often demands considerable energy, along with the associated financial and environmental costs.
 Deep learning harnesses foundational tools from these mature parent fields.
 Such an approach has also been shown to reduce the number of training examples that is needed to achieve good performance on the task of interest (Yogatama et al., 2019).
 By adopting permutation-invariant aggregation functions (e.g, summation, maximum, and mean), MPNNs are able to learn representations which are invariant to isomorphic graphs, i.g,, graphs that are topologically identical.
 An example from engineering is queueing theory, where the queue lengths and waiting time under the limiting distribution have been extensively studied (Gross et al., 2018).
∗Equal contribution.
 There are several models typically used in language generation, namely sequenceto-sequence (seq2seq) models (Kalchbrenner & Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Vaswani et al., 2017), generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014), variational autoencoders (Kingma & Welling, 2013), and auto-regressive networks (Larochelle & Murray, 2011; Van Oord et al., 2016).
 Instead, formal verification of properties such as adversarial robustness becomes necessary.
 Thus, innovations in RNN architecture tend to have a trickle-down effect from language modelling, where evaluation is often the easiest and data the most readily available, to many other tasks, a trend greatly strengthened by ULMFiT (Howard and Ruder 2018), ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), which promote language models from architectural blueprints to pretrained building blocks.
 One potential explanation is that most downstream tasks are discriminative in nature and state-of-the-art generative models have diverged quite heavily from state-of-the-art discriminative architectures.
 In simple cases with small state and action spaces, value iteration can be ideal for efficient and accurate planning.
The prevalence of these issues points to a broader problem: we do not understand how the parts comprising deep RL algorithms impact agent training, either separately or as a whole.
 Yet, this is a highly restrictive setting, as in real-world scenarios, tasks that arrive at the model may have different training instances (task imbalance), and within each task, the number of training instances per class may largely vary (class imbalance).
 The bases can bond with one another to form a set of base-pairs, which defines the secondary structure.
 This is in contrast to the vast majority of works designed to tackle a high-dimensional feature space X (where commonly |X | |Y|, such as in standard classification problems).
 Transformer models are also used on increasingly long sequences.
 This progress relied importantly on the use of powerful and rich abstract computational models of self-organization (Kauffman, 1993).
 Attribution methods (Selvaraju et al., 2017; Zeiler & Fergus, 2014; Smilkov et al., 2017) aim to explain the model behavior by assigning a relevance score to each input variable.
 One means of doing so is to have the internal representation of a model serve as a component-parsing of an input across several semantic resolutions.
 A lot of recent research on neural models for TTS has focused on improving parallelism by predicting multiple time steps in parallel, e.g, using flow-based models (van den Oord et al., 2018; Ping et al., 2019; Prenger et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019).
 Moreover, conditional NPs (CNPs; Garnelo et al., 2018a), a deterministic variant of NPs, can be trained in a particularly simple way with maximum likelihood learning of the parameters θ, which mimics how the system is used at test time, leading to strong performance (Gordon et al., 2019).
 This method has also been able to train robust ImageNet models (Xie et al., 2019).
The typical federated learning paradigm involves two stages: (i) clients train models with their local datasets independently, and (ii) the data center gathers the locally trained models and aggregates them to obtain a shared global model.
 The priors can be learned from a spectrum of examples ranging from perfect demonstrative ones that accomplish certain tasks to aimless exploration.
 One grand challenge in scientific discovery is to perform high-throughput unsupervised interpretation of scientific data, given its exponential growth in generation rates, dramatically outpacing humans’ ability to analyze them.
 This is one of key problems in reinforcement learning for evaluating the value of a policy π.
 They derived a lower bound on the maximum number of linear regions.
 Solving these problems requires agents to learn several key capacities: spatial reasoning — to explore the environment in an efficient manner and to learn spatio-temporal regularities and affordances.
 This method, known as adversarial training, is however sensitive to distributional shifts between the inputs and their adversarial examples (Ilyas et al., 2019).
 On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that DNNs are capable of memorising the whole training data even when all training labels are random (Zhang et al., 2017).
 Accordingly, a myriad of techniques have been proposed as regularizers: weight decay (Hanson & Pratt, 1989) and other Lp penalties; dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) and stochastic depth (Huang et al., 2016), to name a few examples.
 The sample estimates can be either biased or unbiased.
 It is well known that in an RP Tree, data points that are closely distributed, indicating their high level of similarity in space, are always partitioned into the same subset Dasgupta & Freund (2008).
 Alternatively, for graph data, graph convolutional networks were suggested to leverage adjacency patterns present in datasets structured as a graph (Kipf & Welling, 2016; Xu et al., 2019).
 Use cases of model interpretability vary across applications: it can provide trust to users by showing rationales behind decisions, enable detection of systematic failure cases, and provide actionable feedback for improving models (Rudin, 2018).
 One needs to determine the samples that are most useful for the target task and then label them correctly.
Despite the recent rapid progress, these existing works often limited to one or few specific domains (in this paper, we mainly focus on three domains: artistic, semantic and photo-realistic).
Recently, deep learning techniques have emerged as powerful methods for learning feature representations automatically from data (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014; He et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017a).
 Corresponding to micro operations within a layer/block, the macro connections (Atwood & Towsley, 2016; Pérez-Rúa et al., 2018) between layers also experienced a series of evolutions.
 Although the adversarial example is semantically indistinguishable from the normal one, it can fool deep learning models and undermine the security of deep learning, causing reliability problems in autonomous driving, biometric authentication, etc.
 For example, in AudioSet (Gemmeke et al., 2017), one of the popular audio datasets, we often find audios/videos that contain content beyond what the label specifies1.
 Recently, generative adversarial learning (Goodfellow et al., 2014) provides a promising alternative solution to UDA problem.
 Notably, a human agent can quickly learn the correlation between its own action and the state change of an object, even without supervision, to later use the acquired skill to manipulate the object into the desired state.
 Among these work, beside “useritem” pairs, side information, e.g, user reviews and scores on items, are involved and have achieved remarkable success Menon et al., (2011); Fang & Si (2011).
 In recent years, network architecture search and design have shown major performance boosts in various aspects of deep learning 36, 35, 18, 8, 34.
 Consequently, there has been an ever-growing interest in the machine learning community to study this uncanny behaviour.
 Early work showed that simple algorithms (e.g, maximizing the classification loss with respect to the input using a single optimization iteration (Goodfellow et al., 2014)) can easily construct such adversaries.
To answer these question, it is necessary to have a better understanding of what these metrics actually measure, and how they relate to one another.
 In contrast to the mere implementation of spatial information and complicated float point computation of ANNs, SNNs utilize spatial-temporal dynamics to mimic the bio-behavior of neurons, as well as its dyadic-valued computation whose feeding electrical sequential impulses (i.g,, spikes), belong to the binary-like set of {0,1}.
 Moreover, WeightNorm has the advantage of not requiring a batch setting, therefore considerably reducing the computational overhead that is imposed by BatchNorm 16.
There are mainly two types of models for graph representation learning.
 The depthwise convolution applies a separate 2D convolution kernel for each input channel, and the pointwise convolution changes the channel size using 1×1 convolution (details in Section 2.1).
A few comments about this setting are in order.
 Existing studies have been focused on speeding up the execution of CNNs for inference on edge devices by model compression using matrix decomposition (Denil et al., 2013; Masana et al., 2017), network quantization (Courbariaux et al., 2016), network pruning (Dong et al., 2017), etc.
 Hence, different research directions have been explored.
 However, while many researchers have provided solid theoretical guarantees on the convergence of SGD (Kingma & Ba (2014); Reddi et al., (2018); Sutskever et al., (2013)), the assumptions of their proofs cannot be applied to problems involving deep neural networks, which are highly nonsmooth and nonconvex.
 This gap is also referred to as the reality gap Collins et al., (2018).
 Thus, for interactive applications and live performances, the generation of the high temporal-resolution audio (i.g,, 44.1 kHz) in real-time has to meet the standard of human perceptual sensitivity to sound.
 There are numerous approaches, (Kim et al., 2018; Erhan et al., 2009; Zeiler & Fergus, 2013; Simonyan et al., 2013), that bring post-hoc explainability of decisions to already-trained models.
 However, in the meantime not much work has explored the learning of representations for the more general problem of MFSR to address the additional challenges of co-registration and fusion of multiple low-resolution images.
ML practitioners often rely on their understanding of model architecture to determine a reasonable partitioning and placement for graphs.
One of the implicit assumptions that many practitioners adhere to is that models that can distinguish isomorphic instances from non-isomorphic ones possess higher expressiveness in classification problem and hence much efforts have been devoted to incorporate efficient graph isomorphism methods into the classification models.
 However, the understanding of modern neural networks is way behind their broad applications.
 Sampling a distribution, as opposed to optimizing a loss, is less prone to overfitting and more training doesn’t decrease test performance.
 In Hinton et al., (2015), the authors suggested to generate a soft target by a heavy-duty teacher network to guide the training of a light-weighted student network.
This work rather deals with the final classification step, more precisely how to train neural classifiers in an unsupervised way.
 Direct computation of the posterior is often intractable on large datasets, motivating people to consider its approximations.
 The algorithms assume that there is a smooth transition of meaning at the word-level, thus they learn to assign higher similarity for adjacent word vectors than those that are not adjacent.
 However RANSAC-based approaches are limited to matching pairs of images, which can lead to global inconsistencies in the matching.
 To facilitate learning with gradient descent, Batch Normalization (BN) was proposed in (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015), which has been found very effective in deep learning.
 Such a method is proved to achieve an O(1/k2/3) global convergence rate and thus needs O(n/ 1.5) stochastic first- and second-order oracle queries, namely the evaluation number of stochastic gradient and Hessian, to achieve a point that satisfies (2).
 However, not only the task relatedness but the relative reliability of the task-specific knowledge also matters, and recent asymmetric multi-task learning models Lee et al., (2016; 2017) tackle this challenge by allowing tasks with low loss to transfer more.
 Unsupervised pre-trained models based on the Post-LN Transformer architecture also show impressive performance in many downstream tasks (Radford et al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019).
 Actually, along with this line a variety of works, such as layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016), instance normalization (Ulyanov et al., 2016), weight normalization(Salimans & Kingma, 2016) and group normalization (Wu & He, 2018), batch renormalization, (Ioffe, 2017) were sequently proposed and also have made great success.
 When practitioners apply DNNs to data that include a large amount of user information (such as images with usernames (Edwards & Storkey, 2016) or data from wearables (Iwasawa et al., 2017)), the desired representations should not include user identifying information.
 They could provide their policies to a new robot (Devin et al., 2017), even though their dynamics factors, on which the policies are implicitly conditioned, are not typically available (Chen et al., 2018).
 These simulations are the basis for a wide range of applications ranging from blood flow simulations to aircraft design.
 Unlike in the applications of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to image datasets, the training loss of GNN on molecular dataset does not decrease consistently with the number of layers nor number of nodes per layers (cf.fig.4 in the appendix, thin dashed lines), and this seems to happen to numerous GNN architectures that are used in applications today (Duvenaud et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016; Kipf & Welling, 2017; Xu et al., 2019; Busbridge et al., 2018).
 The loss penalizes cases where the anchor is mapped closer to the negative image than it is to the positive image.
 That is, they often do not correctly associate generated words with the appropriate image regions (e.g, objects) in the scene, resulting in models that lack interpretability.
 However, unlike computer vision problems, physical fields are often constrained by PDEs that arise from the governing equations of the physical system.
 On the other hand, robust models, trained with adversarial learning algorithms (with or without provable robustness to adversarial examples), do not offer privacy protections to the training data.
The efficiency and effectiveness of the similarity search approaches have become a problem of great interest, due to the widespread commercial value and the exciting prospect.
 Even what RNN expresses is not totally clear.
 We usually divide recognition of MEs into handwritten and printed domains.
To tackle the sparse reward problems, it is crucial to incentivize the agent’s exploration behavior.
 How to obtain the optimal depth for a DNN still remains mysterious.
 Recently, there has been a growing interest in efficient network design (Howard et al., 2017; Iandola et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018; Sandler et al., 2018) and neural architecture search (NAS) (Zoph et al., 2018; Real et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018b), respectively with the objective of devising network architectures that are efficient during inference and automating the architecture design process.
 To overcome this challenge, previous work proposed to use grids (Redmon et al., 2016; He et al., 2017; Detone et al., 2018) to simplify the formulation by isolating each instance (Yi et al., 2016), or to optimize over multiple branches (Ono et al., 2018).
 Thus, a great deal of effort has been devoted to developing defensive techniques for it.
Motivated by the success of AT, one follow-up question that naturally arises is: Beyond AT, can other types of min-max formulation and optimization techniques advance the research in adversarial robustness? In this paper, we give an affirmative answer corroborated by the substantial performance gain and the ability of self-learned risk interpretation using our proposed min-max framework on several tasks for adversarial attack and defense.
 In stark contrast, human cognitive system is capable of acquiring new knowledge without damaging previously learned experiences.
 Lifelong learning models with continual learning ability can be deployed in complex environments with the aim to process a continuous stream of information.
 However, regular CNNs are not equivariant to other important group transformations such as rescaling and rotation, and it is beneficial in some applications to also encode such group information explicitly into the network representation.
To reduce the memory footprint and MAC of modern ConvNets, recent works propose either unstructured pruning (a.k.a. weight pruning) to prune redundant weights LeCun et al., (1990); Han et al., (2015; 2016); Zhu & Gupta (2017); Guo et al., (2016); Louizos et al., (2017a;b); Frankle & Carbin (2019); Lee et al., (2019); Gale et al., (2019) or structured pruning (e.g, filter-wise, channel-wise, depth-wise, etc.) to prune filters/channels/layers Li et al., (2016); Wen et al., (2016); Liu et al., (2017); Ye et al., (2018); Neklyudov et al., (2017); Gordon et al., (2018); He et al., (2018); Véniat & Denoyer (2018); He et al., (2019); Lemaire et al., (2019); Li et al., (2019); Yang et al., (2019) from original over-parameterized deep networks, without incurring significant loss in accuracy.
 Given the destinations of prospective demands, platforms can predict the number of drivers transferring from busy to idle status.
 Popular techniques include experience reuse/replay, which leads to powerful off-policy algorithms (e.g, (Mnih et al., 2013; Silver et al., 2014; Van Hasselt et al., 2015; Nachum et al., 2018a; Espeholt et al., 2018)), and model-based algorithms (e.g, (Hafner et al., 2018; Kaiser et al., 2019)).
 They take a completely different approach from the conventional methods that either uses thresholding or sparsity-inducing norms on parameters, and uses well-known dropout regularization instead.
 k-means has been extensively studied in the literature, and some heuristics have been proposed to approximate it (Jain, 2010; Dubes & Jain, 1988).
 However, computing the likelihood in flow-based models is expensive and usually requires restrictive constraints on the architecture in order to reduce the cost of computation.
 However, the meta-learning setup introduces a new overfitting problem: the model may overfit to the distribution of tasks seen during training.
 It becomes more urgent as the growth of privacy and security concerns about running the inference on cloud platforms.
 Literally, the generator generates simulated data, while the discriminator tries to discriminate between simulated data and real data.
In many domains, automated predictions have a real impact on the final decision, such as treatment options in the field of medicine.
 Compared with traditional methods (Wang & Manning (2012)) that rely on hand-crafted features, deep learning methods are employed to learn features from texts by a variety of neural network structures, especially recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), and attention mechanisms.
 Denote the discriminator as f and a generator as g.
In its simplest form, the problem of modeling disease progressions is to fit the curve of y(t), t ∈ tmin, tmax for each patient, given sparse observations y := (ỹ(t1), . , ỹ(tn)).
 While certain prior knowledge was successfully imposed – for example translational symmetry through convolutional architectures (LeCun et al., 1998) – incorporating more general modeling assumptions in the training of deep networks remains an open challenge.
In current deep learning, deep artificial neural networks are typically trained using supervised learning, with variants of the error-backpropagation (EBP) rule.
 model-based planning algorithms, which plan with the estimated dynamics Nagabandi et al., (2018); Chua et al., (2018); Wang & Ba (2019).
 One main challenge in I2I translation is the multi-modal nature for many such tasks – the relation between an input domain A and an output domain B is often times one-to-many, where a single input image IAi ∈ A can be mapped to different output images from domain B.
State-of-the-art approaches for image captioning (Liu et al., 2018a;b; Anderson et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2018) are based on encoder-decoders with visual attention.
 These methods may have some limitations: the solution is numeric and may suffer from high condition number, highly dependent on the discretization and even the second derivative is sensitive to noise, see for example Garcia (2017); LeVeque (2007); Thomas (1995); Reddy (2005) and references therein.
 Such attack has proven effective towards ASR systems using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Lamere et al., (2003)), while recently, ASR systems based on deep neural networks can also be targeted by adversarial examples that slightly perturb the original inputs (Carlini et al., (2016)).
 The learning rate also determines the kind of minima (e.g, wide vs narrow) attained (Keskar et al., (2016)), which has a significant impact on the generalization accuracy.
 Therefore, applying GNNs to huge graphs is challenging.
 Binomial bandit is the most common bandit formats by restricting the rewards being binary (Xt ∈ {0, 1}).
Recent efforts on learning cross-domain invariant representations using deep networks generally fall into two categories.
 Data augmentation(DA) ameliorates such issues by enlarging the original data set and making more effective use of the information in existing data.
 Deep neural networks are unfortunately not immune to these perturbations as their intrinsic ability to memorize and learn label noise (Zhang et al., 2017) can be the cause of training robustness issues and poor generalization performance.
 Graphs are widely used to model irregularly structured data, such as social networks (Kipf & Welling, 2016), protein interaction networks (Fout et al., 2017), citation and knowledge graphs (Hamaguchi et al., 2017).
Consequently, a diagnostic model constructed at one location may not be directly applicable to another location without proper adjustment.
One of the most common ways to leverage multilingual data is to use transfer learning. Word embeddings such as Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013b) or GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) use large amounts of unsupervised data to create task-agnostic word embeddings which have been shown to greatly improve downstream task performance.
Min-max (robust) optimization is a natural framework to address adversarial (worst-case) robustness (Madry et al., 2017b; Al-Dujaili et al., 2018b).
As it stands today, the main obstacle in the path of effective continual learning is the problem of catastrophic forgetting: machines trained on new problems forget about the tasks that they were previously trained on.
One way to reduce the number of parameters in the trained model is to imply a specific structure on its weight matrices (e.g, assume that they are low-rank or can be well approximated by low-rank tensor networks).
 Self attention models also have found applications in vision (Wang et al., 2018), adversarial networks (Zhang et al., 2018), reinforcement learning (Zambaldi et al., 2018; Li, 2017) and speech recognition (Chiu et al., 2018).
Text-to-speech (TTS) is an underdetermined problem, meaning the same text input has an infinite number of reasonable spoken realizations.
 The text sequence is generated by a decoder network left-to-right, one token (word or word-piece or character) at a time and are widely used in text generation tasks such as summarization (Liu et al., 2018), machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014) and dialog response generation (Budzianowski et al., 2018) in the encoder-decoder (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014) setting.
 Previous work offer theoretical explanation based on Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI; Church & Hanks (1990)) for maintaining the analogic relations in word vectors (Levy & Goldberg, 2014b; Arora et al., 2016; Gittens et al., 2017; Ethayarajh et al., 2019; Allen & Hospedales, 2019).
 For instance, consider the task of training an attention model (Vaswani et al., 2017) using BERT (Devlin et al., 2018).
 Adversarial networks and autoencoders have been extended into 3-D and have shown they are able to encode useful representations of everyday objects (Wu et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2018; Brock et al., 2016; Achlioptas et al., 2017; Valsesia et al., 2018; Meng et al., 2019; Maturana & Scherer, 2015).
 Moreover, recent studies (Kovaleva et al., 2019) also demonstrate that there is redundancy in PLMs.
 Since the popular NASNet paper (Zoph & Le, 2017), there has been a flurry of research on neural architecture search (Liu et al., 2018a; Pham et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018b; Kandasamy et al., 2018; Elsken et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2018; Sciuto et al., 2019; Cortes et al., 2017; Baker et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017).
 The majority of research efforts in quantization have been devoted to develop better quantization algorithms such that an iso-figure-of-merit (i.g,, accuracy) is achieved with lowest possible weight precision value.
 The rest are just details.
 Despite their success, training GANs can be challenging, partly because they are trained by solving a saddle point optimization problem formulated as an adversarial game.
 Other methods like imitation learning (Ye & Alterovitz, 2017; Aleotti & Caselli, 2006; Lawitzky et al., 2012) generalize badly to large scale demonstration data.
 First, the deep network can improve the ability to extract abstract features (Zeiler & Fergus, 2013), which are important for some vision tasks, such as object detection (Girshick, 2015; Ren et al., 2017) and classification.
Existing methods can be broadly classified into two groups (Ruder et al., 2017): mapping methods leverage existing monolingual embeddings which are treated as independent, and apply a postprocess step to map the embeddings of each language into a shared space, through a linear transformation (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Conneau et al., 2017; Joulin et al., 2018).
Among the several challenges involved in graph generation tasks described above, scalability is one of the most important for applications in a wide range of real-world domains.
The use of pre-trained models gives rise to two different problems.
 Population based algorithms (Gaier & Ha, 2019; Liang et al., 2018; Jaderberg et al., 2017) are another popular approach for NAS, new trials could inherit neural architecture from better performing ones as well as their weights, and mutate the architecture to explore better ones.
 The effect of large mini-batches in the context of deep learning is well-studied (Smith et al., 2017; Goyal et al., 2017; Keskar et al., 2016; Shallue et al., 2018) and general consensus is that they can be helpful in many circumstances, but the results of Brock et al., (2018) suggest that GANs benefit disproportionately from large batches.
 These priors can be obtained by analyzing basic properties of natural images, and categorized as “unsupervised image modeling”.
Early approaches focus on computing the similarities among graphs to build a graph kernel for graph classification (Gärtner et al., 2003; Kashima et al., 2003; Borgwardt & Kriegel, 2005; Shervashidze et al., 2009; Vishwanathan et al., 2010; Shervashidze et al., 2011; Yanardag & Vishwanathan, 2015; Narayanan et al., 2017; Ivanov & Burnaev, 2018).
 On the other hand, over-parameterization does not necessarily result in a bad generalization or overfitting (Zhang et al., 2017), especially when some weight-size dependent complexities are controlled (Bartlett, 1997; Bartlett et al., 2017; Golowich et al., 2018; Neyshabur et al., 2019).
 Since the capacity of over-parameterized networks largely depends on the number of total parameters, the number of filters and layers of networks are the key hyper-parameters that shape the expressive power of neural networks.
 However, the quality of the sampling procedure also determines the final performance of the agent.
In spite of large number of speakers, Amharic is one of the under-resourced languages in that it needs many linguistic tools to be developed in general and dependency parser in particular.
 The context is composed of static information of the patient (such as age and weight); the state is composed of the patient’s dynamic measurements (such as heart rate and blood pressure); and the clinician’s actions are a set of intervention categories (e.g, infusion).
 For example, it may not be possible to store the old data because of privacy issues (health records, sensible data) or memory limitations (embedded systems, very large datasets).
 In this paper, the use of positron annihilation gamma photon imaging positron emission imaging technology for industrial nondestructive testing is studied.
 Previous generative models for molecules deal with string representations called SMILES (e.g, Kusner et al., (2017); Gómez-Bombarelli et al., (2018)), which does not consider graph topology.
 From a pruning viewpoint, since the separable convolution structure results from applying aggressive pruning to normal convolution, the result is drastic reductions in memory and computational cost at the expense of greatly decreased accuracy (Stock et al., 2019).
 Specifically, the exploding and vanishing gradient phenomena have been observed in various deep architectures.
 However this usually necessitates more complex learning and inference procedures that rely on variational approximations or sampling.
 Specifically, we focus on generating code in context: given a program P and some part of the program p, predict p from the rest of the program P−=P\\\\p.
1The results on these benchmarks are impressive, but sometimes lead to excessive optimism regarding the ability of current NLU models.
 Vapnik, 2000), thus it cannot always be applied to real-world problem directly.
 Recent developments for time-series data focus on finding a representation of the state zt and model the time-behaviour żt implicitely.
Challenges arise in carrying out these tasks.
 For instance, images and audio signals are known to be compressible in their frequency domain and machine learning algorithms have been shown to perform exceedingly well on classification tasks that take such signals as input (Krizhevsky et al., (2012); Sutskever et al., (2014)).
 The representation for AE models is unconstrained and typically places data objects close to each other according to an implicit similarity measure that also yields favorable reconstruction error.
 To overcome this issue, many researches have been conducted to develop smaller but accurate neural networks.
 Therefore beyond the main research stream, there are also works devoted to investigating effective attacks (Goodfellow et al., 2014; MoosaviDezfooli et al., 2016; Kurakin et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018) and designing adversarial robust models (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Miyato et al., 2015; Madry et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019).
 Though recent UDA work has made great progress, it has mostly failed to address the case of Shift in Label Distribution, i.g,, a changing prior over the labels.
 One solution is based on the assumption that the relational structure has repeated regularities; this assumption is implicitly or explicitly used in most works on statistical relational learning.
 The most popular example is the build of ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009).
 It is known that Differential privacy (DP) (Dwork et al., 2006a;b) is a golden standard for privacy preserving data analysis.
 For example, the commonly used Kalman-Filter tracking algorithm (Blackman, 2004) requiring variance estimation for the observed object’s location estimation.
 One of the first general approaches reaching reasonable performance on many Atari games while using the exact same hyper-parameters and neural network architecture was Deep Q-Network (DQN) (Mnih et al., 2015), a value based DRL algorithm which directly takes the raw image as input.
 Moreover, the dosage levels used when choosing between multiple treatments for a patient are crucial for the decision (Rothwell et al., 2018).
 As a result, there is an urging need by both research and industry for a scalable model/HW/SW evaluation platform.
Learning from noisy labels allows using large-scale data and labels from the web without human annotation effort.
Despite the successes of policy gradient method, suffering from high sample complexity is still a critical challenge for RL.
 By treating the output of each hidden layer as a random variable T , one can model the MI I(X;T ) between X and T .
 Personalization in FL poses many challenges due to its distributed nature, high communication costs, and privacy constraints (Li et al., 2019a; Bonawitz et al., 2019; Caldas et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019b; 2018; Liu et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Konen et al., 2016a).
 Transfer from such simulated training environments to the real world is known as crossing the reality gap in robotics, and is well known to be difficult, thus providing an important motivation for studying generalization.
 These maliciously crafted examples are known as adversarial examples, which have caused serious concerns over the reliability and security of deep learning systems, particularly when deployed in the life-critical scenarios, such as autonomous driving systems and health/medical domains.
 Zhang et al., (2016; 2015); Guan et al., (2017); Guan & Cham (2017).
 As a consequence, adversarial perturbations fool classifiers while the correct class remains clear to humans.
 This paper mainly solves the problem of non-fixed number of vehicle keypoint detection, which is the basis of vehicle automatic driving perception technology.
 However, while they are often used by practitioners, there are cases where their use leads to a performance gap (Wilson et al., 2017; Shah et al., 2018).
 All of these blocks utilized depthwise separable convolution, which deconstructed the standard convolution with the (3 × 3 × C) size for each kernel into spatial information specific depthwise convolution (3 × 3 × 1) and channel information specific pointwise (1 × 1 × C) convolution.
Given the remarkable success of this recipe for supervised learning, there is significant interest in automating the end-to-end process of applying DNNs to real-world problems (Wong et al., 2018; He et al., 2018; 2019).
 Thus, how to imitate such a human cognitive ability and effectively learn robust representations from massive sums of unlabeled data in an unsupervised manner have attracted the interests of machine learning researchers.
 After the metric learning is completed, the problem is reduced as easy memory-based learning.
Along with practical importance, a key benefit of accurate generative models is a more complete understanding of the internal structure of the data.
 Additionally, when the cost function c is related to a distance function d by c(x, y) = dp(x, y), p ≥ 1, the OT formulation defines the so called Wasserstein metric, which is a distance on the space of probability measures, i.g,a symmetric and positive definite function that satisfies the triangle inequality.
 However, due to unexpected sensor damages or communication errors, missing data is unavoidable.
 However, LfD yields a strong dependency on the assumption of demonstration optimality, which is usually inconsistent with the reality.
 That is scale variation, since Convolutional Neural Network is sensitive to scales.
Quantization schemes based on binary codes are gaining increasing attention since quantized weights follow specific constraints to allow simpler computations during inference.
 However, even in the current settings where flexibility is limited by expertlydesigned search spaces, NAS problems are computationally very intensive with early methods requiring hundreds or thousands of GPU-days to discover state-of-the-art architectures (Zoph and Le, 2017; Real et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018a;b).
The softmax layer has been identified as one potential culprit for these overconfident predictions (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2017; Neumann et al., 2018).
 Historically, the prevalent approach to handling missing data has been to apply a preprocessing step to replace the missing observations with substituted values and then treat the time series as though it were complete (Schafer & Graham, 2002).
 Contextual bandit algorithms have been applied to many real-world applications, such as personalized recommendation, advertising and Web search (e.g, Agarwal et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010).
 Therefore, sufficient testing for DL models is critical for ensuring system quality.
 However, a lack in diversity is especially common when the condition itself is an image,and special precautions have to be taken to avoid mode collapse and training stability continues to pose a challenge.
 In this work, we specifically investigate the effect of the number of neurons on the quality of the learned representations.
 For instance, data points associated with objects in the distance are difficult to identify due to sparsity.
 Such process ensures a basic level of grammaticality and accuracy, but also limit the model to copying.
 Moreover, to overcome the closed world assumption, inclusion of a ”background” class is veritably insufficient as it is impossible to include all unseen concepts and classes explicitly in the loss function beforehand.
 The popular belief Chen et al., (2018) is that by adding weights to this term in objective function, a VAE model can learn a disentangled representation.
 Semisupervised learning (Thomas, 2009) is proposed to address this problem by training classifiers with sufficient unlabeled data and a small fraction of labeled data.
Many have observed that used blindly, the maximum softmax probability of a network does a poor job of predicting uncertainty (Nguyen & O’Connor, 2015; Provost et al., 1998; Nguyen et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2011; Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017).
 At all times during the lifetime of the model, predictions on examples from all tasks can be requested.
 One way towards this goal is disentangled representation learning which aims to capture the independent and interpretable generative factors of the data.
 However, simulators only represent approximations of a physical system.
 The straight-forward extension does not apply by two reasons: (1) the lengths of x and y are radically different, and (2) both x and y are high dimensionals.
 Given the importance of metric representations of data sets, we focus on metric constrained problems, a class of optimization problems with metric constraints; i.g,, optimization of a convex function subject to metric constraints, such as the triangle inequality, on all the output variables.
Following the empirical success of dropout, there have been several studies in recent years that focus on understanding theoretical underpinnings of dropout (Baldi & Sadowski, 2013; Wager et al., 2013; McAllester, 2013; Van Erven et al., 2014; Helmbold & Long, 2015; Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Gao & Zhou, 2016; Mou et al., 2018; Bank & Giryes, 2018; Cavazza et al., 2018; Mianjy et al., 2018).
However, there are several challenges with the existing work on better data usage strategies.
 This has strengthened the emergence of easy questions in the sense of Sugawara et al., (2018) and influenced the recent state-of-the-art models to be good at detecting patterns and named entities (Devlin et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017).
 Semi-supervised learning develops techniques that benefit from an abundance unlabeled of data for training.
 Wu & Dredze (2019) show the potential of multilingual-BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) in zero-shot transfer for a large number of languages from different language families on five NLP tasks, namely, natural language inference, document classification, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing.
 Nevertheless, the cost of this flexibility is the large number of environment interactions (samples) required for a randomly-initialized network to learn behaviour policies from raw experience.
 PCA aims to maintain the second-order statistics of the data by projecting the points into the low dimensional space that preserves the maximum amount of variance among all such projections.
 Here, f : X → Y denotes the function represented by a neural network.
 DP-SGD is now the de facto algorithm used for training neural networks with privacy guarantees.
 To tackle this issue, we extend a standard game of information aggregation on a social network, see Mossel et al., (2015), to accommodate fake news and solve this, analytically intractable, game using deep multi-agent reinforcement learning.
Meta Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been proposed as a framework for pre-training in RL (Wang et al., 2016a; Duan et al., 2016; Finn et al., 2017).
In 3D CNNs the time axis is treated just like a third spatial axis, whereas C-LSTMs only allow for information flow in the direction of increasing time, complying with the second law of thermodynamics.
This paradigm of learning is attractive for the fundamental reason that it resembles how an intelligent system in the real-world has to behave.
 DNA fragments found in those samples can be sequenced using various sequencing technologies, such as Illumina, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore (Quail et al., 2012).
 We will additionally connect the task of lattice representation learning with a well known technique in generative modeling using variational autoencoders; specifically, Gaussian approximate posteriors (Kingma & Welling, 2014).
 Despite their superior performance in semi-supervised node classification and/or regression, they didn’t allow to deal with various types of uncertainties.
 With recent advancement of neural networks, neural models with encoder-decoder architectures has obtained impressive improvements (Dong & Lapata, 2016; Jia & Liang, 2016; Herzig & Berant, 2017; Su & Yan, 2017; B.
 Interestingly, such classifiers can achieve good performance on test sets which share the same non-robust features.
 The aggregation of d-dimension gradients from P workers requires a communication complexity of O(d) in terms of communication traffics1, which generally limits the system scalability.
Current MBRL methods, however, still have limitations because the accuracy of the learned dynamics model is usually not satisfied, especially in complex environments (Zhang et al., 2018; Lowrey et al., 2018).
 Moreover, current symbolic regression techniques fail to exploit a key value of mathematical expressions that has traditionally been well used by natural scientists.
 The adversarial perturbations can arbitrarily change the network’s prediction but often too small to affect human recognition (Szegedy et al., 2013; Kurakin et al., 2016).
 Compared to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), VI is biased but more computationally efficient, making it particularly suitable to large-scale models in deep learning such as Bayesian neural networks and deep generative models.
It is generally known that deep neural networks can make predictions for out-of-distribution (OOD) examples with high confidence (Nguyen et al., 2015).
Classical stochastic optimization theory predicts that the learning rate of SGD needs to decrease over time for convergence to be guaranteed to the minimizer of a convex function (Shamir & Zhang, 2013; Bertsekas, 2011).
In a nutshell, consistency training methods simply regularize model predictions to be invariant to small noise applied to either input examples (Miyato et al., 2018; Sajjadi et al., 2016; Clark et al., 2018) or hidden states (Bachman et al., 2014; Laine & Aila, 2016).
 This property is usually satisfied in supervised deep learning because of the empirical success of over-parameterized architectures.
 However the ground truth data acquisition is costly, usually requiring extensive campaign preparation, people and equipment transportation, and in-field gathering of the characteristics under question.
We focus on the tasks of video synthesis and video prediction (defined in Section 2.1), and aim to extend the strong results of generative image models to the video domain.
 Even in a black box threat model, where the adversary has no access to the model parameters, attackers could target autonomous vehicles by using stickers or paint to create an adversarial stop sign that the vehicle would interpret as a yield or another sign (Papernot et al., 2016).
 Training a multi-task model should require less data, fewer training iterations, and fewer total parameters than training an equivalent set of task-specific models.
 Warm-start, a method in which weights from one neural network are transferred to another, has been reasonably successful for supervised learning.
 For example, consider the image understanding task – variants of convolutional layers with residual connections, e.g, the notable ResNet (He et al., 2015) architecture, can yield reasonably good performance on a new image dataset (e.g, in medical imaging) or a slightly different visual recognition problem (e.g, segmentation).
Besides, extensive studies (Hu et al., 2018b; Bertinetto et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017; Jia et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2019b; Zhu et al., 2019) have proven that other advanced operations for feature self-calibration, such as attention learning and dynamic convolutions, can bring great benefits for representation learning.
 Several lines of work in machine learning take this cost into account and attempt to reduce the dependence on large quantities of labeled data.
Recent advances in deep learning and NLP, however, challenge this long-held belief.
 However, when the nodes of the graphs are not labeled/attributed or the labels/attributes of the nodes do not carry information about the differences between the nodes or any information about their locations in the graph, the GNN can fail to extract discriminative features.
 Indeed, data augmentation and adversarial training have shown improvements in both the generalization and robustness of DNNs (Kurakin et al., 2016; Perez & Wang, 2017; Madry et al., 2017).
 Recently, a series of remarkable papers (Chizat & Bach, 2018; Mei et al., 2018; Rotskoff & Vanden-Eijnden, 2018; Sirignano & Spiliopoulos, 2018) analyze the two-layer neural networks using mean field models and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
We pose this design-under-constraints problem as sampling from a Gibbs distribution defined on some compact support.
 These methods are tremendously computationally-intensive, requiring significant computational resources and expertise.
 An agent able to compute online a similarity measure between source tasks and the current target task should be able to perform transfer.
 Lately, MIPS has also been applied to training tasks such as scalable gradient computation in large output spaces (Yen et al., 2018), efficient sampling for speeding up softmax computation (Mussmann and Ermon, 2016) and sparse updates in end-to-end trainable memory systems (Pritzel et al., 2017).
 These findings inspired recent research on noisy data.
 In this work we are interested in the problem of link prediction in knowledge hypergraphs.
Building adversarially robust models is an optimization problem with two objectives: (i) maintain test accuracy on clean unperturbed images, and (ii) be robust to large adversarial perturbations.
 Recent studies reveal that deep networks still face robustness issues when input that cannot be properly represented by learned knowledge is given to the networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2018; Liang et al., 2017).
The interplay between a node’s metadata and edges is a rich and active area of research.
Machine learning has been used to address aspects of this challenge.
 There has been a recent surge of interest in developing text style transfer models using non-parallel data (Hu et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018; Prabhumoye et al., 2018; Subramanian et al., 2018), assuming that disentangling style information from semantic content can be achieved in an auto-encoding fashion with the introduction of additional regularizers (e.g, adversarial discriminators (Shen et al., 2017) or language models (Yang et al., 2018)).
 It is typically implemented by training critics that approximate the value of the joint observations and actions, which are used to train actors restricted to the observation of a single agent.
In practice, adversarial training and its variants (Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Madry et al., 2018), i.g,, training on adversarial examples, can be regarded as the state-of-the-art to obtain models robust against adversarial examples.
 However, many of them are built on heuristic strategies, which are thus easily bypassed by stronger adversaries (Athalye et al., 2018).
When the nodes of a network have attributes (or features), their embeddings can be used to capture information about the attributes in their local neighbourhood.
 For example, a big transformer with 6 layers, 1024 dim and 16 heads has∼ 100M parameters, which can make production deployment impractical, especially on mobile devices.
 Such examples are often referred to as being out-of-distribution (OOD), and while their existence has been well-known for some time, the challenges of identifying them and a baseline method to do so in a variety of tasks such as image classification, text classification, and speech recognition were presented by Hendrycks and Gimpel (2017).
However, there are two main drawbacks of existing deep graph generative models.
 Tree search methods enable powerful explorations of the action space in a way which is guided by the topology of the search space, focusing on branches (actions) that are more promising.
 That is, when performing the task of object detection, objects’ class labels should be inferred with respect to other objects in the scene.
 In particular, one of the most popular neural TTS pipelines consists of two components (Ping et al., 2018b; Shen et al., 2018): (i) an autoregressive seq2seq model that generates mel spectrogram from text, and (ii) an autoregressive neural vocoder (e.g, WaveNet) that generates raw waveform from mel spectrogram.
 In the biomedical domain, NER and RE facilitate large-scale biomedical data analysis, such as network biology (Zhou et al., 2014), gene prioritization (Aerts et al., 2006), drug repositioning (Wang & Zhang, 2013) and the creation of curated databases (Li et al., 2015).
 The sub-field of neural architecture search (NAS) addresses the problem of designing competitive architectures with as small computational budget as possible.
 Many defense methods have also been developed to prevent CNNs from misclassification when facing adversarial attacks.
 For example, GAN suffers non-stability, mode collapse, and generative distortion during training.
 On the other hand, the model makes predictions based on its internal representation (i.g, what the model perceives) which may be very different from human perception.
In response to the challenge of interpretability, two paths are taken to unbox neural networks’ decision learning process.
 The filter learning and the inference processes need resources such as GPU or TPUs to tackle the computational overhead.
White-box attacks need training data and the gradient information of models, such as FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method) (Goodfellow et al., 2015), BIM (Basic Iterative Method) (Kurakin et al., 2017a) and JSMA (Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack) (Papernot et al., 2016b).
 Therefore, unsupervised clustering methods are one of the few viable approaches to gain insight into the structure of these massive unlabeled datasets.
 BERT and its varieties are the state-of-the-art for many kinds of NLP tasks.
 In other words, if there are some spots/stains in LR inputs, the SR model will treat them as inherent elements, and the corresponding SR outputs will enlarge these undesirable details.
 In addition, generative probabilistic models may include capabilities to perform density estimation or inference of latent variables.
 For decades, this task has been solved using template-based approaches (Gelernter et al., 1990; Satoh & Funatsu, 1999).
 That is, generalizing to data distributions that do not necessarily correspond to the training distribution, such as longer sequences and new values.
 A robot arm must reason about occluded objects when reaching into a cluttered shelf.
 This is the assumption that high-dimensional data lies on a single low-dimensional manifold which smoothly varies and where local Euclidean distances in the low-dimensional space correspond to complex transformations in the high-dimensional space.
Due to its importance in both theory and practice, many algorithms have been developed for the TSP, mostly based on traditional operations research (OR) methods.
 Thus, the algorithm must be able to learn offline first, from a static batch of data, without the ability to explore.
 Although its penultimate layer might be treated as an embedding, the classifier’s training objective attempts to orthogonalize all classes and thereby eliminate any information about inter-class structure.
 Under the RL setting, a robot learns behavioral policy by maximizing the expected rewards that are estimated by interacting with the environment physically and/or virtually.
 This technique is essential for reaching state-of-the-art performance, as LMbased systems are able to achieve much better results than techniques that only use a small, labeled dataset.
 This limits the privacy advantages of running models on-device and results in static models that do not adapt to evolving data distributions in the field.
Accurate classification of pixels in close proximity to inter-class boundaries remains a challenging task in image segmentation.
 As a result, source code contains substantial information that can be exploited by machine-learning algorithms.
 Yet due to limited capacity, these interpretable models cannot approximate the behavior of neural networks globally.
There have been some successes in learning propositional logic reasoning (Selsam et al., 2019; Amizadeh et al., 2019), which focus on SAT (Boolean Satisfiability) problems as defined below.
 While offering a standardized solution, simple batch learning often fails to find solutions that are simultaneously stable, highly generalizable and scalable to large systems (Das et al., (2016); Keskar et al., (2016); Goyal et al., (2017); You et al., (2017)).
 The repository of deep generative modeling majorly includes Likelihood based models such as autoregressive models (Oord et al., 2016b; Graves, 2013), latent variable models (Kingma & Welling, 2013), flow based models (Dinh et al., 2014; 2016; Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018) and implicit models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014).
 One critique about MFRL is that it does not fully exploit past queries over the environment, and this motivates us to consider the model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL).
 Second, the sequential nature of both forward and backward passes makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to parallelize the computation, which dramatically increases the time complexity in both training and testing procedure.
 These data sources are set or graph-like in nature and therefore the natural representation is unordered, posing a significant challenge for many machine-learning techniques.
 ”Use it or lose it” is frequently used to describe the environmental influence of the learning process on synaptic pruning, however there is little scientific consensus on what exactly is lost (Casey et al., 2000).
 By solving the sub-goals, low-level actions are composed into high-level temporal abstractions.
 In practice, this implies that many optimization algorithms rely on several different kinds of hand-designed heuristics.
 However model-based algorithms pose strong requirements about the models used.
 Furthermore, auto-regressive models such as Pixel Recurrent Neural Networks (PixelRNNs) (Van Den Oord et al., 2016) model the conditional distribution of every individual pixel given previous pixels.
Despite the huge promise of GAIL, it has not yet had the same impact as GANs; in particular, robust GAIL from pixels for control applications remains a challenge.
The Bin Packing Problem (BPP) is one of the classic integer combinatorial optimization problems and it has been extensively studied for decades (Wu et al., 2010).
 This problem is termed as unseen attribute-object pair recognition.
There has been substantial work on understanding attention in neural network models.
 Madry et al., (2017) formalize the adversarial learning against this class of perturbations as a minimization problem of adversarial risk defined in a following way.
 The developed ensemble techniques have shown consistent benefits in real-world machine learning applications, evidenced by the Netflix Competition (Bennett et al., 2007) and Kaggle competition.
 One can model the task of hyper-parameter search as optimizing an unknown/black box function as (1).
 Specifically, which part contributes the most to the similarity is a straightforward question and the answer can reveal important hidden information about the model as well as the data.
 Indeed, each bond in the target molecule may represent a possible retrosynthetic disconnection, leading to a vast space of possible starting materials.
 In e-commerce and on streaming platforms, companies with subscription services like Amazon and Netflix may be interested in predicting when users might cancel their subscriptions.
 We propose an automatic technique to mitigate bias in language generation models based on the use of an external memory in which word embeddings are associated to gender information, and they can be sparsely updated based on content-based lookup.
 Individual object “parts” need to be carefully and consistently annotated with pixel-level precision.
Actionable estimates of predictive uncertainty are ones that (1) cover the true prediction target with high probability, and (2) discriminate between high- and low-confidence predictions.
 In the modern deep learning era, sequential memory architectures such as recurrent neural networks are used for sequential inference (e.g, language generation (Sutskever et al., (2014))) to narrow down the search space.
S1 is a positive example since it describes a hotel with good staff.
Bloom filter ensures a zero false negative rate (FNR), which is a critical requirement for many applications.
 Differentially private training of neural networks ensures that the model does not unduly disclose any sensitive information.
 In drug discovery, GNNs have been very successful across several molecular graph classification and generation tasks.
 Existing literatures have shows that variants of GAN achieved impressive results in both a supervised and unsupervised setting.
 Our focus in this paper is on test-time attacks in which an adversary generates a slightly perturbed sample to fool a classifier or an object-detector.
 Many recent RL successes have been obtained by relying on well-formed reward signals, that provide rich gradient information to guide policy learning.
Starting from Shannon’s seminal work that essentially introduced statistical language modeling (Shannon, 1951), the most classical and widely studied long-term property of a language model is its entropy rate — the average amount of information contained per word, conditioned on the preceding words.
 Thus, an important issue is to select representatives from sets for efficient group understanding.
 In white-box approach, architectural modification of the classification model (Bach et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2017; Mahendran & Vedaldi, 2016; Selvaraju et al., 2017; Simonyan et al., 2013; Springenberg et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2016; Zeiler & Fergus, 2013) or access to specific layers (Bach et al., 2015; Selvaraju et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2016) is inevitable (Petsiuk et al., 2018), resulting in severe limitation of application.
 The estimation of Qπ(s, a) or V π(s) typically involves a discounted sum of future rewards, which still suffers from the high variance especially when facing the long time horizon.
 This work investigates and alleviates the inhibited channels emerged in the “Norm+ReLU-like” building block, which consists of a normalization layer and a ReLU-like activation function given byyncij = g(x̃ncij), x̃ncij = γcx̄ncij + βc, (1)where subscript n, c, i, and j denote indices of a sample, a channel, height and width of a feature channel respectively.
 In this paper, we propose a new inference algorithm for fitting switching nonlinear dynamical systems (SNLDS), which can be used to segment time series data as sequences of images, or lower dimensional signals, such as (x,y) locations into meaningful discrete temporal “modes” or “regimes”.
 In this case, human annotators may observe the label imperfectly due to differing degrees of expertise or measurement error, see e.g, medical examples such as labeling MRI images from patients.
 BEMs enable us to identify policies with their Probabilistic Policy Embeddings (PPEs), which we define as the pushforward distributions over trajectory embeddings as a result of applying a BEM to a policy’s trajectories.
 Identifying patient subgroups with similar progression patterns can be advantageous for understanding such heterogeneous underlying diseases.
 The largest publicly available language model to date is trained with 1.6 billion parameters (Keskar et al., 2019).
 Unfortunatelly, the memory requirements of dense, convolutional and recurrent layers grow quadratically with layer information bandwidth 1.
 The original GCN model, as well as its numerous variations, has shown great success in a variety of applications, including semisupervised node classification (Kipf & Welling, 2017), inductive node embedding (Hamilton et al., 2017), link prediction (van den Berg et al., 2017), and knowledge graphs (Schlichtkrull et al., 2018).
 In recent years, adaptive variants of SGD have emerged and shown their successes for their convenient automatic learning rate adjustment mechanism.
Specifically, we consider the ResNet with the following residual block,hl = φ(hl−1 + τW lhl−1), (1)where φ(·) is the ReLU activation, hl is the output of layer l, W l is the parameter of layer l and τ is a scale factor on the parametric branch in a residual block.
 Object tracking is found in a wide range of computer vision applications including autonomous vehicles, surveillance, and robotics.
 A large number of architectures are sampled and trained from scratch.
 The former group aims to inspect the structures and the parameters of a complex model (Erhan et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2016).
 Yet, while useful, none has elevated neural networks to be capable of learning from and processing data on size and time scales commensurate with traditional computing systems.
By modeling the sparse prior in natural images, the Sparse Coding (SC) based methods for SR (Yang et al., 2008; 2010; 2014) with strong theoretical support are widely used owing to their excellent performance.
 Researchers have been actively working on understanding the cause of adversarial examples (Szegedy et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015) and approaches for improving model robustness against them (Madry et al., 2018; Tramèr et al., 2018; Liao et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018).
 Freitas et al., (2012) proposed a method that uses Bayesian optimization with dividing region, which successfully accelerates convergence rate.
 Since one has access to the full microscopic state at each step, it is possible to test hypotheses and make measurements that would otherwise be impossible.
 Examples include variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014), reversible generative models (Dinh et al., 2014; 2017; Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018), and Wasserstein autoencoders (WAEs) (Tolstikhin et al., 2018).
 These efforts can be roughly categorized into four major classes: network pruning (Han et al., (2015); Anwar et al., (2015); Peng et al., (2019); Zhuang et al., (2018)), low rank approximation (Tai et al., (2015); Wang et al., (2018); Hayashi et al., (2019)), knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., (2015); Zagoruyko & Komodakis (2016)), and network quantization (Courbariaux & Bengio (2016); Lin et al., (2015); Wu et al., (2015); Polino et al., (2018); Zhang et al., (2018)).
 It has also been demonstrated that different classifiers can be attacked by the same adversarial perturbation (Szegedy et al., 2013).
 Due to the rise of GNNs in machine learning applications, understanding GNNs theoretically has gathered lots of attention in the machine learning community.
Models based on the notion of recurrence have enjoyed pervasive impact across many applications.
Researchers have therefore started investigating formal verification techniques for DNNs.
 For example, tasks such as image inpainting, super-resolution, or text-to-image synthesis have been successfully addressed within the framework of conditional generation, with conditional GANs (cGANs) among the most competitive approaches.
 Specifically, MobileNet (Howard et al., 2017) factorizes a standard 3\\u00d73 convolution into a 3\\u00d73 depth-wise convolution and a 1\\u00d71 point-wise convolution.
 Using these idealized equations, a completely physics-driven approach would have large errors on real-world data.
We introduce a generative model for audio which captures longer-range dependencies than existing end-to-end models.
 Human participation can potentially help DRL algorithms by accelerating their training and reducing the learning costs without compromising final performance.
 For example, in biological problems where a graph represents the chemical structure (Gilmer et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2018) of a certain drug assembled through atoms, it is not easy to obtain a detailed analysis of the function for each atom since getting expert labeling advice is very expensive.
In these critical applications, it is desirable to impose some fairness criteria.
 For example, expensive ensemble and deep neural network (DNN) teachers have been used to train inexpensive decision tree (Craven & Shavlik, 1996; Frosst & Hinton, 2017) and shallow neural network (Bucila et al., 2006; Li et al., 2014; Ba & Caruana, 2014; Hinton et al., 2015; Urban et al., 2017) students.
 The discriminative model and generative model are mutually related (Lasserre et al., 2006; Minka, 2005).
 Accurate spatiotemporal forecasting methods may not only lower the barrier for decision making, but also improve the quality of various services including traffic management, transportation, and air quality management.
 They are commonly based on the concept of Granger causality (Granger, 1969; 1980) to investigate the causal relationship with quantification measures.
 VAE samples therefore tend to be blurry and exhibit little meaningful variation around the predicted mean.
 We are interested in enabling such compositionality capabilities in machine learning systems, particularly in the generative modeling context.
 For this reason, in this work we focus on unsupervised methods for outlier detection (1).
 These issues have amplified the need for making these black-box models interpretable.
 However, it is harder to infer the decision process for more complicated tasks such as VQA.
 The perturbation is almost imperceptible to humans but can fool the model to make a wrong prediction.
Humans are efficient learners with the ability to quickly understand and process diverse ideas.
Our goal is to train policies that can be controlled, or calibrated, to produce different behavioral styles inherent in the demonstration data.
 DML has been widely used in many tasks such as face recognition (Fan et al., (2017)), image retrieval (Chen & Deng (2019)), and classification (Qian et al., (2015); Li et al., (2019)).
 Complete data in this case can be either labeled data (for classification), or time-series data with no missing values (for regression), or simply image with no missing pixels (for generation).
 So far, this fact has been a major obstacle for the deployment of deep neural models in applications constrained by memory, computational, and energy resources, such as those running on embedded systems.
 However, long-term video prediction remains an open problem due to high complexity of the video contents.
Structured sparsity has been explored for RNNs and also CNNs where a certain number of nonzeros is allowed across various cross-sections of the weight tensors.
 In classification tasks, feature maps are typically downsampled to achieve spatial invariance by reducing the spatial dimensions of the representation while learning higher-level abstractions.
 This process is called domain adaptation, which transfers knowledge from a label rich source domain to a label scarce target domain (Pan & Yang, 2009).
 For instance, Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., (2019) investigates regularizing the curvature of the loss surface to increase the adversarial robustness of trained models.
 Such the tasks are very common in various scientific fields (Ntampaka et al., 2016; Ravanbakhsh et al., 2016; Faber et al., 2016), hence, numerous deep neural networks have been developed to handle such the data with invariance (Zaheer et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018a; Su et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018b; Yang et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018).
As a motivating example, we may be restricted to measuring the expression levels of only a small number of genes, and then use these measurements in a variety of future prediction tasks, such as disease subtype prediction, cell type classification, and so on.
 Previous studies have demonstrated three well-known facts about the word embedding: (1) Levy & Goldberg (2014b) showes many different kinds of word embeddings (e.g, SGNS) can be understood as the matrix factorization framework.
Concern about over-parameterizing models has weakened, however, as many recent studies have found that adding parameters can actually reduce a DNN’s generalization-gap (the drop in performance when moving from previously seen to previously unseen inputs), even though it has been shown that the same networks have enough parameters to fit large datasets of randomized data (Neyshabur et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016).
 The original VAE used factorized Gaussian for both the prior and the variational posterior (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014).
 A common way to construct invertible networks is to use triangular coupling layers (Dinh et al., 2014; 2017; Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018), where dimension partitioning is interleaved with ResNet-type computation.
 This casts an urgent demand for developing robust classifiers with provable worst case guarantees.
 Like Papernot & McDaniel (2018), we apply k-NN on the learned intermediate representation of a preliminary model, which adds robustness.
The question of fairness has a long history (Sen & McMurrin, 1980) and its definition continues to be debated (Dwork et al., 2012; Chouldechova, 2016; Joseph et al., 2016).
We propose a method to 1) learn and 2) use an environment decomposition in the form of a world graph, a task-agnostic abstraction.
 Yet, possibly the most widely used models, deep neural networks (LeCun et al., 2015), are unable to accurately quantify model uncertainty.
The majority of studies have predominantly depended on edges to aggregate the neighboring nodes’ features.
In order to address these issues, several interpretation approaches have been proposed in the last few years.
However, state-of-the-art CNNs are challenged by their robustness, especially vulnerability to adversarial attacks based on small, human-imperceptible modifications of the input (Szegedy et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015).
 This presents a challenge for theories of Deep Learning based on Shannon Information (Saxe et al., 2018).
 Various modifications have been proposed to improve convergence or approximation error (Gordon, 1995; 1999; Szepesvári & Smart, 2004; Melo & Ribeiro, 2007; Maei et al., 2010; Munos et al., 2016); but it remains difficult to reliably attain both robustness and scalability.
 As a result, their transformation power is largely reduced for tasks that are unsupervised in nature, such as anomaly detection and clustering.
 Studies demonstrated that early treatment has a significant positive effect on the survival rate (Kumar et al., 2006; Nguyen et al., 2007).
 Most of these attack methods are based on maximizing a loss function with a gradient-based optimizer, where the gradient is either computed by back-propagation (in the white-box setting) or finite-difference estimation (in the soft-label blackbox setting).
 Besides, due to the vast learning capacity of deep networks, they will eventually over-fit on these noisy labels, leading to poor predicting performance, which can be worse than that obtained from simple models (Zhang et al., 2016; Arpit et al., 2017).
 This formulation is sufficient for problems where spatial situatedness of a scene, which embodies knowledge of semantic likeness between neighborhoods in the geophysical world, is not important.
However, if we wish to deploy these RL agents into security-critical applications, we must take their reliability into consideration.
 Generative adverserial network (GAN) Goodfellow et al., (2014) provides a framework to directly draw new samples without estimating data distribution.
 However, right after it takes the left turn (say), it again does not need the goal information when choosing actions and can follow ‘default’ or ‘option-independent’ behaviour.
 This follows from the design of DNN classifiers that are optimized over in-distribution data without the knowledge of OOD data.
 Firstly, humans and animals tend to imitate the goal of the task rather than the particular motions of the demonstrator (Baker et al., 2007).
One reason for the low data-efficiency is the long temporal horizon the reward signal has to propagate through.
 At meta-train time, these algorithms assume access to a meta-dataset of datasets from individual tasks, and at meta-test time, the learner is evaluated on a single task.
 This lack of statistical efficiency makes it difficult to apply RL to real-world tasks, as the cost of acting in the real world is far greater than in a simulator.
 For models to be useful in the real world, they need to be both accurate on a high-quality held-out set of images, which we refer to as \\u201cclean accuracy,\\u201d and robust on corrupted images, which we refer to as \\u201crobustness.
The field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has also recently seen a surge in the popularity of maximum entropy RL algorithms.
 For example, the original lottery ticket hypothesis argued that these winning tickets emerge from the network initialization.
 To be formal, let x be a data point in the dx-dimensional observable space Rdx and y be its corresponding low-dimensional representation in the feature space Rdy .
 On the other hand, complex-valued representations are better suited to certain types of data, particularly those that are naturally expressed in the frequency domain.
 Compression techniques have been applied to many networks, reducing memory requirements and improving their performance.
 While each of these proposed models has pushed the state of the art on respective benchmarks, their architectures are diverse and the learned representations are highly task-specific, preventing them from being generalized to other tasks.
 In order to get a smaller estimation error, `0-norm constrained algorithms are more prominent than `1-norm convex relaxation algorithms (Zhang et al., 2010).
 Consider agent Alice and Bob in Minecraft.
 Unfortunately, finding an analytical solution in closed form is in many cases very difficult, if not impossible.
 The FL system proposed by Google (Bonawitz et al., 2019) selects a sample of available devices and sends them a model to be trained.
 These studies are mainly divided into two groups depending on the scaling factor of the output of the networks to which the global convergence property has been demonstrated using different types of proofs.
In order to further understand the training behavior of GANs, there has been a surge of interest in min-max optimization or games.
 Unfortunately, independent MARL fails to converge to a Nash equilibrium in many settings (Bowling, 2000; Shoham et al., 2003).
In this paper we propose a novel neural architecture, TP-N2F, to solve natural- to formal-language generation tasks (N2F).
 One reason is the architecture and parameters’ number of LM itself (Radford et al., 2019; Santoro et al., 2018).
 There is an increasing interest in relationship zero-shot learning (ZSL) that learns to recognize the unseen relationship triplets, where the studies (Lu et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2017) on this ZSL problem setting assume the components (subject, predicate, and object) of the relationship triplet are seen.
 As a mutual information, the predictive information gives us a reparameterization independent, symmetric, interpretable measure of the co-dependence of two random variables.
 While this area of research has exploded in the past few years, the vast body of work has been done on the generation of new molecular compounds, i.g,the search for new molecular graphs, based on string encodings of that graph structure or other representations (Gómez-Bombarelli et al., 2018; Winter et al., 2019b).
 A conformation x of a molecule is defined by a set of atoms {( i, ri)}Nvi=1, where Nv is the number of atoms in the molecule, i ∈ {H,C,O, …} is the chemical element of the atom i, and ri ∈ R3 is its position in Cartesian coordinates.
 Such a situation can also occur in disease diagnosis in multi-modal medical imaging where one of the modalities fails or is not available; for example the positron emission tomography (PET) modality which reveals metabolic information for clinical tests requires ingesting a radioactive tracer which poses health risks and is often missing (Cai et al., 2018).
 To bridge this gap, there has been a recent resurgence of interest in few-shot learning that aims to learn novel concepts from very few labeled examples (Fei-Fei et al., 2006; Vinyals et al., 2016; Wang & Hebert, 2016; Snell et al., 2017; Finn et al., 2017).
An important fact about these works is that they focus on discriminative classifiers, which directly model the conditional probabilities of labels given samples.
 To alleviate this issue, there have been huge efforts in designing fast heuristic solvers (Biere et al., 2009; Knuth, 1997; Mezard et al., 2009) that generate approximate solutions for such scenarios.
 In contrast, humans only require few examples to be able to rapidly adapt to a novel task; humans are still better learners.
 While vanilla Long Short-term Memories (LSTMs) have modest abilities to exploit spatial features (Shi et al., 2015), convolution-based recurrent neural network (RNN) models, such as ConvLSTM (Shi et al., 2015) and PredRNN++ (Wang et al., 2018), are limited to modeling grid-structural data, and are therefore inappropriate for handling scattered point-clouds.
 However, despite growing insights into the dynamics of GAN training, most recent advances in large-scale image generation come from architectural improvements (Radford et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019), or regularisation focusing on particular parts of the model (Miyato et al., 2018; Miyato & Koyama, 2018).
 This objective has been formalized as maximizing the entropy of the learned policy\\u2019s visited state distribution 1 H(S) (Hazan et al., 2018a), since a policy that maximizes this objective should approach a uniform distribution over valid states.
Many models fφ : X → Z trying to learn such representations have been proposed (Dinh et al., 2016; Hinton et al., 2006; Maddison et al., 2017; Radford et al., 2015), but recently in order to solve this problem it was proposed to consider a dual problem: define a priori z and find a generator map gθ, such that for any z, gθ(z) is an element of X .
 Many different approaches have been proposed for architecture optimization, including random search, evolutionary algorithms, Bayesian optimization and an approach based on a NN trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL).
Han et al., (2016) reduced the memory requirement for devices by pruning and quantizing weight coefficients after training the models.
 Hence, our desire is to build a model that learns not only the multi-manifold structure but also the correlations between the manifolds.
 The goal is to train a classifier on the support set and to classify the query set with maximum accuracy.
 In many scenarios, these tasks can be cast as sequence prediction problems.
 The explainability problem is significantly exacerbated when more complex models are used.
 Indeed, learned representations turn out to be quite versatile—in computer vision, for example, they are the driving force behind transfer learning Girshick et al., (2014); Donahue et al., (2014), and image similarity metrics such as VGG distance Dosovitskiy & Brox (2016a); Johnson et al., (2016); Zhang et al., (2018).
Generally, the magnitude of search space for NAS tasks is enormous.
The agent’s own past good trajectories with high total rewards are easily accessible (though imperfect) alternatives for the human-expert demonstrations.
 GCNs have inspired the current state-of-the art models for graph-based SSL Wu et al., (2019a); Veličković et al., (2018); Vashishth et al., (2019).
 While early areas of the ventral stream (V1-V2) are strongly affected by variation in e.g, object size, position or illumination, later levels of processing are increasingly robust to such changes, as measured first in single neurons of the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of macaques Booth & Rolls (1998) and then in humans’ (Quiroga et al., 2005; Isik et al., 2013).
 By decomposing a complex problem into subproblems, HRL significantly reduces the difficulty of solving specific task.
 The sensory data collected is used to build a model that typically predicts future observations y>t from past actions a≤t and past observations y≤t.
Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) (Lopez-Paz & Ranzato, 2017) is a significant method for continual learning.
 This is a fixed kernel that inherits some benefits of CNNs, including exploitation of locality via convolution, as well as multiple layers of processing.
 On one hand, in order to solve the primary objective better, it is necessary to optimize the additional objectives simultaneously.
 Notably, the differentially private stochastic gradient descent, or DP-SGD, of Abadi et al., (2016) is an easyto-use, generally-applicable modification of stochastic gradient descent.
 Such techniques include quantization where every operation is quantized in lowprecision during training such a (Zhou et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018), or, use fixed-point integers instead of floating-point numbers (Wu et al., 2018; Das et al., 2018).
In particular, quantization works usually focus on scalar quantization of the feature maps: mapping the activation values to a discrete set {qi} of size L.
 However, considering the costs of collecting data, companies may not be willing to release the dataset if possible.
 The issue with sample complexity can be mitigated by learning from expert behavior.
 Various methods such as pruning (He et al., 2017), light-weights (Howard et al., 2017), and quantization (Courbariaux et al., 2015) have been carried out to reduce the model size and/or computation complexity effectively.
 The privacy risks due to membership inference elevate when the DNNs are trained on sensitive data such as in healthcare applications.
 It targets a large class of problems where the sequence of stochastic processes is governed by underlying transition dynamics and where learning to transfer information between stochastic processes is useful.
 The key idea is to encourage the network to give consistent predictions for unlabeled inputs that are perturbed in various ways.
 Many deep learningmodels can also be formulated as (1).
 Despite providing valuable insights, these approaches are by construction blind to key structural properties of real-world data sets.
 Some papers claim SGD with Momentum significantly outperforms SGD without Momentum (Sutskever et al., 2013), but others observe little difference between both algorithms in practice (Kidambi et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019).
 Such systems solve the problem of reliably transmitting information from sender to receiver given some form of information loss due to transmission errors (i.g, through a noisy channel).
 The idea of learning using a curriculum of problems is also widely used in machine learning (Bengio et al., 2009; Elman, 1993; Resnick et al., 2018; Salimans & Chen, 2018) and in this work we apply curriculum learning to automatic theorem proving focusing on arithmetic.
 Recent studies (Guimaraes et al., 2017; De Cao & Kipf, 2018; Xue & van Hoeve, 2019) observed that GANs struggle in these tasks.
 This leads to the generation of high quality samples (Adler & Lunz, 2018; Brock et al., 2019).
 The lack of robustness of DNNs to such out-of-distribution (OoD) inputs (or outliers/anomalies) was recently addressed by the development of various methods to detect OoD inputs.
 These applications are of more local decisions for which a learning algorithm can usually make inferences by inspecting the local structure of a graph.
 Many early efforts to train more robust models initially appeared promising, but have since been shown to be vulnerable to new algorithms for constructing adversarial perturbations (Xu et al., 2019; Athalye et al., 2018).
 For instance, in Genome wide association studies (GWAS), feature selection can help identify such models and lead to improved risk assessment and reduced cost.
 As a result, there has been large interest in learning sparse representations of these discrete objects rather than the full embedding matrix for cheaper storage as well as faster training and inference.
Apart from its widespread empirical success in numerous applications, the convergence of Qlearning and temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms has also been extensively studied in the literature (Jaakkola et al., 1994; Baird, 1995; Tsitsiklis & Van Roy, 1997; Perkins & Pendrith, 2002; Melo et al., 2008; Mehta & Meyn, 2009; Liu et al., 2015; Bhandari et al., 2018; Lakshminarayanan & Szepesvari, 2018; Zou et al., 2019b).
 (1)Computing the exact posterior distribution over θ is computationally expensive (if not impossible) when p(yn|xn,θ) is a deep neural network.
 DRL’s model-free, Monte-Carlo-style methods have made it applicable to a wide range of physical (and non-physical) simulation environments, including those where a smooth, well-behaved dynamical model does not exist.
 Although deep convolutional encoders can learn good representations (upon which a policy can be trained), they require large amounts of training data.
 To make it further worse, it has been shown that a single noise, called universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), can be added to any image and fool the network.
On this wise, the federated learning takes a simple approach that performs iterative parameter averaging of local updates computed from each learners’ own dataset, which suggests an efficient way to learn a shared model without centralizing training data from multiple sources; but hereby, since the local data of each device is created based on their usage pattern, the heterogeneity of training data distributions across the learners might be naturally assumed in real-world cases.
 Mysteriously however neural network models trained via simple algorithms such as (stochastic) gradient descent continue to predict well or generalize on yet unseen test data.
 In the text generation setting, they are also faced with the additional obstacle of passing discrete tokens through a non-differentiable operation, which prohibits back-propagating the gradient signal to the generator.
 Again, only the winning entry gets the prize, but other participants incur the cost of their effort.
 Obtaining such annotations usually requires a great amount of manual work and is therefore expensive.
 This allowed DeepXML to be applied to the problem of matching millions of advertiser bid phrases to a user’s query on a popular web search engine where it was found to increase prediction accuracy by more than 19 percentage points as compared to the leading techniques currently in production.
 Many applications of the seq2seq framework require the decoder to copy some words in the input.
 Many authors have tried to understand the role batch normalization plays during training (Balduzzi et al., 2017; Santurkar et al., 2018; Bjorck et al., 2018; Sankararaman et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Ghorbani et al., 2019), to replace batch normalization with cheaper alternatives (Ba et al., 2016; Salimans & Kingma, 2016; Ulyanov et al., 2016), or to remove normalization entirely (Mishkin & Matas, 2015; Krähenbühl et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019).
 The CPD problem has been widely researched during the last three decades (4; 18; 13; 6; 16; 9) and it has been applied to several fields such as financial market analysis, medicine, climate science as well as system monitoring.
 It is still an open problem in the field to figure out how to take advantage of large unlabeled datasets, use them for learning rich representations and improving the data-efficiency of supervised learning systems.
 Image-level OOD detection outputs a classification for the entire image; this coarse level of detection may be inadequate for many safety critical applications, including autonomous driving.
 The exact explanation of an anomalous data point depends on the specific domain of focus.
In this paper, we propose a method to train a policy which efficiently explores a continuous state space.
 At each time step t, the signal st can be independently reconstructed using the measurements xt by solving (Donoho, 2006):min ht {1 2 ‖xt −ADht‖22 + λ‖ht‖1 } , (1)where ‖ · ‖p is the `p-norm and λ is a regularization parameter.
 How can recognition harness structure without restraining the representation?Free-form representations are structure-agnostic, making them general, but not exploiting structure is computationally and statistically inefficient.
 At the same time, evidence is being accumulated that, when training powerful deep models, the difference in performance between acquisition strategies is small (Gissin & Shalev-Shwartz, 2018; Chitta et al., 2019; Beluch et al., 2018).
 First, some works (Farrús Cabeceran et al., 2010; Popović & Ney, 2011; Lommel et al., 2014) have attempted to shift the granularity of evaluation from holistic to fine-grained by conducting error analysis.
 On the other hand, the expansion of the metro network in turn has a profound impact on the city.
 Recently, VC has gained more attention due to its fascinating real-world applications in privacy and identity protection, military operations, generating new voices for animated and fictional movies, voice repair in medical-domain, voice assistants, etc.
 Preconditioned methods (Nemirovsky & Yudin (1983); Lu et al., (2016); Maddison et al., (2019)) are powerful optimization algorithms that converges linearly under weaker assumptions that gradient descent.
Previous research on embeddings has focused on cases where each example is associated with just one class (e.g, the image contains only one person’s face).
 In recent years, this difficulty led to great interest in zero-shot learning (ZSL) (Farhadi et al., 2009; Frome et al., 2013; Lampert et al., 2014; Xian et al., 2018a), which is training by a labeled set from certain classes called seen classes and then predicting completely unseen classes that are not included in the training set.
 These engender representations which maintain algorithm performance but significantly improve latency, throughput and power consumption of hardware implementations.
Unfortunately, hardware trends point to an increasing divide between compute and networking or storage bandwidth (Li et al., 2016; Lim et al., 2019; Kurth et al., 2018).
 Under this assumption, the matrix completion problem can be cast via the least-squares variant,min Xrank (X) + µ2 ‖(X −M) S‖2F .
 Such errors can propagate through network and degrade the classification accuracy (Nazaré et al., (2017); Luo & Yang (2014)).
In particular, the DeepSets model (Zaheer et al., 2017) computes a representation of each element of the set, then combines the representations using a commutative function (e.g, addition) to form a representation of the set that discards ordering information.
 Come test day, student A is only able to answer test questions that are very similar to the class material while student B has no trouble answering different looking questions that follow the same reasoning.
 However, as our experiments on synthetic data show, when the tasks are unrelated, parameter sharing may actually hurt individual tasks performance.
 Although such models do not provide detailed explanations of V1 at the level of neuronal dynamics, they help us understand the computational problems being solved by V1.
 Hertzmann (1998); Winkenbach & Salesin (1996) generate compelling results using stroke-based rendering.
 Therefore, AD problems are usually formulated as one-class classification (OCC) problems (Moya et al., 1993), where either only a few or no anomalous data samples are available for training the model (Khan & Madden, 2014).
 Such problems are particularly prevalent in healthcare tasks, which often involve limited quantities of labeled data captured at a high temporal resolution (e.g, electrocardiogram waveforms).
In a classification context, e.g, when the goal is to distinguish between positive and negative sentiments in user reviews, most classifiers are based on Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) strategies and variants of it.
 For evenly spaced sequences, historically popular models have included hidden Markov models and discrete-time linear dynamical systems, with more recent interest in recurrent neural network models such as LSTMs.
 For these reasons, investigation of techniques to certify more complex specifications has started to take place (Liu et al., 2019; Dvijotham et al., 2018a; Singh et al., 2019).
Implementations of SGD on distributed systems and data-parallel versions of SGD are scalable and take advantage of multi-GPU systems.
 In particular, in the infinite width (or channel) limit, the distribution of functions induced by neural networks with random weights and biases has been precisely characterized before, during, and after training.
 Word2Vec, for example, extracts meaning from the learned location of words in a vector space (Mikolov et al., 2013a;b).
 Therefore, it is important to study alternative solutions to this problem.
 This is especially important when such models become part of security and safety related solutions (Amodei et al., 2016b).
 Several convolution architectures (Xu et al., 2019b; Morris et al., 2019) are connected to the Weisfeiler–Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test because of the resemblance in iterative node (re)labeling.
 Such distraction hinders the understanding process, which calls for an effective attention.
 Some results take a classical approximation theory approach, focusing on the relationship between the architecture of the network and the classes of functions it can accurately approximate (Lu et al., (2017); Cybenko (1992); Hornik et al., (1989)).
 For example, in image denoising, we aim to remove noise in the signal that is not useful to an observer and restore the image to its original \\u201cclean\\u201d form.
 Recovering missing satellite data is an active research topic.
 A popular solution is to distill an ensemble of models into a single compact network by attempting to match the average predictions of the original ensemble.
 However, MLE models have been arguably suffered from exposure bias (Bengio et al., 2015; Ranzato et al., 2016) which means a discrepancy between training and inference stages due to the fact that at inference time, the model predicts next token based on the sequence generated by itself which may not occur in training set.
 The interplay of model-based and model-free approaches in RL has received a lot of research attention.
 Most existing work focused on constructing adversarial examples by adding Lp bounded pixel-wise perturbations (Goodfellow et al., 2014b) or spatially transforming the image (Xiao et al., 2018c; Engstrom et al., 2017) (e.g, in-plane rotation or out-of-plane rotation).
 VI is biased but offers a computationally efficient generation of approximate samples.
 In this case, the image corresponds to a high bandwidth channel and the word ‘cat’ to a low bandwidth channel.
 Note that GNNs adopt the concept of the convolution operation into graph domain.
 That is, most perturbation-based attribution methods implement the absence of an input feature by replacing it with (a) mean pixels; (b) random noise; or (c) blurred versions of the original content.
 Recently, there have been a surge in popularity on few-shot learning methods (Vinyals et al., 2016; Koch et al., 2015; Gidaris & Komodakis, 2018).
 Surprisingly, in contrast to physical matter where molecules often reuse quasi-identical atoms (i.g, repeating carbon, hydrogen, etc.), neural networks do not share the same neurons across layers.
 More specifically, waking the owner is an example of what we call self-induced distributional shift (SIDS), as it changes the distribution of inputs to the robot’s coffee prediction algorithm.
 This is particularly common in web applications, which may involve high-cardinality categorical features such as user IDs, item IDs, and ZipCodes, etc.
 Although simple heuristics such as -greedy (Mnih et al., 2013), entropy regularization (Mnih et al., 2016a), and noisy network (Fortunato, 2018) were proposed, they are still far from satisfactory in such environments.
 The main objective of the task is to identify the video segment within a longer video that is most relevant to a sentence.
 An alternative hypothesis has proposed that intelligent systems need not be structured a priori, but can instead learn about the structure of the world in an unsupervised manner (Barlow, 1989; Hinton et al., 1999; LeCun et al., 2015).
 By simulating a chemical system at different interatomic distances, it is possible to determine a stable configuration where the atomic interaction is at an equilibrium (minimum potential energy).
 Our approach draws inspiration from imitating human experts, who can near-optimally accomplish given tasks.
 Relations are typically represented as a mapping from the embedding of a subject entity to its related object entity embedding(s).
 Collecting unlabeled data and the subsequent annotating process are both expensive and time-consuming.
 As a consequence, discount parameter or bound has to be tuned to ensure safety (Garcıa & Fernández, 2015).
 As a consequence, the computational requirements for training Deep Learning models have been growing at an exponential rate (Amodei & Hernandez) over the past few years, outperforming Moore’s Law and hardware capabilities by a wide margin.
 Moreover, black-box optimization techniques like ES do not require propagation of gradients, are tolerant to long time horizons, and do not suffer from sparse reward distributions (4).
Beyond informing our understanding of deep learning, going from function to parameters could have serious implications for security and privacy.
 These demonstrations are consequently distilled into a robot control policy by learning appropriate parameter settings of the controller.
Particularly, the objective of SR is to find a concise representation of a signal using a few atoms from some specified (over-complete) dictionaryy = Ax + (1)with y ∈ RM the observed measurements corrupted by some noises , x ∈ RN the sparse representation with no more than S nonzero entries (S-sparsity) and A ∈ RM×N the dictionary (normally M N ).
 Many real-world applications naturally admit network-structured data like social networks or graph-structured data like chemical compounds.
 These are inherent challenges in the domain adaptation problem as in real world it is common for the data to contain such class bias, noise and unlabeled data.
Ideally, when deploying an automated speech recognition system we would like to guarantee that the system is robust against noise injected by an adversary.
In this work we focus on certifying a neural network against a wider class of perturbations, by generalizing a recently presented statistical technique (Lecuyer et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2019), called smoothing, for creating classifiers that are provably robust against certain norm-based attacks.
 This allows computer systems to make better decisions by combining uncertainty with prediction.
 The permutation symmetries give rise to a loss landscape where any given global minimum in the weight space must have (n!)d−1 − 1 completely equivalent partner minima.
One way to compress these heavy models is knowledge transfer (KT).
 Consequently, there has been a surge in methods that find adversarial perturbations (Sabour et al., 2015; Papernot et al., 2016; Kurakin et al., 2016; Moosavi Dezfooli et al., 2016; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2017; Madry et al., 2017; Athalye et al., 2018).
Along with the afore-described empirical successes, there have been theoretical studies of the statistical properties of GANs—see e.g, (Zhang et al., 2018; Arora et al., 2017; 2018; Bai et al., 2018; Dumoulin et al., 2016) and their references.
 However, no prior work in topic modeling has employed topical embeddings (obtained from large document collection(s)), complementary to word embeddings.
 Major tasks in computer vision, e.g, image classification (He et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017), object detection (Ren et al., 2015; Redmon et al., 2016), all use L2 regularization as a default option.
While DCNNs show outstanding results for semantic and panoptic segmentation, they have two conceptional problems.
To handle the forgetting problem in deep learning, some studies suggested weight regularization (WR) techniques such as EWC (Kirkpatrick et al., (2017)), SI (Zenke et al., (2017)), and IMM (Lee et al., (2017)).
By observing the human intelligence that can explore their surroundings and learn valuable skills without reward, a couple of prior works have been recently proposed to generate skills without supervision by incorporating intrinsic motivation into DRL methods (Barto (2013),Ryan & Deci (2000)).
The first question faced in the daunting task of teaching computers to program is, how should one represent programming problems to teach computers? The ideal representation may be different from what suits humans.
 Thus, approaches such as Particle Image Velocimetry or Doppler flow measurements directly measure fluid quantities in real-world settings.
 ReLU-like activation functions are widely proved to be superior in terms of accuracy and convergence speed.
However, along with the significant performance enhancement, the parameter volume and complexity of these pre-trained language representations significantly increase.
 First, it should focus on objects (and their relations) which are foundational entities constructing the physical world.
 To maintain a good scalability, a low latency and high bandwidth network is essential for most modern distributed systems.
 Low-latency decoding is desirable for applications such as online speech recognition, and as-you-type machine translation.
 In practice, both players are parameterized by neural networks that are trained simultaneously by a variant of stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
 To answer these questions, we seek to understand across-layer and single-layer behavior.
 Small errors in the input and model can lead to dramatically different object trajectories.
Since the connectivity patterns and node contents of an attributed graph usually contain different information, it often requires joint modelling both aspects of information to achieve good learning performance.
 Some researchers directly answer the trustability (Ribeiro et al., 2016) or the fairness of a model (Zhao et al., 2017), while some other researchers seek to actually improve the model\\u2019s performance by understanding the model\\u2019s weak points (Koh & Liang, 2017).
 GANs do not need to make assumptions on the data formation other than applying a neural network on a latent noise input.
 That is, when trained e.g, on CIFAR-10, the models consistently assign higher likelihoods to the elements of the SVHN test set than for the elements of the CIFAR-10 test set or even the elements of the CIFAR-10 train set.
McCloskey & Cohen (1989) suggested the underlying cause of forgetting to be the distributed shared representation of tasks via network weights.
 The well-established equations of population genetics governing evolution under recombination (Bürger, 2000; Chastain et al., 2014) describe the way whereby the distribution of genotypes in the population is updated from one generation to the next, informed by the empirical fitness of the phenotypes during lifetime; and these equations do bear a similarity to gradient descent and, even closer, to no-regret learning (Chastain et al., 2014).
 For example, consider the sentences: Neural networks are interesting. I study neural networks. Maple syrup is delicious. John loves maple syrup.
 In order to understand neural network training, a line of work (Soudry et al., 2017; Gunasekar et al., 2018b;a) has made efforts in the perspective of “implicit bias”, which states that training algorithms for deep learning implicitly pose an inductive bias onto the training process and lead to a solution with low complexity measured by certain norms in the parameter space of the neural network.
 The mini-batch size is often independent of the training set size, which allows SGD to immediately adapt the model parameters before going through the entire training set.
 for which classical methods are not currently applicable, or would perform pathologically badly.
 Surprisingly, highly overparameterized deep networks—where the number of network parameters exceeds the number of training data points—can be trained for a range of different classification and regression tasks and perform extremely well on unobserved data.
 Otherwise, if the agent exploits rewards too intensely, it might converge to suboptimal behaviors and have fewer opportunities to discover more rewards from exploration.
 Later during cooking when you want to clean the table, you can select that sponge since you can relate its absorbing characteristics with another tool you have used for cleaning.
 This is the case, not only in experimental datasets, but also in datasets where properties are predicted computationally.
 As a result, node features are mapped into some Euclidian space.
 In this paper, we approach the problem by combining concepts from crowdsourcing, learning with noisy data and boosting to propose a novel framework: Boosting via Self Labelling (BSL).
 The high sample complexity restricts their applicability to real environments, where obtaining the required amount of interactions is prohibitively time-consuming.
So far, existing works on adversarial text generation either leverage heuristic solutions such as genetic algorithms (Jin et al., 2019) to search for potential adversarial sentences, or are limited to attacking specific NLP tasks (Cheng et al., 2018; Lei et al., 2018).
 Furthermore, precise uncertainty estimates are useful both for human interpretation of confidence and anomaly detection, and also for propagating these estimates to other autonomous components of a larger, connected system.
 Recently, proposed methods include the intrinsically motivated goal exploration process (IMGEP) (Forestier et al., 2017), and maximum state entropy exploration (MSEE) (Hazan et al., 2019).
 The encoder f in VAE parameterizes the variational posterior qf (z|x) in light of the lower bound of the marginal log-likelihoodlog pg(x) = log ∫ pg(x|z)p(z)dz = log ∫ qf (z|x) qf (z|x) pg(x|z)p(z)dz (1)≥ −DKLqf (z|x)||p(z) + Eqlog pg(x|z).
 However, this assumption is not always true in many real-world problems.
While uDA methods are indeed effective, little attention has been paid on how they would be incorporated in real-world machine learning systems.
While semantically invariant text transformations can remarkably alter a model’s predictions, the converse problem of model undersensitivity is equally troublesome: a model’s text input can often be drastically changed in meaning while retaining the original prediction.
 2) The NLP models trained on general corpora are not well-suited to supervised tasks since domain-specific texts have a specialized language with unique vocabulary and expressions.
 Understanding the relationship between these different levels of structure and the role that a protein plays is one of the grand challenges of biology.
 For instance, the sentence You can leave can be inferred from the sentence You don’t have to stay there.
 A common framework to tackle this problem is to consider a high-dimensional BO (HDBO) task as a standard BO problem in a low-dimensional embedding, where the embedding can be either linear (typically a random projection) or nonlinear (e.g, via a multi-layer neural network); see Sec. 2 for a full review.
 Recent advancements led to approximate implementations of these methods that prove efficient for practical scale applications (Ba et al., 2016; Grosse & Martens, 2016; Martens et al., 2018; Osawa et al., 2019).
 ICD coding is a multi-label text classification task with a long-tailed class label distribution.
 A classic framework states the interpolation issue as the miminisation of an energy, which may be interpreted in a Bayesian framework.
 A desirable property of a learning system is one that effectively applies knowledge gained from a few or many examples, while reducing the generalization gap when trained on little data and not being encumbered by its own learning routines when there are many examples.
Methods based on SGD iteratively update the parameters of the model by moving them in a scaled (negative) direction of the gradient calculated on a minibatch.
 Consequently, training DNNs with traditional learning procedures on noisy data strongly deteriorates their ability to generalize – a severe problem.
 Encouraged by the huge success of neural machine translation, these approaches formulate the QG task as a sequence-tosequence (Seq2Seq) learning problem.
The same benefits of extraction and exploitation of common features among the tasks achieved in MTL, can be obtained in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning (MTRL) when training a single agent on multiple Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems with common structures (Taylor & Stone, 2009; Lazaric, 2012).
 Nevertheless, despite increasing interest and strong results, little is known about what accounts for these performance gains, and the training dynamics involved.
 Recent work extends the global sum/average pooling operations to graph models by simply summing or averaging all node features (Atwood & Towsley, 2016; Simonovsky & Komodakis, 2017).
 A series of solvers haven been developed to solve graph matching problem (Leordeanu & Hebert, 2005; Cho et al., 2010; Bernard et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2018).
While there have been numerous previous works (Brandes et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2019) devoted to semi-supervised node classification based on explicit graph Laplacian regularizations, it is hard to efficiently boost the performance of label prediction due to the strict assumption that connected nodes are likely to share the same label information.
 As a result, compounding errors cause the agent to drift away from the demonstrated states (Ross et al., 2011).
 While the importance of deep learning on tabular data is recognized by the ML community, and many works address this problem (Zhou & Feng, 2017; Yang et al., 2018; Miller et al., 2017; Lay et al., 2018; Feng et al., 2018; Ke et al., 2018), the proposed DNN approaches do not consistently outperform the state-of-the-art shallow models by a notable margin.
 Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is therefore proposed to adapt the model trained on the source image domain (dataset) with identity labels to the target image domain (dataset) with no identity annotations.
 For instance, consider the task of recognizing products in supermarkets.
Unfortunately, this simple update rule has been shown to suffer from overestimation bias (Thrun & Schwartz, 1993; van Hasselt, 2010).
While federated learning promises better privacy and efficiency, existing methods ignore the fact that the data on each node are collected in a non-i.i.d manner, leading to domain shift between nodes (Quionero-Candela et al., 2009).
 The `1 regularizer, originally proposed by Tibshirani (1996), can be easily optimized through gradient descent for its convex and almost everywhere differentiable property.
 Furthermore, the downstream task results are often reported for a single random seed, which leaves unanswered the question of robustness of the search strategies.
 To address this requirement, we need to take a generative approach to trajectory forecasting that can fully characterize the multimodal distribution of future trajectories.
 At each iteration, a minibatch of the m training examples are drawn randomly, and the obtained gradient is an unbiased estimate of the true gradient.
 A human easily achieves lifelong learning, but this is nontrivial for a machine; thus lifelong learning is a vital step toward artificial general intelligence.
 Forcing the drivers to selflessly contribute may increase the income for the company in a short-term but it will finally causes the low efficient and unsustainable of that company in the ∗Indicates equal contribution.
 However, the learned convolution filters are graph-specific and cannot generalize to different graphs.
 In addition, by tracking the confidence in decisions, dataset shifts can be detected and developers can build insights towards improving the model performance.
In general, sample points from a DPP tend to distribute diversely within a bounded space A (Kulesza et al., 2012).
 For instance, the rankings of the six “pure” ML methods submitted to M4 competition were 23, 37, 38, 48, 54, and 57 out of a total of 60 entries, and most of the best-ranking methods were ensembles of classical statistical techniques (Makridakis et al., 2018b).
 Task heterogeneity has been regarded as one of the most challenging issues in meta-learning, and thus it is desirable to design meta-learning models that effectively optimize each of the heterogeneous tasks.
 On one hand, sample-based methods (Neal, 1993) and variational approaches (Jordan et al., 1999; Welling & Sutton, 2005; Salakhutdinov & Larochelle, 2010) are proposed to infer the latent variables.
 Therefore, there is increasing attention from the research community to study the compression of modern deep neural networks that are typically over-parameterized and computationally costly.
 Weakly supervised learning is an example of such tasks.
 Many recent works in continual learning of deep networks (Li & Hoiem, 2016; Lee et al., 2017; Shin et al., 2017; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Riemer et al., 2019; Chaudhry et al., 2019) tackle this problem by introducing advanced regularizations to prevent drastic change of network weights.
 The learning updates must be incremental – i.e, the model is updated at each task only using the new data and the old model, without access to all previous data (from earlier tasks) – due to speed, security and privacy constraints.
 The new attack methodology, which we call the Feature Distribution Attack (FDA), leverages class-wise and layer-wise deep feature distributions of a substitute DNN to generate adversarial examples that are highly transferable to a blackbox target DNN.
 For the CVRP itself, a number of RLbased methods have been proposed in the literature (Nazari et al., 2018; Kool et al., 2019; Chen & Tian, 2019).
 Two classes of fine-tuned architecture are typically built on top: Bi-encoders and Cross-encoders.
 But the inference cost of the layer-wise quantized CNNs is still prohibitive for low-power mobile devices powered by batteries.
Mainstream NAS algorithms typically search for the connection topology and transforming operation accompanying each connection from a predefined search space.
 For example, Egorov (2015) tries to solve POMDPs by using the belief of the agent as the input of DQN (Mnih et al., 2015), but this algorithm needs access to the environment model.
 Such an on-policy requirement increases the difficulty of sample-efficient learning.
Recently, there has been a revival of approaches inspired by the InfoMax principle (Linsker, 1988): Choose a representation g(x) maximizing the mutual information (MI) between the input and its representation, possibly subject to some structural constraints.
However, there is a lack of analysis in the middle of this spectrum.
 Correspondingly, many defense methods that aim to increase robustness to attacks have been proposed.
 Two operations are involved in the quantization process, namely clipping and projection.
 Regret minimization techniques are first introduced to solve TEGIs based on the observation that minimizing the regrets of both players makes the time-averaged strategy converge to the Nash Equilibrium (NE) (Nisan et al., 2007).
Here, we define the knowledge of an intermediate layer of the DNN as the set of visual concepts that are encoded by features of an intermediate layer.
 These effects not only frequently cause errors already during image-based shape reconstruction, but are also hard to reproduce when re-rendering an object from novel viewpoints.
 RTE and NLI view a premise sentence as the evidence, claim verification views passage collection like Wikipedia1 as the evidence, NLVR/NLVR2 views images as the evidence.
MAML has proven to be successful for many applications.
 Nonetheless, MANNs have barely simulated general-purpose computers.
 And second, the robot must identify how to reach distant goals when only provided with the final goal state, a sparse indication of the task, as opposed to a shaped cost that implicitly encodes how to get there.
 This scalability issue is addressed in multi-agent RL (MARL), where each agent learns its individual policy from only local observations.
 The order of the elements in the set is irrelevant, so the feature vector the encoder produces should be invariant to permutations of the elements in the set.
In this paper, inspired by the fact that the training objectives of both the approaches for grammar induction and for training LMs are identical, namely, (masked) language modeling, we investigate whether pre-trained LMs can also be utilized for grammar induction/unsupervised parsing, especially without training.
 The goal is to predict which entity might be a tail given query 〈head, rel, ?〉.
On the one hand, many previous methods try to solve this problem in the inference phase, by introducing transformations on the input images.
 These methods typically impose constraints to encourage independence among latent variables.
 As Lake & Baroni (2018) put it: “Once a person learns the meaning of a new verb ‘dax’, he or she can immediately understand the meaning of ‘dax twice’ and ‘sing and dax’.” Similarly, we can learn a new object shape and then understand its compositions with previously learned colors or materials (Johnson et al., 2017; Higgins et al., 2018).
Besides, the methods on verification and training provably robust networks have been proposed (Dvijotham et al., 2018a;b; Hein & Andriushchenko, 2017; Wong & Kolter, 2018).
A possible way such an implicit bias may present itself, is if gradient-based methods were to search the hypothesis space for possible solutions of gradually increasing complexity.
The information bottleneck is generally intractable, but can be approximated using variational inference (Alemi et al., 2016).
The term Arrow of Time was coined by the British astronomer Eddington (1929) to denote this inherent asymmetry, which he attributed to the non-decreasing nature of the total thermodynamic entropy of an isolated system, as required by the second law of thermodynamics.
 Currently, one of the best∗Corresponding authortechniques to defend against adversarial attacks (Athalye et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019) is adversarial training (Madry et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019a), which improves the adversarial robustness by injecting adversarial examples into the training data.
 Since then, more and more sophisticated architectures have been designed enabling them to identify increasingly abstract features.
 Note that D only contains the outcome of the administered treatment (aka observed outcome: yi), but not the outcome(s) of the alternative treatment(s) (aka counterfactual outcome(s): yti for t ∈ T \\\\ {ti}), which are inherently unobservable.
 The options discovered with such an approach encourage agents to navigate to parts of the state space that are infrequently visited.
 1) Training of GANs are tricky and sensitive to hyperparameters.
The Transformer therefore represents a relational inductive bias, where a relation from entity j to entity i is perceived to the extent that qi · kj is large and positive.
 And even if a demonstration precisely communicates what the task entails, it might not precisely communicate how to accomplish it in new situations.
 This is required for the subsequent driving decision making process, which needs the built trajectories to predict future moving trajectories for these obstacles and then plan a driving path accordingly to avoid collisions with them.
 A recent study (Zhang et al., 2017) shows that DNNs can easily overfit to noisy labels and results in poor generalization performance.
Compared with pre/post-processing methods such as feature squeezing (Xu et al., 2017), input denoising (Guo et al., 2018; Liao et al., 2018; Samangouei et al., 2018; Bai et al., 2019) and adversarial detection (Feinman et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018), several defense techniques have been proposed to train DNNs that are inherently robust to adversarial examples including defensive distillation (Papernot et al., 2016), gradient regularization (Gu & Rigazio, 2014; Papernot et al., 2017; Ross & Doshi-Velez, 2018; Tramèr et al., 2018), model compression (Das et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018) and activation pruning (Dhillon et al., 2018; Rakin et al., 2018), among which ∗Equal contribution.
 The operator, on the other hand, should not be able to recover original signals or their interpretation.
The goal of this paper is to take a step toward understanding momentum-based SGD in the interpolating setting.
 Once pre-trained, networks can be applied to a target task by using only a modest amount of labelled data.
 The hope is that such representations will be interpretable, maximally compact, allow for counterfactual reasoning and be useful for a large variety of downstream tasks (Bengio et al., 2013; Peters et al., 2017; LeCun et al., 2015; Bengio et al., 2007; Schmidhuber, 1992; Lake et al., 2017; Goodfellow et al., 2009; Lenc & Vedaldi, 2015; Tschannen et al., 2018; Higgins et al., 2018; Suter et al., 2019; Adel et al., 2018; van Steenkiste et al., 2019; Locatello et al., 2019a; Gondal et al., 2019).
 However, the specific mechanism by which over-parameterisation operates is still largely a mystery.
 Nonetheless, OOD detection is not limited to classification tasks nor to labeled data sets.
 In practice, changes to goals and to environment dynamics tend to occur simultaneously—given some goal, we need to find and interpret relevant information to understand how to achieve the goal.
 Universality was also shown for equivariant functions and a particular shallow architecture (Keriven & Peyré, 2019).
 We only have access to the data in the current domain, but hope to build a unified model that performs well on all the domains that we have encountered (Xu et al., 2014; Rusu et al., 2016; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017).
While RL has been used to achieve expert-level performance in some sparsely rewarding games (Silver et al., 2016; OpenAI, 2018; Vinyals et al., 2019), success has often required carefully engineered curricula to bootstrap learning, such as learning from millions of expert games or hand-crafted shaping rewards.
 The first is related to structural identifiability (Bellman & Åström, 1970): the theoretical possibility (a priori) to learn a unique optimal parameterization of a statistical model.
 As a result, many latest progresses in RL has been made with model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) algorithms that are capable of solving complex tasks at the cost of large number of samples (Schulman et al., 2017; Heess et al., 2017; Schulman et al., 2015; Mnih et al., 2013; Lillicrap et al., 2015; Haarnoja et al., 2018).
 The policy learned from behavioral cloning has compounding errors after we execute the policy for multiple steps and reach unseen states (Bagnell, 2015; Ross & Bagnell, 2010).
This lack of convergence has motivated many authors to seek variants of TD learning that reestablish convergence guarantees, such as two timescale algorithms.
Given this strong empirical performance, we are interested in employing meta-learning frameworks in NLP.
 Sutskever et al., (2013) demonstrate that training deep neural nets by SGD with stochastic momentum helps achieving in faster convergence compared with the standard SGD (i.g, without momentum).
RL has been applied in settings as varied as autonomous driving (Dosovitskiy et al., 2017), negotiation (Lewis et al., 2017) and automated trading (Noonan, 2017).
 In order for a complex generative model to be able to effectively predict future events, it must build up an internal representation of the world.
 For example, experiments in social network analysis have argued that deeper GCNs marginally increase the learning performance (Wu et al., 2019), whereas a method for 3D point cloud segmentation achieves state-ofthe-art performance with a 56-layer GCN network (Li et al., 2019).
 These tasks are carefully designed so that the text input alone does not convey the complete information for accurate predictions – external knowledge is required to fill the gap.
 A poor automatic translation for a single sentence can get a person arrested (Hern (2018)) or ruin company’s reputation.
 Recent work has started to frame many canonical tasks in computer architecture as analogous prediction problems, and have shown that deep learning has the potential to outperform traditional heuristics (Hashemi et al., 2018).
The recent success of neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms has shed light on the new horizon in designing better semantic segmentation models, especially under latency of other resource constraints.
 Another related area is adversarial training Goodfellow et al., (2015), where classifiers are trained to resist adversarial examples, which are unseen during the training phase.
To address this issue, AUC maximization has been proposed as a new learning paradigm (Zhao et al., 2011).
 Most of the existing defenses are based on adversarial training (Szegedy et al., 2013; Madry et al., 2017; Goodfellow et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2015; Athalye et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020).
 Hinton et al., (2018) showed that capsule models are more robust to simple adversarial attacks than CNNs but Michels et al., (2019) showed that this is not the case for all attacks.
 Besides, the proposed defenses have been shown to be limited and often not effective and easy to overcome (Athalye et al., 2018).
 While humans are good at solving these tasks by extracting crucial information from the past observations, deep RL agents often have difficulty acquiring satisfactory policy and achieving good data efficiency, compared to those in fully observable tasks (Hafner et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019).
 This research is often practiced through the development of neural agents which are made to communicate with each other to accomplish specific tasks (for example, playing a game).
 The score-based attack requires a loss-oracle, which enables the attacker to query the target network at multiple points to approximate its gradient.
 Second, collect the human label for each image in the test set to identify its ground-truth category.
When finetuning a big, pretrained language model, dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) has been used as a regularization technique to prevent co-adaptation of neurons (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019).
 In reinforcement learning, the transition probability distribution is unknown.
 A fundamental issue is to understand the source of this improvement.
 Fortunately, it was observed that a trained network could be reduced to smaller sizes without much accuracy loss.
It is well-known that poor local minima exist in the loss landscape of shallow networks of arbitrary width.
 However, OOD detection performance of deep generative models has been called into question since they have been observed to assign a higher likelihood to the OOD data than the training data (Nalisnick et al., 2019; Choi et al., 2018).
 Although SSMs are traditionally designed under the guidance of domain-specific knowledge or tractability consideration, recently introduced deep SSMs (Fraccaro, 2018) use neural networks (NNs) to parameterize flexible state transitions and emissions, achieving much higher expressivity.
 Each worker node pulls the latest model parameters from the server, computes all gradients and pushes them back for updating.
 Lowe et al., (2017) proposed a centralized actor-critic architecture to address the partial observability in MASs.
Our work provides a general and convenient way for human users to control the dynamic development of a given video.
 In contrast to standard GANs (Figure 1(a)) that use a binary classifier as its discriminator to predict whether a sample is real or generated, SAL employs a comparative discriminator which is a pairwise classifier assessing whether the currently generated sample is better than its previously generated one, as shown in Figure 1(b).
 In general, DNNs optimized with SGD first generalize clean examples under label noise (Arpit et al., 2017).
 By aiming to recover the true latent representation, identifiable models also allow for principled disentanglement; this suggests that rather than being entangled in disentanglement learning in a completely unsupervised manner, we go a step further towards identifiability, since existing literature on disentangled representation learning, such as β-VAE (Higgins et al., 2017), β-TCVAE (Chen et al., 2018), DIP-VAE (Kumar et al., 2017) and FactorVAE (Kim & Mnih, 2018), are neither general endeavors to achieve identifiability; nor do they provide theoretical guarantees on recovering the true latent sources.
 As a response, certified robustness (e.g, Wong & Kolter (2018); Raghunathan et al., (2018a); Liu et al., (2018); Lecuyer et al., (2019); Cohen et al., (2019)) against adversarial perturbations has been developed.
 Therefore, in this paper, we focus on how to devise model-free RL algorithms for efficient exploration that scale to large complex state spaces and have strong theoretical underpinnings.
 The previous practice is to combine base networks pre-trained for image recognition and NLP respectively in a task-specific way.
 However, such a mechanism is an inefficient one, as the emergent representations encode semantics and deformation together, instead of as disjoint notions.
 There is both a range of Bayesian MonteCarlo approaches (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Welling & Teh, 2011; Garipov et al., 2018; Maddox et al., 2019), as well as non-Bayesian approaches, such as random-initialization (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) and bagging (Murphy, 2012; Osband et al., 2016), to generating ensembles.
 Several recent works (Mikami et al., 2018; Ying et al., 2018; Yamazaki et al., 2019; Goyal et al., 2017) have shown that SSGD can achieve large speedups while maintaining high accuracy.
 Gaining access to a modular organization of generative models would benefit the interpretability and allow extrapolations, such as generating an object in a background that was not previously associated with this object, as illustrated in a preview of our experimental results in fig. 1.
 These can be useddirectly by a differentiable physics engine (Degrave et al., 2016; Belbute-Peres et al., 2018) to learn the parameters of a scene where the family of differential equations governing the system are known (e.g, objects connected by a spring), but the corresponding parameters are not (e.g, spring constant).
 For these reasons, numerous papers have studied different ways to learn distances that satisfy the triangle inequality (Xing et al., 2003; Yang and Jin, 2006; Brickell et al., 2008; Kulis et al., 2013).
 Despite these heuristics being widely used to various degrees of success, the relation between the performance of a model in the small- and large-scale settings is not well understood.
 Many questions—e.g, what’s the most recent movie that Quentin Tarantino directed? or which nearby restaurants have vegetarian entrees and take reservations?—are best answered by knowledge-based question-answering (KBQA) methods, where an answer is found by accessing a KB.
 Automatically inferring correct loop invariants is a challenging problem that is undecidable in general and difficult to solve in practice (Blass & Gurevich, 2001; Furia et al., 2014).
 Typically, methods have been evaluated on accuracy alone, even though accuracy is influenced by many other factors besides the search algorithm.
 The significance of video prediction primarily lies in its potential of discovering dynamics in the physical world.
Ranking through comparisons has been investigated for machine learning.
 It is a significant component of human intelligence and is essential in negotiation, debate and writing etc.
 However, combining appearance and motion information is an open problem and the study on how and where different modalities should interchange representations and what temporal aspect/resolution each stream (or module) should focus on has been very limited.
 Many popular techniques for generating representation are based on the Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) model (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014).
 Learning a VAE amounts to the optimization of an objective balancing the quality of samples that are autoencoded through a stochastic encoder–decoder pair while encouraging the latent space to follow a fixed prior distribution.
 To address this issue, there are many approaches either manually or automatically modify the backbone network.
Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents also use CNNs to gain perception and learn policies directly from image sequences.
 This work investigates these issues for the graph representation learning field, by providing a uniform and rigorous benchmarking of state-of-the-art models.
 This is important because small initial weights may promote vanishing gradients; it is advisable instead to choose initial weights that maintain a strong but non-exploding signal as computation flows through the network (see LeCun et al., 2012; Glorot and Bengio, 2010; Saxe et al., 2013; He et al., 2015).
 OGD iteratively performs descent step towards gradient direction with a predetermined step size, which is oblivious to the characteristics of the data being observed.
 This focus is reasonable since changes in the statistics of the data distribution are usually an artefact of learning different tasks sequentially.
 We describe various formulations and how they relate to each other as well as connect more recent architectural developments (e.g, hypernetworks Ha et al., (2017), dynamic convolutions Wu et al., (2019)) to the rich and longer-standing literature on multiplicative interactions.
Limitations and challenges: Recent work by Xu et.al. (Xu et al., 2019) indicated that most recently proposed GNNs were designed based on empirical intuition and heuristic approaches.
 For complex tasks, which are often difficult to describe formally, these RL methods become impractical.
 Since a large part of the model has already been trained on a similar task, the weights are usually kept frozen and only the new layers are trained on the new task.
 While documents are abundant on the Web, it is difficult to obtain large scale dialogues that are naturally grounded on the documents for learning of a neural generation model.
The previous works, such as the Deep3D (Xie et al., 2016), have addressed the right-view generation problem in a fully supervised fashion when the input is the left-view to which the output is the synthetic right-view at a fixed camera shift.
 This is because the linear form allows us to develop simple but efficient and scalable techniques (like self-attention which operates at constant parallel time complexity1) to train models at a large scale.
The dominating eigenvalues are the principal components of the data followed by a high number of small eigenvalues.
 With the recent development in deep learning (LeCun et al., 2015), MARL with function approximation achieves tremendous empirical successes in applications, including Go (Silver et al., 2016; 2017), Poker (Heinrich and Silver, 2016; Moravčı́k et al., 2017), Star Craft (Vinyals et al., 2019), Dota (OpenAI, 2018), autonomous driving (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2016), multi-robotic systems (Yang and Gu, 2004), and solving social dilemmas (de Cote et al., 2006; Leibo et al., 2017; Hughes et al., 2018).
 Verification guarantees can reassure the user that the network behaves as expected.
Maximum mean discrepancy networks (MMD-nets) (Li et al., 2015; Dziugaite et al., 2015) are a class of generative models that are trained to minimize the MMD (Gretton et al., 2012) between the true data distribution and the model distribution.
We introduce a new representation for programs and their specifications, based on the principle that to represent a program, we can use a set of simpler programs.
 These clip-based models often ignore the video-level structure and long-range spatiotemporal dependency during training, as they only sample a small portion of the entire video.
 The skills are constructed so that successful execution of each option in the chain allows the agent to execute another option, which brings it closer still to its eventual goal.
 Unfortunately, such traces are commonly destroyed during online dissemination, since social networks are forced to aggressively compress digital media to optimize storage and bandwidth expenditures - especially on mobile devices (Cabral & Kandrot, 2015).
However, it has been observed that these optimization methods may converge to bad/suspicious local optima, and have to resort to a warmup heuristic \\u2013 using a small learning rate in the first few epochs of training to mitigate such problem (Vaswani et al., 2017; Popel & Bojar, 2018).
 However, this kind of shaping is brittle and requires manual insight, and is often impossible when ground truth state observations are unavailable, such as when learning from image observations.
 In this paper, we focus on the few-shot classification problem where each task is defined as a N -way classification problem with k samples (shots) per class available for training.
 We have released the code for our method as part of disentanglement_lib
In this work, we identify and leverage feature interactions that represent how a recommender system generally behaves.
 In particular, higher estimated MI between observations and learned representations do not seem to indicate improved predictive performance when the representations are used for downstream supervised learning tasks (Tschannen et al., 2019).
 They also offer the ability to imagine environments for training (Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018).
While many of the early GAN variants demonstrated improvements in sample quality (Yu et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2017), they often ignored loss of sample diversity.
 However, as illustrated in the seminal work Isola et al., (2017), encoding the diversity with an input latent code can lead to unsatisfactory performance for the following reasons.
It has been shown that low precision networks can be trained with stochastic gradient descent by updating high precision weights that are quantized, along with activations, for the forward and backward pass (Courbariaux et al., 2015; Esser et al., 2016).
 How close are we to this dream? Traditional computer graphics can render photorealistic 3D scenes, but cannot automatically generate detailed content.
 This standard approach has two important issues: (i) pixel-level labelling is extremely time consuming.
 The assumption of access to the underlying gradient does not however reflect real world scenarios.
 These limitations have sparked great interest in developing novel deep approaches to unsupervised AD (Erfani et al., 2016; Zhai et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017; Ruff et al., 2018; Deecke et al., 2018; Ruff et al., 2019; Golan & El-Yaniv, 2018; Pang et al., 2019; Hendrycks et al., 2019a;b).
 Conservative prognostications of dataset sizes – particularly for practical endeavors such as self-driving cars (Bojarski et al., 2016), assistive medical robots (Taylor et al., 2008), and medical analysis (Fatima & Pasha, 2017) – suggest one will train on datasets orders of magnitude larger than those that are publicly available today.
 The key caveat with dense features is that unlike bag-of-words features they cannot be efficiently searched through an inverted index, without approximations.
 The finite sample analysis of TD has also been studied in Bhandari et al., (2018); Dalal et al., (2018a); Cai et al., (2019); Srikant and Ying (2019).
Distribution matching via adversarial learning, or Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL), has recently become a popular approach for imitation learning (Ho & Ermon, 2016; Fu et al., 2017; Ke et al., 2019; Kostrikov et al., 2019).
One highly successful meta-learning algorithm has been Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) (Finn et al., 2017).
 Concretely, suppose we have n training data points each with norm 1, and let γi be the output margin on the i-th example.
 This does not appear to be rectified by training on more data (Radford et al., 2019).
 Both inferring the latent prosody and generating samples with sufficient variety requires reasoning about uncertainty and is thus a natural fit for deep generative models.
 Specifically, we say that a trained model is extrapolating on a test input if the prediction at this input is underdetermined — meaning that many different predictions are all equally consistent with the constraints posed by the training data and the learning problem specification (i.g,, the model architecture and the loss function).
 Motivated by these geometric perspectives, in this study, we propose to employ mode connectivity to study and improve adversarial robustness of DNNs against different types of threats.
 This set of methods, which includes well-known algorithms such as MAML (Finn et al., 2017) and Reptile (Nichol et al., 2018), tries to learn a common initialization φ over a set of tasks t = 1, . , T such that a high-performance model can be learned in only a few gradient-steps on new tasks.
This intuition has inspired numerous models of increasing complexity (see Related Work for some examples).
 For example, in recommendation systems, q represents a user query and d represents a candidate item to recommend (Krichene et al., 2019).
 In contrast, we seek flexibility to achieve general goals for which we have no demonstrations.
 While the framework of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) (Littman, 1994; Stone and Veloso, 2000; Shoham et al., 2003) has been equipped with methods in deep reinforcement learning (RL) (Mnih et al., 2015; Lillicrap et al., 2016) and shown promise on high-dimensional problems with complex agent interactions (Lowe et al., 2017; Mordatch and Abbeel, 2018; Foerster et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2018; Srinivasan et al., 2018), learning multi-agent cooperation in the multi-goal scenario involves significant open challenges.
 Despite their success, these solutions are mysterious: we lack both intuition and formal understanding of the mechanisms they implement.
 Popular Examples include C&W (Carlini & Wagner, 2017) and PGD (Madry et al., 2017) attacks.
 AutoTVM (Chen et al., 2018b) builds on top of TVM and leverage boosted trees (Chen & Guestrin, 2016) as part of the search cost model to avoid measuring the fitness of each solution (optimized candidate neural network code), and instead predict its fitness.
 When the two orientations are dissimilar, the central grating appears tilted slightly towards the surround (fig.  1a, bottom).
 For supervised classification, Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL, Larochelle et al., 2008) is among the most difficult of these tasks, as it requires the model to make useful inferences about (e.g, correctly label) unseen concepts, given parameters learned only from seen training concepts and additional high-level semantic information.
 However, this assumption obviously does not hold in reality and as a result NAT models generally perform worse than standard AT models.
 In particular, the fact of limiting access to individual party’s data due to privacy concerns or regulation constraints may facilitate backdoor attacks on the shared model trained with FL.
 (2) Prediction: Performing a forward pass (a.k.a  as probabilistic propagation) in a BNN to compute a prediction for an input cannot be performed exactly, since the distribution of hidden activations at each layer is intractable to compute.
 In short, normalization layers make neural networks train faster and generalize better.
 Despite great prospects in this field, almost all previous learned optimizers are gradient-based, which cannot be applied to solve optimization problems where explicit gradients are difficult or infeasible to obtain.
 These works utilize two core components: 1) workers that collect experience (‘rollout workers’), and 2) a parameter server that optimizes the model.
A promising approach to addressing this challenge is temperature scaling (Platt, 1999).
DNN quantization is an important technique for improving the hardware efficiency of DNN execution (Zhao et al., 2017).
Semantic parsing techniques, which map natural language utterances to executable programs, have been used for compositional question understanding for a long time (Zelle & Mooney, 1996; Zettlemoyer & Collins, 2005; Liang et al., 2011), but have been limited to answering questions against structured and semi-structured knowledge sources.
 In this work, we show that object geometries can be encoded into neural networks with thousands, rather than millions, of parameters with little or no loss in reconstruction quality.
 Exploiting recent progress on deep probabilistic models and variational inference (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Zhou et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018a; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2017b), we propose an end-to-end learning framework to construct multi-modality deep generative models that can not only generate vivid image-text pairs, but also achieve state-of-the-art results on various unidirectional tasks (Srivastava & Salakhutdinov, 2012b;a; Wang et al., 2018; Gomez et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017a;b; Verma et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018b), such as generating photo-realistic images given texts and performing text-based zero-shot learning.
 However, the existing NAS methods only target a specific task.
Complicating the problem of generating contextually relevant language in these games is the issue of partial observability: the fact that the agent never has access to the true underlying world state.
 While the merits of this decomposition have been demonstrated in low-dimensional environments (Deisenroth & Rasmussen, 2011; Gal et al., 2016), scaling these methods to high-dimensional environments remains an open challenge.
 Recently, this work often relies on advancements in graph representation learning (Bronstein et al., 2017; Hamilton et al., 2017; Battaglia et al., 2018) with graph neural networks (GNNs) (Li et al., 2015; Kipf & Welling, 2016; Gilmer et al., 2017; Veličković et al., 2018).
 The deep learning community has developed several compression methods of reducing the parameter space of filters and the entire neural network, such as pruning (Luo et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017; Anwar et al., 2017), weight sharing and quantization (Han et al., 2016; Tung & Mori, 2018; Park et al., 2017) and low-rank and sparse representation of the filters (Ioannou et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2017).
 A more general and pervasive class of graphs are multi-relational graphs1.
 Nevertheless, these graphical models known qualities and promises of improvement for machine intelligence renders the quest for structure/causal learning appealing.
 However, there is no mystery with trees: A typical tree construction algorithm splits the training set recursively into similar subsets based on input features.
 Based on these two separated episodes you might infer that there is a relationship between the woman and the man.
 Existing DST models can be categorized into two types: fixed- and open-vocabulary.
Nevertheless, that training RNNs can be challenging, and that performance can be uneven on tasks that require long-term-dependency (LTD), was first noted by Hochreiter (1991), Bengio et al., (1994) and later by other researchers.
 These include the presence of critical periods during training (Achille et al., 2019), the dramatic reshaping of the local loss landscape (Sagun et al., 2017; Gur-Ari et al., 2018), and the necessity of rewinding in the context of the lottery ticket hypothesis (Frankle et al., 2019).
 For example, in detection or segmentation tasks, the batch size is often limited to 1 or 2 per GPU due to the requirement of high resolution inputs or complex structure of the model.
 In such distributed applications, communication between agents is critical, but may also be expensive or time-consuming.
 These two issues limit ANNs applicability in the real world and present potential security risks when deployed.
 For these reasons, deep linear networks have received extensive attention in recent years.
 Similarly, recurrent neural networks such as LSTMs are effective for text (Sundermeyer et al., 2012), and certain graphical models are ideal for sentence segmentation and labeling (Lafferty et al., 2001).
 For example, back-translation (Sennrich et al., 2015) makes use of the monolingual data on the target side to improve machine translation systems, latent variable models (Kingma et al., 2014) are employed to incorporate unlabeled source data to facilitate sentence compression (Miao & Blunsom, 2016) or code generation (Yin et al., 2018).
 Moreno-Muñoz et al., (2018) has shown the effectiveness of this joint model for Gaussian processes with heterotopic data.
To reduce the human effort involved in transitioning from untyped to statically typed code, this work focuses on a learning-based approach to automatically inferring likely type annotations for untyped (or partially typed) codebases.
 First, the two inference networks for each modality (speech encoder and face encoder) are trained to extract the useful features and to compute the cross-modal identity matching probability.
 Humans excel at this task: we can effortlessly imagine plausible hypotheses for the occluded side of objects in a pho-tograph, or guess what we would see if we walked around our office desks.
When learning with long-tailed data, a common challenge is that instance-rich (or head) classes dominate the training procedure.
 As a consequence, an issue that is faced by many of these agents is the sensitivity of the agent’s policy to environment perturbations.
 This phenomenon occurs because trained parameters on the initial task change in favor of learning new objectives.
 However, DNNs also undertake a higher risk of overfitting to the data.
Modelers working with privacy-sensitive data face significant challenges in model development and debugging.
 The random noise from sampling mini-batches of data in SGD-like algorithms and random initialization of the deep neural networks, combined with the fact that there is a wide variety of local minima solutions in high dimensional optimization problem (Ge et al., 2015; Kawaguchi, 2016; Wen et al., 2019), results in the following observation: deep neural networks trained with different random seeds can converge to very different local minima although they share similar error rates.
The three most influential families of BP alternatives distilled so far are Contrastive Hebbian Learing (CHL) (Movellan, 1991), target-propagation (TP) (LeCun, 1986; Hinton, 2007; Bengio, 2014) and feedback Alignment (FA) (Lillicrap et al., 2016).
 In fact, parameters related to the NTK, such as the minimum eigenvalue of the limiting kernel, appear to affect optimization and generalization (Arora et al., 2019).
 For example, Raissi et al., (2017a;b) proposed physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to learn nonlinear relations between input (spatial- and temporal-coordinates (x, t)) and output simulated with a given partial differential equation (PDE).
 However, the implementation did not achieve optimal compression, due to an incompatibility between a FIFO coder and bits back coding, and its use was only demonstrated on a small dataset of 8×8 binary images.
 The new agent, Importance Weighted Asynchronous Architectures with Clipped Target Networks (IMPACT), mitigates this inherent mismatch.
 Learning with MLE is often sub-optimal as it does not directly optimize the evaluation metric of the end task.
 Notably, Arjovsky et al., (2017) proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), which in principle avoids instability caused by mismatched generator and data distribution supports.
 Comprehensive efforts to tackle such challenges have been proposed but at significant computational overhead in general (Rusu et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2019; Mudrakarta et al., 2019; Li & Hoiem, 2018).
One approach is to build a simulator that mimics the reward and next-state transitions in the real world, and then evaluate the target policy against the simulator (e.g, Fonteneau et al., 2013; Ie et al., 2019).
 This drop is associated with a number of factors; including the vanishing gradients in back-propagation, overfitting due to the increasing number of parameters, as well as the phenomenon called oversmoothing.
In order to prevent over-fitting to mislabeled data, some form of regularization is necessary.
 Moreover, the study of the latent space of generative models provides insights about its structure which is of particular interest as generative models are also powerful tools to learn unsupervised data representations.
 Inductive bias can be introduced as the prior in a Bayesian model, or via the choice of computation graphs in a neural network.
Related Works.
 This data is also useful for various businesses such as home insurance companies interested in assessing accident risks and utility companies interested in optimizing energy efficiency (Armel et al., 2013).
 This line of analysis proceeds by coupling the training dynamics of the nonlinear network with the training dynamics of its linearization in a local neighborhood of the initialization, and then analyzing the expressiveness and generalization of the network via the corresponding properties of its linearized model.
 One of the most effective approaches is CFR (Zinkevich et al., 2007), which minimizes the overall counterfactual regret so that the average strategies converge to a Nash equilibrium.
 For example, after the model is fine-tuned on the English MultiNLI training set, it achieves 74.3% accuracy on the test set in Spanish, which is only 7.1% lower than the English accuracy (Devlin et al., 2018; Conneau et al., 2018b).
 Deep models in reinforcement learning select sequential actions whose effects can interact over long time periods.
 However, only a small number of them generalizes well to unseen examples which makes the synthesis problem difficult.
 ODE-Nets have been shown to provide superior performance with respect to classic RNNs on time series forecasting with sparse training data.
 The overall accuracy of the trees can be considered as strength, and the heterogeneity of the trees can be measured by correlation.
 It is believed that the weights learned on the source dataset with a large number of instances provide better initialization for the target task than random initialization.
 ∗Work done during internship at Uber AI †Co-senior authors .
 For example, camera pose invariant feature extraction can facilitate object identification problems, and camera pose variant feature representations are beneficial for the pose estimation of the objects.
 Such under-sensitivity is problematic: neural models can ‘solve’ NLP tasks without task-relevant textual comprehension skills, but instead fit spurious cues in the data that suffice to form correct predictions.
Many adversarial attacks have come into the scene (Carlini & Wagner, 2017; Papernot et al., 2018; Croce & Hein, 2019), not without defenses proposed to counter them (Gowal et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019).
The field appears to be progressing steadily albeit slowly based on fig. 1
 While progress has been made leading to methods that are able to compute provable guarantees for several image and text classification tasks (Wong & Kolter, 2018; Wong et al., 2018; Raghunathan et al., 2018; Dvijotham et al., 2018; Katz et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019; Jia et al., 2019), these methods require extensive knowledge of the architecture of the predictor and are not easy to extend to new models or architectures, requiring specialized algorithms for each new class of models.
 For example, in the problem of “cross-modal distillation", we may wish to transfer the representation of an image processing network to a sound (Aytar et al., 2016) or to depth (Gupta et al., 2016) processing network, such that deep features for an image and the associated sound or depth features are highly correlated.
 Despite their variety, existing algorithms can be roughly divided into two categories.
 However, this needs lots of knowledge of human expert, and sometimes shows the weak transferability across different tasks and datasets in practical applications.
A more straightforward and direct way to achieve generalization is to simulate the test examples by perturbing the training examples during training.
 These observations motivated researchers to pay special attention to fairness in machine learning in recent years; see Calmon et al., (2017); Feldman et al., (2015); Hardt et al., (2016); Zhang et al., (2018); Xu et al., (2018); Dwork et al., (2018); Fish et al., (2016); Woodworth et al., (2017); Zafar et al., (2017; 2015); Pérez-Suay et al., (2017); Bechavod & Ligett (2017); Liao et al., (2019).
 Moreover the cells are not paired—for each cell measured in the first lab, there is not an identical clone in the second lab.
 This creates a smaller network which may be used as a student, and trained through distillation (Ba & Caruana, 2014; Hinton et al., 2015) with the original large network as a teacher to retain performance.
 These methods almost exclusively address only the problem of noisy labels during training and tend to assume that at least some noise-free ground truth is available at test time in order to properly evaluate different approaches.
In recent years, disentanglement research has focused on the learning of such representations in an unsupervised fashion, using only independent samples from the data distribution without access to the true factors of variation (Higgins et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018a; Kim & Mnih, 2018; Esmaeili et al., 2018).
 Under the white-box setting, with the knowledge of the current model, existing attacks can achieve high success rates.
 Unfortunately, finding tight bounds has proven to be an arduous undertaking.
Formally, a neural network verification algorithm aims to provably characterize the prediction of a network within some input space.
Building neural networks that are permutation equivariant by construction proved extremely useful in practice.
 Mini-batch SGD.
 Unpaired image-to-image translation models such as CycleGAN (Zhu et al., 2017) promise to solve this issue by only enforcing a relationship on a distribution level, thus removing the need for paired data.
 Instead, we consider the notion of local minimax (Jin et al., 2019) which takes into account the sequential structure of minimax optimization.
Most CL approaches (Aljundi et al., 2018; 2017; Lopez-Paz & Ranzato, 2017; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Rusu et al., 2016; Shin et al., 2017; Yoon et al., 2018) assume that the data stream is explicitly divided into a sequence of tasks that are known at training time.
For instance, consider the direction, word embeddings→ structural representations, where the structural equivalence between men→ king and women→ queen is described as being obtained by just adding or subtracting their node embeddings (positions in the embedding space) (Arora et al., 2016; Mikolov et al., 2013).
 Prior art suggests to use a sigmoid layer to turn logits returned by models into probabilities (Nickel et al., 2016a) (also called the expit transform), but we show that this provides poor calibration.
In this work, we find that zero imputation causes the output of a neural network to largely vary with respect to the number of missing entries in the input.
 The motivation of this paper is to analyze the very factors that impede deeper GCNs to perform promisingly, and develop method to address them.
 These works have been further developed to handle the multi-modality of the task (Huang et al., (2018)).
 We can make use of this natural prior information, to improve our neural networks.
 In the supervised setting, one can directly apply the information bottleneck principle by minimizing the mutual information between the data x and its representation z, I(x; z), while simultaneously maximizing the mutual information between z and the label y (Alemi et al., 2017).
 Famously, the Nyquist theorem states that when the maximum frequency of a continuous signal is known, perfect reconstruction is possible when sampled at twice this frequency.
 Unfortunately, deep learning models that contain millions of parameters tend to remember too much (Song et al., 2017), and can easily overfit to rare training samples (Carlini et al., 2018).
 Nodes of the graph are computational tasks, and directed edges denote dependencies between them.
Recent work from Chen et al., (2019) has used end-to-end learning to tackle this problem.
 A variety of methods for launching adversarial attacks on DNNs have been proposed over the years.
 By considering larger groups (i.g, considering not just translation equivariance) additional geometric structure can be utilized in order to improve performance and data efficiency (see G-CNN literature in Sec.2).
 However, most learning algorithms need supervision and rely on labels which are often expensive to acquire.
In this work, we propose a novel approach to extract any sub-network without a post-hoc pruning process from over-parameterized networks.
 Nevertheless, and despite being trained with no explicit cross-lingual objective, M-BERT produces a representation that seems to generalize well across languages for a variety of downstream tasks (Wu & Dredze, 2019).
 Structured representations also provide composability and transferability for better generalization.
 Alternatively, one can measure the quality of the mapping by using a similarity function between points.
 However, inference in MLN is computationally intensive, typically exponential in the number of entities, limiting the real-world application of MLN.
 Stability of the MPC in closed loop with the physical system requires the solution of a simpler unconstrained infinite horizon control problem (Mayne et al., 2000) which results in a value function (terminal cost and constraint) and a candidate terminal controller to be accounted for in the MPC forecasting.
Gradient compression techniques have been proposed for the standard distributed training case (Alistarh et al., 2017; Wen et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018; Wangni et al., 2018; Stich et al., 2018), to reduce the amount of data that has to be sent over each communication link in the network.
 As a pioneering work in this field, (Huang et al., 2017) show that by leveraging the FGSM attack on each time frame, an agent’s average reward can be significantly decreased with small input adversarial perturbations in five Atari games.
 With self-attention in particular, the similarity of two words in a sequence is captured by an attention score measuring the distance of their representations.
The state-of-the-art methods for infinite-horizon off-policy policy evaluation rely on learning (discounted) state stationary distribution corrections or ratios.
 This exploration exposes it to experiences that enable it to learn to obtain high rewards over the course of its lifetime.
In this paper, we attack the problem of learning from demonstrations in hard exploration tasks in partially observable environments with highly variable initial conditions.
 In meta-training, yt is provided as the ground truth.
 Further,∗equal contributionjointly modeling the input and target distribution should make it easy to detect out-of-distribution inputs.
 In this paper, we present a new method for achieving disentanglement between the class of an object and the sample-specific content.
 By moving along the manifold, one can continuously change the content and appearance of interpretable images.
 Despite its impact, directed evolution is sample inefficient and relies on greedy hillclimbing to the optimal sequences.
 First, the attack is designed for a black-box setting because in real-world examples, the attacker would normally have no knowledge of the target deep learning model and can only interact with the model by querying it.
 However, such task descriptions may not readily be available.
 However, this approach has a limitation of measuring reconstruction quality only in an input space, which does not fully utilize hierarchical representations in hidden spaces identified by the deep autoencoder.
 Various differential operators have been devised on top of these data structures to model complex fluid or solid systems.
Among the context-sensitive language models, BERT (and its robustly optimized version RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b)) has taken the NLP world by storm.
 Thus, their deployment in practical scenarios is uncommon.
 Between these two extremes, how will the IB objective behave? Will prediction and compression performance change smoothly, or do there exist interesting transitions in between? In Wu et al., (2019), the authors observe and study the learnability transition, i.g,the β value such that the IB objective transitions from a trivial global minimum to learning a nontrivial representation.
 Cai et al., (2019) and Wu et al., (2019) utilize supernets with multiple choices in each layer to accommodate a sampled network on the GPU.
 Concepts, such as curriculum-learning and warm-starting, that are related to different degrees to homotopy methods, have been explored both in the deep learning (e.g, Gulcehre et al., (2016), Mobahi (2016), Gulcehre et al., (2017)) and in the reinforcement learning (e.g, Narvekar (2017)) communities.
 Therefore, MI has found applications in a wide range of machine learning tasks, including feature selection (Kwak & Choi, 2002; Fleuret, 2004; Peng et al., 2005), clustering (Müller et al., 2012; Ver Steeg & Galstyan, 2015), and causality (Butte & Kohane, 1999).
 Such extremely high computational resources requirement is beyond the capabilities of many edge devices such as smartphones and IoTs.
 That is, training searches over all functions, but seeks functions with small representational cost, given by the minimal weight norm required to represent the function.
 This introduced a new challenge, since Wasserstein distance estimation requires the function space of the critic to only consist of 1-Lipschitz functions.
 Existing continual learning methods have focused mostly on classification tasks (e.g, (Rebuffi et al., 2017; Lopez-Paz & Ranzato, 2017; Shin et al., 2017; Li & Hoiem, 2016; Shmelkov et al., 2017; Triki et al., 2017; Li & Hoiem, 2016; Triki et al., 2017; Rusu et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2017; Elhoseiny et al., 2018; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017c; Zenke et al., 2017; Chaudhry et al., 2018)).
 Inverse reinforcement learning (Russell, 1998; Ng et al., 2000) tries to find a proper reward function that can induce the given demonstration trajectories.
 However, compared with human visual system, these learning-based segmentation algorithms are far inferior for objects from unknown categories.
 However, it is known that the Lp norm distance as a perceptual similarity metric is not ideal (Johnson et al., 2016; Isola et al., 2017).
 In fact, formally characterizing the convergence properties of the GAN training procedure is mostly an open problem (Odena, 2019).
 What is outlandish is firstly that gradient descent on eq. (1.1) with small learning rate will track the behavior of eq. (1.2), and secondly the weights hardly change as a function ofm, specifically ‖τj − w̃j‖2 = O(1/ √m).
 Objects, agents, and spaces all operate under the governance of time.
Stealing attacks dates back to Lowd & Meek (2005), who addressed reverse-engineering linear spam classification models.
 In the context of deep learning, the standard approach is to find those features using a single architecture for both domains (Tzeng et al., 2014; Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015; Sun & Saenko, 2016; Yan et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018).
When representing uncertainties over poses, the position can be modeled using a Gaussian distribution.
 In other words, the mental representation obtained by seeing a transformed version of an object, is equivalent to that of seeing the original object and transforming it mentally next.
 Different solutions to this problem have been proposed in the literature: A first possibility is to use DNNs with stochastic weights from a categorical distribution and to optimize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) to obtain an estimate of the posterior distribution of the weights.
 The most popular approach due to its simplicity is ‘negative sampling’ (Mnih & Hinton, 2009; Mikolov et al., 2013), which turns the problem into a binary classification between so-called ‘positive samples’ from the data set and ‘negative samples’ that are drawn at random from some (usually uniform) distribution over the class labels.
 One solution to guard against these problems would be a common library of NAS methods that provides primitives to construct different algorithm variants, similar to what as RLlib (Liang et al., 2017) offers for the field of reinforcement learning.
 Moreover, when decisions are made sequentially, good uncertainty estimates are crucial for achieving good performance quickly (Bellemare et al., 2016; Houthooft et al., 2016; Ostrovski et al., 2017; Burda et al., 2018).
 For example, Graves (2013) showed that deep LSTM RNNs achieved a test error of 17.7% on TIMT phoneme recognition benchmark after training with only 462 speech samples.
In order to evaluate the performance of generative models, past research has proposed several extrinsic evaluation measures, most notably the Fréchet (Heusel et al., 2017) and Kernel (Bińkowski et al., 2018) Inception Distances (FID and KID).
 As a result, in the industry such novel DL systems are kept as trade secrets or intellectual property as they give their owners a competitive edge (Christian & Vanhoucke, 2017).
 The discontinuous and non-differentiable nature of a spiking neuron (generally, modeled
 After labelling an image, these defenses then check whether there exists an image of a different label within units (in the `p metric) of the input, where is a security parameter chosen by the user.
 On the other hand, a simultaneous neural machine translation model alternates between reading the input and writing the output using either a fixed or learned policy.
 By leveraging these features, simple classifiers such as linear models can be learned for different tasks.
 In practice, we often choose a source dataset such that the input domain of the source comprises the domain of the target.
 A reasonable solution to the problem is to use convex functions as surrogates to relax the constraint of sparsity, among which the most classical one probably is the l1-norm penalty.
 Many studies have been conducted for Fully Connected Neural Networks (FNNs) (Cybenko, 1989; Hornik, 1991; Hornik et al., 1989; Barron, 1993; Mhaskar, 1993; Sonoda & Murata, 2017; Yarotsky, 2017) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (Petersen & Voigtlaender, 2018; Zhou, 2018; Oono & Suzuki, 2019).
At the lowest level, much work has been done on learning node representations– low-dimensional vector embeddings of individual nodes Perozzi et al., (2014); Tang et al., (2015); Grover & Leskovec (2016).
 Among the most significant of such physical attacks on deep neural networks are three that we specifically consider here: 1) the attack which fools face recognition by using adversarially designed eyeglass frames (Sharif et al., 2016), 2) the attack which fools stop sign classification by adding adversarially crafted stickers (Eykholt et al., 2018), and 3) the universal adversarial patch attack, which causes targeted misclassification of any object with the adversarially designed sticker (patch) (Brown et al., 2018).
 Typically, the distribution has parameters θ, which are learnt through gradient descent.
 Existing methods (Du et al., 2016; Mei & Eisner, 2017; Omi et al., 2019) that are defined in terms of the conditional intensity function typically fall short in at least one of these categories.
 Adversarial examples often appear imperceptible to human observers, and are transferable across different models (Liu et al., 2017).
 However, the effectiveness heavily relies on the availability of bilingual parallel sentence pairs with manual image annotations, which hinders the image applicability to the NMT.
 Given an input task consisting of few labeled images (the support set) and unlabeled images (the query set) from novel classes, the encoder first extracts the image features.
 Note that we use the term ‘knowledge’ here to indicate the input/output behavior of the computational model as in (Hinton et al., 2015).
 Among many recent attempts to achieve algorithmic fairness (Dwork et al., 2012; Hardt et al., 2016; Zemel et al., 2013; Zafar et al., 2015), learning fair representations has attracted increasing attention due to its flexibility in learning rich representations based on advances in deep learning (Edwards & Storkey, 2015; Louizos et al., 2015; Beutel et al., 2017; Madras et al., 2018).
 • Storage Assignment: The assignment of pallets to a storage location.
 In this paper we make a step towards understanding their expressive power by establishing connections between GNNs and well-known logical formalisms.
Understanding the early phase of training has recently emerged as a promising avenue for studying the link between optimization and generalization of DNNs.
 However, as illustrated in fig 1b, visual scenes are usually complex and contain objects interposed in background clutter.
 Visual neurons called retinal ganglion cells and lateral geniculate nucleus cells have developed "Mexican hat"-like circular center-surround receptive field structures to reduce visual information redundancy, as found in Hubel and Wiesel’s famous cat experiment (Hubel & Wiesel, 1961; 1962).
 This trend is most pronounced in the space of text style transfer tasks where parallel data is particularly challenging to obtain (Hu et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018).
 However, specifying reward functions or collecting demonstrations in order to supervise these tasks can be∗This was a large project and many people made significant contributions.
 These NAS-generated architectures have shown promising results in many domains, such as image recognition (Zoph & Le, 2017; Pham et al., 2018; Real et al., 2019), sequence modeling (Pham et al., 2018; Dong & Yang, 2019b; Liu et al., 2019), etc.
 This problem is exacerbated in important graph datasets from scientific domains, such as chemistry and biology, where data labeling (e.g, biological experiments in a wet laboratory) is resource- and time-intensive (Zitnik et al., 2018).
In this work, we investigate the issue of knowledge selection in the multi-turn knowledge-grounded dialogue, since practically the selection of pertinent topics is critical to better engage humans in conversation, and technically the utterance generation becomes easier with a more powerful and consistent knowledge selector in the system.
 These methods are agnostic to the neural network library used to build the network and are therefore quite versatile (§2.2, Figure 2, §B.5).
In this context of data-efficient global black-box optimization, Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged as a powerful solution (Močkus, 1975; Brochu et al., 2010; Snoek et al., 2012; Shahriari et al., 2016).
 This has two benefits: the embeddings can be trained on large text corpora to capture the semantic relationship between words, and the downstream neural network layers only need to be of width proportional to p, not d, to accept a word or a sentence.
 There is growing interest in learning from such efficient, albiet noisy, supervision (Ratner et al., 2016; Pal & Balasubramanian, 2018; Bach et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2018).
 Classically, these functions have been modeled as the sum of four parts: (Leach, 2001)E = Ebonds + Eangle + Etorsion + Enon-bonded, (1)where Ebonds models the dependency on bond lengths, Eangle on the angles between bonds, Etorsion on bond rotations, i.g,the dihedral angle between two planes defined by pairs of bonds, and Enon-bonded models interactions between unconnected atoms, e.g, via electrostatic or van der Waals interactions.
 For example, it has been known that the deep neural network has universal approximation capability (Cybenko, 1989; Hornik, 1991; Sonoda & Murata, 2015) and its expressive power grows up in an exponential order against the number of layers (Montufar et al., 2014; Bianchini & Scarselli, 2014; Cohen et al., 2016; Cohen & Shashua, 2016; Poole et al., 2016; Suzuki, 2019).
 By using many devices, with each device highly utilized, one could train on a large number of samples without paying in run-time.
 This condition could be a class label, time index of a time series, or any other piece of information additional to the data.
There are a plethora of classes of structured linear maps, each with a significantly different representation, algorithm, and implementation.
 For example, a recent report shows that training a single DNN can cost over $10K US dollars and emit as much carbon as five cars in their lifetimes (Strubell et al., (2019)), limiting the rapid development of DNN innovations and raising various environmental concerns.
Despite its rigorous roots, deep learning has driven a wedge between theory and practice.
In contrast to first-generation models that learn word type embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014), recent methods have focused on contextual token representations—i.g,, learning an encoder to represent words in context.
Although existing MPNNs have been successfully applied in a wide variety of scenarios, two fundamental weaknesses of MPNNs’ aggregators limit their ability to represent graph-structured data.
 As we will also see below, stationary distribution quantities are of fundamental importance in reinforcement learning (RL) (e.g, Tsitsiklis & Van Roy, 1997).
First, the training data are massively distributed over an incredibly large number of devices, and the connection between the central server and a device is slow.
 Language generation is usually modeled as a sequence prediction task, which adopts maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) as the standard training criterion (i.g,, objective).
 For instance, to ensure self-driving cars make consistent correct decisions even when the input image is slightly perturbed, the required property to verify is that the underlying neural network outputs the same correct prediction for all points within a norm ball whose radius is determined by the maximum perturbation allowed.
 Thus, even when trained solely as classifiers, the performance of generative models is far below the performance of the best discriminative models.
 However, for modern MDPs, the data that encodes the value function usually lies in thousands or millions of dimensions (Gorodetsky et al., 2018; 2019), including images in deep reinforcement learning (Mnih et al., 2015; Tassa et al., 2018).
 This unsatisfactory understanding suggests that we should re-evaluate the inner workings of our algorithms.
 Moreover, the new task may come from a distribution that is different from the task distribution the model has been trained on (out-of-distribution task) (See (a) of Figure 1).
 A secondary structure can be represented by a binary matrix A\\u2217 where A\\u2217ij = 1 if the i, j-thbases are paired (Fig 1).
 In this setting, the usual (and universal) strategy of learning to reconstruct features (Weston et al., 2012; Kingma et al., 2014; Le et al., 2018) may not be most useful: learning latent representations that encapsulate the variation withinX does not directly address the more challenging problem of mapping back up to a higher-dimensional Y .
 Up to 11 thousand tokens of text in a single example were processed in (Liu et al., 2018) and when processing other modalities, like music (Huang et al., 2018) and images (Parmar et al., 2018), even longer sequences are commonplace.
 For example, cellular automata like Conway’s Game of Life (GOL) have been used to study the emergence of spatially localized patterns (SLPs) (Gardener, 1970), informing theories of the origins of life (Gardener, 1970; Beer, 2004).
 When applied to images, the relevance scores can be visualized as heatmaps over the input pixel space, thus highlighting salient areas relevant for the network\\u2019s decision.
 Further, in order to mimic latent compositionalities in objects, such a representation must be reflective of detected strengths of possible spatial relationships.
 Such highly parallelisable models are more suitable to run efficiently on modern hardware.
Natural application areas of NPs include time series, spatial data, and images with missing values.
 While promising, the main drawback of the method is that when instantiated in practice, via an approximation of an otherwise intractable optimization problem, it provides no guarantees – it does not produce a certificate that there are no possible adversarial attacks which could potentially break the model.
 One of the standard aggregation methods is FedAvg (McMahan et al., 2017) where parameters of local models are averaged element-wise with weights proportional to sizes of the client datasets.
A parameterized intelligent agent “Mario” which learns to move to the right in the upper level in Figure 1 would fail to transfer the priors from to the lower level in Figure 1 and further play the game in the new level because change of configurations and background, e.g, different shapes of ladder, new fence.
 Herein we consider pattern de-mixing problems, which involve decomposing a mixed signal into the collection of source patterns, such as separating mixtures of X-ray diffraction (XRD) signals into the source XRD signals of the corresponding crystal structures, a key challenge in materials discovery.
• (risk-averse learning) The risk-averse learning Lian et al., (2017) aims to maximize the expected return while control the variance (or risk) in the meantime:minx − Eah(x; a) + λVarah(x; a), where h(x; a) is the loss function including a random variable a, λ > 0 is a regularization parameter.
 Several other works have followed to improve such estimates under certain assumptions (Arora et al., 2018).
 The agent needs to autonomously navigate, discover relevant objects, store their positions for later use, their possible interactions and the eventual relationships between the objects and the task at hand.
 Indeed, distortions, occlusions or changes of illumination in an image, to name a few, do not always preserve the nature of the image.
 Therefore, DNNs struggle to discern meaningful data patterns and ignore semantically abnormal examples1 simultaneously (Krueger et al., 2017; Arpit et al., 2017).
 Moreover, whereas in simpler machine learning algorithms the regularizers can be easily identified as explicit terms in the objective function, in modern deep neural networks the sources of regularization are not only explicit, but implicit (Neyshabur et al., 2014).
 Unbiased gradient estimates like score function estimators (Williams, 1992) come typically at the cost of high variance leading to slow learning.
 This means that RP Tree can achieve the first goal \\u2013 high accuracy.
However, there has been little progress in learning deep representations for datasets that do not follow a particular known structure in the feature domain.
Many studies have suggested a trade-off between performance and interpretability (Virág & Nyitrai, 2014; Johansson et al., 2011).
 Recent work (Toneva et al., 2019) suggests that not all samples are equally useful for training, particularly in the case of deep neural networks.
 For instance, Li et al., (2017b); Huang & Belongie (2017); Gatys et al., (2016) can transfer the artistic styles well, but they perform poorly on the style transfer of photographs and corresponding semantics.
 For object detection, the anchor-based Region Proposal Networks (Ren et al., 2015) are widely used to serve as a common component for searching possible regions of interest for modern object detection frameworks (Liu et al., 2016; He et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018).
 And we denote the macro connections as topology in this work.
Researchers have devoted many efforts to studying efficient adversarial attack and defense (Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014b; Nguyen et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2016; Madry et al., 2017; Carlini and Wagner, 2017).
In this paper, we combine the power of deep neural networks and temporal prior in audio without any external training data.
Since the labels of the target instances are not given in UDA, adversarial learning scheme for adaptation (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015) suffers from the cross-domain misalignment, where the target instances from a class A are potentially misaligned with source instances from another class B.
The ability to fully autonomously learn to control the states of interest has many benefits.
 Such side information is a kind of user feedback to the recommended items, which is promising to improve the recommendation systems.
Recent theoretical results are trying to relate model architecture and gradient descent properties.
 In particular, the work of (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016) demonstrates that there are systematic approaches to constructing adversarial attacks that result in misclassification errors with high probability.
 Since then, a research surge has emerged to develop simple routines to construct adversarial examples consistently.
 Accordingly, we directly compare these measures of selectivity on the same set of units as well as adopt standard signal-detection measures in an attempt to provide better measures of single-unit selectivity to object category.
 Benefit from the capabilities of processing binary-spiking signal and consequential effectiveness, there is an alternative for SNNs that has a feasibility of further development of machine learning and neuromorphic application, which has been long-term significantly deployed in many neuromorphic hardware including SpiNNaker (Furber et al., 2014), TrueNorth (Akopyan et al., 2015) and Loihi (Davies et al., 2018).
 WeightNorm is widely used in training of neural networks and is the focus of this work.
 Transductive approaches (Perozzi et al., (2014); Grover & Leskovec (2016); Tang et al., (2015)) are able to learn representations of existing nodes but unable to generalize to new nodes.
 Several recent methods (Howard et al., (2017); Sandler et al., (2018); Zhang et al., (2017)) based on depthwise separable convolution show reasonable performances in terms of compression and computation reduction.
 Firstly, as is common in the literature, we restrict our presentation to a single latent representation–observation pair (z, x) to avoid notational clutter – the extension to multiple independent observations is straightforward.
 Among these approaches, channel pruning has shown promising performance (He et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2017; Zhuang et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2019).
 For example, some researchers proposed various efficient network structures (Chen et al., 2019; Paszke et al., 2016; Poudel et al., 2018; Lo et al., 2018; Poudel et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018; Romera et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019), and the others focus on the weakly- or semi-supervised learning schemes (Hung et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2016; Bearman et al., 2016; Qi et al., 2016; Rajchl et al., 2016; Pathak et al., 2015; Papandreou et al., 2015; Hong et al., 2015; Luc et al., 2016; Dai et al., 2015; Pathak et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2019; Mittal et al., 2019).
 Aside from the lack of theoretical guarantees, several additional drawbacks restrict the applications of SGD.
 By combining a non photo-realistic, simulated model with an available dataset, we can generate diverse scenes containing numerous types of objects, lightning conditions, colorization etc. Chen & Koltun (2017).
 However, the aforementioned methods often fail to do so, due to their heavy computational complexity with respect to the data size.
 Yet, these have the fundamental limitation that the models are not designed for interpretability.
This paper explores how Multi-Frame Super-Resolution (MFSR) can benefit from recent advances in learning representations with neural networks.
 However, relying solely on the model architecture while ignoring the effect of the partitioning on subsequent compiler optimizations like op-fusion can lead to sub-optimal placements and consequently under-utilization of available devices.
 As the problem of computing complete graph invariant is GI-hard (Gärtner et al., (2003)), for which no known polynomial-time algorithm exists, other heuristics have been proposed as a proxy for deciding whether two graphs are isomorphic.
 A series of pioneering works (Zhang et al., 2017; Belkin et al., 2019; Locatello et al., 2019) reveal the difficulty of applying conventional machine learning wisdom to deep learning.
 Bayesian inference can also be applied to differential privacy, where each individual sample has increased privacy guarantees (Wang et al., 2015), and to reinforcement learning, where one can leverage model uncertainty to balance between exploration and exploitation (Osband & Van Roy, 2017).
 More interestingly, Furlanello et al., (2018); Bagherinezhad et al., (2018) proposed to train a student network parameterized identically as the teacher network.
 In contrast to unsupervised training of the first stage that aims at learning representations, unsupervised training of the final stage may rather pursue one of the following objectives, among others:• Training one-class models for anomaly detection • Exploiting unsupervised approximations of the classifier risk to train a model from a prioriknowledge and unlabeled data instead of labeled samplesThe former is a special type of binary classification task, where the positive class represents ”normal” observations and the objective is to identify unknown and often rare observations that can be considered as anomalies and form the negative class.
 Variational inference (Jordan et al., 1999; Blei et al., 2017) for GP (Rasmussen & Williams, 2006) has achieved great successes recently.
The overwhelming success of distributed word vectors leads to subsequent questions and analyses on the information encoded in the learnt space.
 Other works, such as Wang et al., (2018), have shown improvement in performance by optimizing cycle consistency, i.g,enforcing the pairwise feature matches to be globally consistent.
 A BN layer normalizes the batch input to zero mean and unit variance.
 On the other hand, trust region algorithms estimate the objective with its second-order Taylor expansion but minimize it only within a local region.
While the asymmetric knowledge transfer between tasks is useful, it does not fully exploit the asymmetry in the case of time-series analysis, which has an additional dimension of the time axis.
Although it achieves great success, people usually need to deal with the optimization of the PostLN Transformer more carefully than convolutional networks (He et al., 2016; Tan & Le, 2019) or other sequence-to-sequence models (Sutskever et al., 2014; Gehring et al., 2017).
Nowadays, the practical success of BatchNorm is mainly attributed to reduction of internal covariate shift (ICS) by controlling the first two moments (mean and variance) of the distributions of layer inputs.
 For legal and ethical reasons, machine learning algorithms must make fair decisions that are independent of sensitive variables such as gender, age, or race (Louizos et al., 2016).
 Moreover, we cannot rely on a history of their individual experiences, as they may be unavailable due to a lack of communication between factories or prohibitively large dataset sizes.
 Specifically, we propose a novel learned numerical simulation metric (LNSM) that allows for a reliable similarity evaluation of simulation data.
 Unfortunately, many strong techniques developed for deep CNNs such as ResNet (He et al., 2016) cannot be applied naively to GNN, because the tasks for GNNs are oftentimes fundamentally different in nature from that of standard DNN.
One common variant of these functions (e.g, (Wang et al., 2018; Sohn, 2016)), uses a Deep Learning framework to map images to a feature vector, and computes similarity between normalized feature vectors based on the dot-product.
Several existing approaches have tried to improve the grounding of captioning models.
 For example, the Poisson equation of the form∇2φ = f is often encountered in heat diffusion problems, whereas the divergence-free (also known as solenoidal) conditions in the form of ∇ · φ = 0 is fundamental to magnetic fields, as well as incompressible fluid velocity fields to ensure conservation of mass.
 That one-sided approach poses serious risks to machine learning-based systems; since adversaries can attack a deployed model by using both privacy inference attacks and adversarial examples.
 Recent advance of proximity graphs has demonstrated great potential for fast and accurate nearest neighbor retrieval (Malkov & Yashunin, 2016; Fu et al., 2019), and the empirical performance of proximity graphs outperforms existing tree–based (Bentley, 1975; Beckmann et al., 1990; Yianilos, 1993; Muja & Lowe, 2014), locality sensitive hashing–based (Gionis et al., 1999), and product quantization– based methods (Jegou et al., 2011; Ge et al., 2013; Norouzi & Fleet, 2013; Lempitsky, 2012; Kalantidis & Avrithis, 2014) by a large margin.
 Another type of neural network, deep feed forward neural network has been well characterized as a universal function approximator (Hornik et al., (1989), Park & Sandberg (1991)).
 In the domain of printed MEs, researchers face three challenges(Anderson (1967); Belaid & Haton (1984)): the complicated two-dimensional structures, various styles of images in printed input and strong dependency on contextual information.
 One prominent line of solutions for encouraging agent’s exploration is via reward shaping (Singh, 1992; Dorigo and Colombetti, 1994), where the agent develops internal reward models to assign additional reward signals apart from the environment reward to encourage exploration.
 For instance, ResNet-152 (He et al., 2016) uses 3, 8, 36 and 3 residual blocks under output sizes of 56 × 56, 28 × 28, 14 × 14 and 7 × 7, respectively, which don’t show an obvious quantitative relation.
Many efficient architectures have indeed been designed in recent years.
 While effective, these approaches require additional supervision to localize instances, and do not generalize well outside their intended application domain.
 However, the majority of the existing defenses are of heuristic nature (i.g,, without any theoretical guarantees), implying that they may be ineffective against stronger attacks.
We demonstrate the utility of a general formulation for min-max optimization minimizing the maximal loss induced from a set of risk sources (domains).
 It is thus of great importance to develop algorithms to allow deep neural networks to achieve continual learning capability (i.g,, avoiding catastrophic forgetting).
Several methodologies are proposed recently to address the catastrophic forgetting problem.
Several network architectures have been designed to achieve (2D) roto-translation-equivariance (SE(2)-equivariance) (Cheng et al., 2019; Marcos et al., 2017; Weiler et al., 2018b; Worrall et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017), i.g,, roughly speaking, if the input is spatially rotated and translated, the output is transformed accordingly.
 Both unstructured and structured pruning approaches support pruning from pre-trained models followed by fine-tuning and pruning while training from scratch.
 Prediction of dynamic demand flow data helps ride-sharing platforms to design better order dispatch and fleet management policies for achieving the demand-supply equilibrium as well as decreased passenger waiting times and increased driver serving rates.
 Moreover, it is known that effective representations can greatly reduce the sample complexity in RL.
 Specifically, these approaches use variational dropout (Kingma et al., 2015) which adds in multiplicative stochastic noise to each neuron, as a means of obtaining sparse neural networks.
 The most famous one is Lloyd’s algorithm (Lloyd, 1982).
 Recently, (Chen et al., 2018) introduced a new type of invertible model, named the Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF), which employs ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to transform between the latent variables and the data.
 In other words, the meta-learning framework decreases task-specific overfitting at the cost of introducing task-wise overfitting.
This challenge exists in the deployment of various neural network models besides GANs.
 The training process of GANs is tantamount to a two-player game between a generator and a discriminator.
 Therefore, it is important to provide the underlying reasons for such a decision.
 There are some examples of text classification in Table 1.
 The objective of GANs isinf g sup f V (f, g) = E x∼pdata φ(f(x)) + E x∼pz φ(1− f(g(x))), (1)where pdata is the true data distribution and pz is the standard Gaussian distribution.
 Due to the highdimensional nature of longitudinal data, existing results usually restrict solutions to subspace of functions and utilize similarities between patients via enforcing low-rank structures.
 Recently, generative neural networks have advanced significantly (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Kingma & Welling, 2014).
 EBP is a method that adjusts synaptic weights in multilayer networks to reduce the errors in the mapping of inputs into the lower layer to outputs in the top layer.
A deeper theoretical understanding of the pros and cons of model-based and the model-free algorithms in the continuous state space case will provide guiding principles for designing and applying new sample-efficient methods.
 For example, a sketch of a shoe or a handbag can be mapped to corresponding objects with different colors or styles, or a semantic map of a scene can be mapped to many scenes with different appearance, lighting and/or weather conditions.
 These models pay attention either to the features generated by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pretrained on image recognition datasets, or to detected bounding boxes.
In the last few years, deep learning and neural network-based algorithms are extensively used in pattern recognition, image processing, computer vision and more.
 Since voice interfaces of ASR products are always listening and have been deployed in sensitive environment, there is an urgent need to study the security and privacy of ASR systems.
Therefore, it is not surprising that a lot of effort has gone into automatically tuning the learning rate (Schraudolph (1999); Schaul et al., (2013b); Rolinek & Martius (2018)).
 Although Ying et al., (2018) succeeded in applying GNNs to a web-scale network using MapReduce, it still requires massive computational resources.
 The solution of MAB problem involves balancing between acquiring new knowledge (exploration) and utilizing existing knowledge (exploitation), to make arm selection at each round t based on the state of each arm.
 The first one is to learn a common network with constraints encouraging invariant feature representations across different domains Long et al., (2015; 2016b); Tzeng et al., (2014).
 Much prior work has centered on data augmentation strategies based on human design, including heuristic data augmentation strategies such as crop, mirror, rotation and distortion Krizhevsky et al., (2012); Simard et al., (2003), interpolating through labeled data points in feature spaces DeVries & Taylor (2017), and adversarial data augmentation strategies based on Teo et al., (2008); Fawzi et al., (2016).
 In this context, the development of models robust to label noise is essential.
 Early works use traditional methods such as random walk (Lovász et al., 1993), independent component analysis (ICA) (Hyvärinen & Oja, 2000) and graph embedding (Yan et al., 2006) to model graphs, however their performance is inferior due to the low expressive capacity.
The situation becomes even more challenging when we want to use data from multiple source domains to build a model for a target domain, as this requires deciding, e.g., how to rank the source domains and how to effectively aggregate these domains when training complex models like deep neural networks. Including irrelevant or worse, adversarial, data from certain source domains can severely reduce the performance on the target domain, leading to undesired consequences.
Multilingual variants of such embeddings (Bojanowski et al., 2017) have also shown to be useful at improving performance on common tasks across several languages.
It converts a standard minimization problem into a composition of an inner maximization problem and an outer minimization problem.
 There are multiple approaches which seek to alleviate this problem, ranging from employing networks with many submodules Rusu et al., (2016); Fernando et al., (2017); Lee et al., (2017) to methods which penalize changing the weights of the network that are deemed important for previous tasks Kirkpatrick et al., (2016); Zenke et al., (2017); Hou & Kwok (2018).
 Such approaches are successful at compressing the pre-trained models, but they do not facilitate the training itself.
Recent advances in using the self attention models in natural language tasks have been made by first using a language modeling task to pre-train the models and then fine tuning the learned models on specific downstream tasks.
 In addition to speaker and channel characteristics, important sources of variability in TTS include intonation, stress, and rhythm (collectively referred to as prosody).
 Such models are typically trained by teacher-forcing (Williams and Zipser, 1989) where ground-truth history is fed to the model as input, which at test time is replaced by the model prediction.
These relations can be used for transferring a certain attribute of a word, such as changing king into queen by transferring the gender.
 Figure 1a shows loss curves of BERT pretraining obtained from SGD with momentum as well as Adam.
 Representations using point clouds have gained popularity as a way to capture the distribution of different types of objects (Achlioptas et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2018).
 Therefore, it is crucial and possible to reduce the computational overhead and model storage of PLMs while keeping their performances.
 Many methods have been proposed for NAS, including random search, evolutionary search, reinforcement learning, Bayesian optimization, and gradient descent.
 Nevertheless, the iso-accurate precision value depends on the dataset, task, and network architecture of interest, which greatly increases the neural network implementation complexity from both hardware and software perspectives.
 The significance of the concept that the world, despite its complexity, can be described by a few explanatory factors of variation, while ignoring the small details, cannot be overestimated.
 It is well known that training GANs is unstable and sensitive to hyper-parameter settings (Salimans et al., 2016; Arora et al., 2017), and sometimes training leads to mode collapse (Goodfellow, 2016).
 The heart of this challenge lies in that real-world human behaviours are inherently multi-modal distributed.
 For example, for objects such as cups, their colors, shapes and sizes may be different, and they cannot be accurately identified using only these primary feature information.
 On the other hand, joint methods learn representations concurrently for multiple languages, by combining monolingual and cross-lingual training tasks (Luong et al., 2015; Coulmance et al., 2015; Gouws et al., 2015; Vulic & Moens, 2015; Chandar et al., 2014; Hermann & Blunsom, 2013).
 In this paper, we define scalability from three perspectives: graph scalability, data scalability, and label scalability.
 First, we do not know how these models are going to operate in our intended application domain.
 It also has high computation cost.
 In fact, Table 1 of Brock et al., (2018) shows that for the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) metric (Heusel et al., 2017) on the ImageNet dataset, scores can be improved from 18.65 to 12.39 simply by making the batch eight times larger.
By contrast, the deep image prior (DIP) (Ulyanov et al., 2018) has been come from a part of “supervised” or “data-driven” image modeling framework (i.g,, deep learning) although the DIP itself is one of the state-of-the-art unsupervised image restoration methods.
 These graph kernel-based approaches treat each atomic substructure (e.g, subtree structure, random walk or shortest path) as an individual feature, and count their frequencies to construct a numerical vector to represent the entire graph, hence they ignore node attributes, substructure similarities and global network properties.
However, compressive networks are desired in many real world applications, e.g, robotics, selfdriving cars, and augmented reality.
In machine learning communities, most researchers resort to AutoML methods, e.g, Neural Architecture Search (NAS), in automating architecture engineering.
 We make the hypothesis that not all experiences are worth to use in the gradient update.
 Researches like Maltparser attempted to develop universal dependency parser that can be used to parse sentences from different languages without making language specific modification to the systemE. (2007).
 The reward is different for each patient (context), and there is a mapping from the context to the reward.
 In order to address those limitations, recent works propose a variety of approaches in a setting called Continual Learning (Parisi et al., 2018).
 The occurrence of positron annihilation is not affected by factors such as high temperature, high pressure, corrosion, etc., so it can penetrate the dense metal material cavity, realize the undisturbed and non-destructive trace imaging of the detected object, and obtain the detected object after processing.
 Recent models such as (Jin et al., 2018; You et al., 2018; De Cao & Kipf, 2018; Madhawa et al., 2019) are able to directly handle graphs.
 On the other hand, structured pruning and quantization are seemingly orthogonal approaches that can be naturally combined (Tung & Mori, 2018; Han et al., 2016).
 they are considered a main culprit in the failure of training deep networks successfully.
 Another group of works instead focus on modeling the uncertainty in neural network activations.
 The only restriction we place is that the target pmust have a valid subtree within the program’s abstract syntax tree (AST).
 For example, based on the resulting performance on the abovementioned benchmarks, a considerable number of researchers has even put forward the claim that their models induce universal representations (Cer et al., 2018; Kiros & Chan, 2018; Subramanian et al., 2018; Wieting et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2019).
 Take image classification task as an example, a number of factors, such as the change of light, noise, angle in which the image is pictured, and different types of sensors, can lead to a domain-shift thus harm the performance when predicting on test data.
 For example TemporalDifference Variational Auto-Encoders (Gregor et al., 2019) or Kalman Variational Auto-Encoders (Fraccaro et al., 2017) model the time-behaviour via a transition kernel pt(zt+1|zt).
 Almost all existing state-of-the-art algorithms have been developed under the assumption that given a scenario, there exists a certain underlying model which governs statistical patterns of comparison data (see Section 2 for details).
 However, it was found in Szegedy et al., (2013) that neural networks can be easily forced into making incorrect predictions by adding adversarial perturbations to their inputs; see also Szegedy et al., (2014); Goodfellow et al., (2015); Papernot et al., (2016); Carlini & Wagner (2017).
 In contrast, VAE models regularize the latent representation such that the represented inputs follow a certain variational distribution.
 Some of the well-known methods in this line of research are parameter quantization or binarization (Rastegari et al., 2016), pruning (Li et al., 2016) and knowledge distillation (KD) (Hinton et al., 2015).
It is observed that the adversarial robustness is usually achieved at the cost of a non-trivial degradation of standard performance.
 Denote the input data as x and output labels as y, and let the source and target domain be characterized by probability distributions p and q, respectively.
 Then, statistics about these regularities can be computed for small substructures of the training examples and used to construct a distribution over the relational structures.
The main challenge in eliciting private information is to properly score reported information such that the self-interested agent who holds a private information will be incentivized to report truthfully.
 It provides provable privacy guarantee by ensuring the influence of any individual record is negligible.
 In addition, we may want the system to output a final uncertainty, reflecting real-world empiricalprobabilities, to allow a safety-critical system such as a self-driving car agent to take appropriate actions when confidence drops.
 This success sparked a lot of research aiming to create better, faster and more stable general algorithms.
While admissible dosage intervals for drugs are often determined from clinical trials (Cook et al., 2015), these trials often have a small number of patients and use simplistic mathematical models to assign dosage levels to patients that do not take into account patient heterogeneity (Ursino et al., 2017).
Evaluation platforms must maintain repeatability (the ability to reproduce a claim) and fairness (the ability to keep all variables constant and allow one to quantify and isolate the benefits of the target of interest).
 Most work focuses on learning the representation jointly with the end task, assuming there is still a considerable amount of clean labeled data (Patrini et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2018; Li et al., 2017).
 Many existing popular methods require more samples to be collected for each step to update the parameters (Silver et al., 2014; Lillicrap et al., 2016; Schulman et al., 2015; Mnih et al., 2016; Haarnoja et al., 2018), which partially reduces the effectiveness of the sample.
 Likewise, the MI I(T ;Y ) between T and Y can be modeled.
To overcome these difficulties, we propose a simple, communication-efficient, scalable, privacypreserving scheme, called FURL, to extend existing neural-network personalization to FL.
We focus on the problem of generalizing between environments that visually differ from each other, for example in color or texture, but where the underlying dynamics are the same.
Several defense mechanisms have been proposed, such as input reconstruction (Meng & Chen, 2017; Song et al., 2018), input encoding (Buckman et al., 2018), and adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Tramèr et al., 2017; He et al., 2017; Madry et al., 2017).
 Especially, development of deep learning provides various learning-based solutions for super resolution Chao Dong (2016); Dong et al., (2016); Ledig et al., (2017); Wang et al., (2018b).
Saliency maps identify the pixels an image classifier uses for its prediction; as such, they can be used as a tool to understand why a classifier is fooled.
 Recent researches have shown that deep convolutional network has powerful ability in information acquisition and image processing.
 At the same time, much of the state-of-the-art performance on highly contested benchmarks—such as the image classification dataset ImageNet—have been produced with SGDM (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; He et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2017; Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Ren et al., 2015; Howard et al., 2017).
 The depthwise separable convolution achieved comparable accuracy compared to standard spatial convolution with hugely reduced parameters and FLOPs.
 While there has been a considerable effort towards methods and frameworks that automate DNN architecture search (Elsken et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2019; Dong & Yang, 2019) and training hyper-parameter search (Golovin et al., 2017; Mutny & Krause, 2018; Kandasamy et al., 2019); the process of searching for the right training data distribution (also called dataset curation) is still performed by experts, requiring several heuristics and significant manual effort.
Representation learning is a popular framework for unsupervised learning that aims to learn transferable representations from unlabeled data (Bengio et al., 2013).
 Thus, the k nearest neighbor (KNN), one of popular and simple methods, can easily handle the multi-label classification.
 Insights about the data generation process can result both in the development of new machine learning techniques as well as advances in industrial applications.
 Despite its success, scaling OT to big data applications has not been without challenges, since it suffers from the curse of dimensionality (Dudley, 1969; Weed & Bach, 2017).
 It is very challenging to impute the missing data because of the diversity of the missing patterns: sometimes almost random while sometimes following various characteristics.
 To better integrate LfD with reinforcement learning, increasing efforts turn to reinforcement learning from demonstrations (RLfD), with a relaxation to the demonstration optimality assumption, which can lead to significantly boost sample efficiency of the RL process.
 And what’s more, performing multi-tasks needs more credible feature extraction execution and multi-scale complementary features integration.
 Specifically, using binary codes, a weight vector is represented as ∑q i=1(αi ∑v j=1 bi,j), where q is the number of quantization bits, v is the vector size, α is a scaling factor (α ∈ R), and bi,j is a binary code (bi,j ∈ {−1,+1}).
Researchers have used a wealth of techniques ranging from reinforcement learning, where a controller network is trained to sample promising architectures (Zoph and Le, 2017; Zoph et al., 2018; Pham et al., 2018), to evolutionary algorithms that evolve a population of networks for optimal DNN design (Real et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018b).
 The softmax function is defined as follows:σ(zi) = ezi∑C j=1 e zj for i = 1, ..., C and z ∈ RCHendrycks & Gimpel (2017) state that overconfident prediction are due to the use of the fast-growing exponential function in the softmax computation.
 Multiple recent works (Lipton et al., 2016; Yoon et al., 2017; 2018; Che et al., 2018; Cao et al., 2018), however, circumvent this two-step approach and integrate both value imputation and the downstream task in one single model.
The most studied model in the literature is linear contextual bandits (Auer, 2002; Abe et al., 2003; Dani et al., 2008; Rusmevichientong and Tsitsiklis, 2010; Chu et al., 2011; Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011), which assumes that the expected reward at each round is a linear function of the feature vector.
 However, the cost for testing deep learning models is not neglectable.
Conditional variational autoencoders (cVAEs) do not suffer from the same problems.
 It has been shown that increasing the width of a neural network will generally not affect performance on a given task or even improve it (Neyshabur et al., (2017); Geiger et al., (2019)), and it is natural to study the effect of this modification on the learned representations.
 Moreover, it is not easy to design suitable generative models because of the high-dimensionality of the observation space Gumhold et al., (2001); Daniels et al., (2007); Achlioptas et al., (2018).
 In contrast, abstractive models summarize documents using tokens and phrases that may not be found in the input article, a process requiring an advanced ability to refine, paraphrase and re-organize information (See et al., 2017; Narayan et al., 2018).
 Likewise, commonly applied thresholding of prediction values doesn’t prevent resulting large confidences for unseen classes if the data is far away from any known data (Matan et al., 1990).
 This approach appears to be promising since the total correlation of a sampled representation should describe the level of factorising since total correlation is defined to be the KL-divergence between the joint distribution z ∼ q(z) and the product of marginal distributions ∏ j q(zj).
Recent works on semi-supervised learning can be grouped into three categories: (1) disagreement based learning via data perturbation (Miyato et al., 2019) and consistency enforcing (Verma et al., 2019), (2) metric learning (Wu et al., 2018), (3) generative approaches via generative adversarial network (GAN) (Springenberg, 2016) and variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma et al., 2014).
 However, Zaragoza & d’Alché Buc (1998) showed in the 1990s that on on shallow networks the maximum softmax probability and the (negative) entropy of the probabilities strongly correlate with model confidence on in-distribution images.
 Addressing continual learning is an important research problem, since it would waive the long-obsolete assumption of “identically and independently distributed data” impeding progress towards artificial intelligence, and allow the deployment of models learning in-the-wild.
 Bengio et al., (2013) defines the disentangled representation intuitively as a representation where changes in one dimension correspond to changes in only one generative factor of the data, while being relatively invariant to changes in other factors.
 Due to physical, visual, and behavioural discrepancies, naively transferring RL agents trained in simulation onto the real world can be challenging.
First, while most of the conventional seq2seq models handle the input and output signals whose lengths are in the same order, we need to handle the output signals whose length are sometimes considerably different than the input signals.
In particular, we identify three types of metric constrained problems: metric nearness (Brickell et al., (2008)), weighted correlation clustering on general graphs (Bansal et al., (2004)), and metric learning (Bellet et al., (2013); Davis et al., (2007)).
 However, none of these works adequately address the following basic question: how does dropout control the capacity of deep neural networks? In this paper, we provide an answer to this question.
 Most work data filtering criterion or training curriculum rely on domain-specific knowledge and handdesigned heuristics, which can be sub-optimal.
 However they still lack actual reasoning capabilities.
 It has gained a big interest in the 90s and the early 2000s, guided not only with applications in natural language problems and text classification (Yarowsky, 1995; Nigam & Kosovichev, 1998; Blum & Mitchell, 1998; Collins & Singer, 1999; Joachims, 1999), but also in computer vision as in segmentation Shi & Malik (2000); Li et al., (2004).
Although multilingual models are an important ingredient for enhancing language technology in many languages, recent research on improving pre-trained models puts much emphasis on English (Radford et al., 2019; Dai et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019).
 To make the approach feasible, many studies thus employ a synthetic language that is generated on demand from templates by the environment simulator (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2018b;a).
 As a result, PCA has been shown to be effective in preserving the global structure of the data (Silva & Tenenbaum, 2003).
 It is an open question why minimizing the empirical error during deep neural network training leads to good generalization, even though in many cases the number of network parameters is higher than the number of training examples.
There is, however, a crucial problem for models with a large number of parameters: it is difficult to achieve both non-trivial privacy guarantees and good accuracy.
 This approach is flexible, computationally tractable, and allows us to work towards answering the questions raised above.
However, such methods still require the collection of millions of interactions during meta-train, which means that they face the same sample complexity challenge as standard RL algorithms.
More concretely, C-LSTMs maintain a hidden state representing the current video frame when forward-traversing the input video sequence, and are able to model non-linear transitions in time.
Unlike the traditional supervised setting, in most real-world settings we would not have access to millions of labelled examples, but would benefit if a few-shot classifier could be deployed, for example, to recognize the facial gestures of a new user, in order to improve human-computer interaction for individuals with motor disabilities (Wang et al., 2019).
 This process results in substrings sampled from random positions in the genomes of the organisms, called DNA reads.
 In our experimental section, we will demonstrate how we can use our results to train a continuous VAE that can be re-interpreted, through our main result, as a discrete VAE that uses a finite dimensional lattice.
 Predictive uncertainty estimation (Malinin & Gales, 2018) using Bayesian NNs (BNNs) has been explored for classification prediction or regression in the computer vision applications, with wellknown uncertainties, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.
 Chen & Han, 2018; Shaw et al., 2019).
 However, due to this exploitation, these classifiers perform poorly under distribution shift (Geirhos et al., 2018a; Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019) because it violates the IID assumption which is the foundation of existing generalization theory (Bartlett & Mendelson, 2002; McAllester, 1999b;a).
 Gradient sparsification (Strom, 2015; Dryden et al., 2016; Aji & Heafield, 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2018) is a promising technique for distributed SGD, which can significantly reduce the communication traffic while reserving the model convergence.
 The model error and its compounding effect when planning, i.g,a small bias in the model can lead to a highly erroneous value function estimate and a strongly-biased suboptimal policy, make MBRL less competitive in terms of asymptotic performance than MFRL for many non-trivial tasks.
 Symbolically derivable properties such as bounds, limits, and derivatives can provide significant guidance to finding an appropriate expression.
 This phenomenon brings out security concerns for practical applications of deep learning.
VI approximates the target distribution by minimizing a divergence objective.
 High confidence predictions are undesirable since they consist a symptom of overfitting (Szegedy et al., 2015).
 For strongly convex functions for example, such results show that a decreasing learning rate schedule of O(1/k) is required to guarantee convergence to within -accuracy of the minimizer in O(1/ ) iterations, where k denotes the iteration number.
 This framework makes sense intuitively because a good model should be robust to any small change in an input example or hidden states.
 However, while the convergence analyses provide a better theoretical understanding of SGD, they do not help improve its practical behavior.
While there are remote sensing communities working on applying general deep learning methods to remote sensing problems, this domain has received relatively little attention from the representation learning community.
 Building upon the state-of-the-art BigGAN architecture (Brock et al., 2019), we introduce an efficient spatio-temporal decomposition of the discriminator which allows us to train on Kinetics-600 \\u2013 a complex dataset ofnatural videos an order of magnitude larger than other commonly used datasets.
 This trend is worrisome and suggests that these vulnerabilities need to be appropriately addressed before neural networks can be deployed in security critical applications.
 In this work we investigate how to automatically search over high performing multi-task architectures while taking such resource constraints into account.
 However, this method can often lead to mixed and even negative results in RL (Joshi & Chowdhary, 2018; Taylor & Stone, 2009).
Our focus in this paper is tabular (structured) data.
 For example, Hu et al., (2018b) proposes Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks to explicitly model inter-dependencies between channels by learning channel-wise self-attention.
 In semi-supervised learning (SSL), both labeled and unlabeled data (which is often much cheaper to obtain) are leveraged to train a model.
 Neural network formalisms like the long short-term memory network (LSTM) (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) have been shown to perform well on tasks requiring structure sensitivity (Linzen et al., 2016), even though it is not obvious that such models have the capacity to represent hierarchical structure.
 The GNN maps nodes whose corresponding local structures are similar to same/close feature vectors in the continuous feature space.
 Unfortunately, this does not address the vulnerability of DNNs for unseen manipulations.
 The main result is that, under the large width limit and sufficient small learning rates, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) dynamics of a two-layer fully connected neural network with a convex loss can be modeled as a gradient flow of a convex functional of probability distributions under the Wasserstein metric (Peyré et al., 2019; Santambrogio, 2015; Villani, 2008).
 The problem of sampling from a distribution with unknown likelihood that can only be point-wise evaluated is called black-box sampling (Chen & Schmeiser, 1998; Neal, 2003).
 Recently, data-driven methods, including deep learning, have demonstrated great success in the automation, acceleration, and streamlining of highly compute-intensive workflows for science (Reichstein et al., 2019).
 By measuring the amount of inter-task similarity, we design a novel method for value transfer, practically deployable in the online Lifelong RL setting.
To formally define Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem, consider a database X = {xi}i=1,2,...,N with N datapoints, where each datapoint xi ∈ Rd in a d-dimensional vector space.
 As training data are usually noisy, the fact that DNNs are able to memorize the noisy labels highlights the importance of deep learning research on noisy data.
 Our motivation for studying link prediction in these more sophisticated knowledge structures is based on the fact that most knowledge in the world has inherently complex composition, and that not all data can be represented as a relation between two entities without either losing a portion of the information or creating incorrect data points.
 The present state-of-the-art method for adversarial defence, adversarial training (Szegedy et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Tramèr et al., 2018; Madry et al., 2017; Miyato et al., 2018), in which models are trained on perturbed images, offers robustness at the expense of test accuracy (Tsipras et al., 2018).
 One of the reasons for the vulnerability of deep networks is the limitation in the activation-based representation, which inherently focused on the learned knowledge.
 Interestingly, in a number of cases, this metadata can be measurably related to a graph’s structure (21), and in some instances there may be a causal relationship (the node’s attributes influence the formation of edges).
 Traditional methods have used heuristic rules designed by humans (Heilman & Smith, 2010; Chali & Hasan, 2015), which are usually restricted to a specific domain.
Despite promising results, these techniques still have a long way towards practical use.
 Such critics, if exposed to coordinated joint actions leading to high returns, can steer the agents’ policies toward these highly rewarding behaviors.
 In contrast to many other defenses, and to the best of our knowledge, adversarial training has not been broken so far.
 The work Madry et al., (2018) proposed a stronger defense method, adversarial training, which minimizes the worst-case training loss under adversarial perturbations.
 For a social network, attributes might represent a person’s interests, habits, history or preferences.
 Unfortunately, learning small sequence models is very challenging because of the nature of deep learning - curve fitting.
 Recently, Nalisnick et al., (2019a) identified a similar problem with generative models: they demonstrate that flow-based models, VAEs, and PixelCNNs cannot distinguish images of common objects such as dogs, trucks, and horses (i.g, CIFAR-10) from those of house numbers (i.g, SVHN), assigning a higher likelihood to the latter when the model is trained on the former.
 First, one significant limitation of the previous approaches is that most of these models are only suitable for small graphs with 40 or fewer nodes, which is mainly due to their one-node-per-step generation manner.
 Although tree search methods have achieved impressive results on a range of discrete domains, they have not yet fulfilled their true potential in continuous domains.
 For example, when detecting objects in a scene of a baseball match in the COCO dataset, which contains four objects: “Baseball”, “Baseball bat”, “human”, and “baseball glove”, the CNN-based object detection model tends to recognize the “baseball bat” as “tooth brush”.
 This pipeline requires much less expert knowledge and only needs pairs of audio and transcript as training data.
 In the clinical domain, NER and RE can aid in disease and treatment prediction, readmission prediction, de-identification, and patient cohort identification (Miotto et al., 2017).
Numerous approaches for neural architecture search already exist in the literature, each with their own pros and cons: these include black-box optimization based on reinforcement learning (RL) (Zoph & Le, 2017), evolutionary search (Real et al., 2019), and Bayesian optimization (Cao et al., 2019; Kandasamy et al., 2018).
 Examples include defensive distillation (Papernot et al., 2016b), training with adversarial examples (Goodfellow et al., 2015), input gradient or curvature regularization (Ross & Doshi-Velez, 2018; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2019), adversarial training via robust optimization (Madry et al., 2018), and TRADES to trade adversarial robustness off against accuracy (Zhang et al., 2019).
 Many insightful algorithms have been proposed to circumvent those issues, including feature engineering (Salimans et al., 2016), various discrimination metrics (Mao et al., 2016; Arjovsky et al., 2017; Berthelot et al., 2017), distinctive gradient penalties (Gulrajani et al., 2017; Mescheder et al., 2018), spectral normalization to discriminator (Miyato et al., 2018), and orthogonal regularization to generator (Brock et al., 2019).
 Indeed, the existence of adversarial examples is evidence that human perception and machine perception are misaligned, and the internal representation of a model and a human differ significantly.
 One method is to design verifying algorithms that can be applied to existing models to back-trace their decision learning process.
 Recently, multiple optimization methods were proposed, with the target to reduce the computational overhead of either the learning or the inference processes.
 However, the gradient information of attacked models is hard to access, the white-box attack is not practical in real-world tasks.
One of the most popular clustering methods is spectral clustering (Shi & Malik, 2000; Ng et al., 2002; Von Luxburg, 2007), which first embeds the similarity of each pair of data points in the Laplacian’s eigenspace and then uses k-means to generate clusters from it.
 The power of BERT does not only come from its architecture of networks, but also because it can be pretrained on a mass of text as a masked language model.
 In reality, on the Internet, JPG compression is probably the most commonly used pattern for storage space reduction.
 Recently, the use of deep neural networks has led to significant advances in this area.
 Templates encode transformation rules as regular expressions operating on SMILES strings and are typically extracted directly from the available training reactions.
We hypothesize that much of this difficulty stems from a lack of prior structure, and given enough structure in the form of supervision over intermediate program states, we can train networks to faithfully implement different algorithms.
 On other occasions, a robot is uncertain about the task it needs to perform.
 While generally true in many applications, this assumption does not always hold (Khayatkhoei et al., 2018).
 Among the existing TSP algorithms, the best exact solver Concorde (Applegate et al., 2009) succeeded in demonstrating optimality of an Euclidean TSP instance with 85,900 cities, while the leading heuristics (Helsgaun, 2017) and (Taillard & Helsgaun, 2019) are capable of obtaining near-optimal solutions for instances with millions of cities.
This off-policy, batch reinforcement learning (BRL) setting represents a challenging RL problem.
 Supervised embedding methods are critical for large- and open-set classification tasks, and are popular for few-shot and lifelong learning tasks.
 The estimated rewards serve as the reinforcement signals for robot to update its policy.
 Modern LMs achieve thier success by utilizing a powerful mechanism called “The Transformer” (Vaswani et al., 2017).
Efforts aimed at on-device training address some of these challenges.
 Object boundaries can have high curvature contours or weak pixel intensity that complicate separating the object from surrounding ones.
 Sequence modeling on source code has been shown to be successful in a variety of software-engineering tasks, such as code completion (Hindle et al., 2012; Raychev et al., 2014), source code to pseudocode mapping (Oda et al., 2015), API-sequence prediction (Gu et al., 2016), program repair (Pu et al., 2016; Gupta et al., 2017), and natural language to code mapping (Iyer et al., 2018), among others.
 A natural solution, as utilized by LIME Ribeiro et al., (2016), is to develop multiple interpretable models, each approximating the large neural network locally on a small region of the data manifold.
 A propositional logic formula is an expression composed of Boolean constants (> : true, ⊥ : false) , Boolean variables (xi), and propositional connectives such as ∧, ∨, ¬ (for example (x1 ∨ ¬x2) ∧ (¬x1 ∨ x2)).
 This is a by-product of how mini-batches are constructed.
 Autoregressive models (Salimans et al., 2017; Oord et al., 2016b;a; Chen et al., 2017) achieve exceptional log-likelihood score on many standard datasets, indicative of their power to model the inherent distribution.
 In addition to learning an agent policy, MBRL also uses the queries to learn the dynamics of the environment that our agent is interacting with.
 Therefore, many recently developed sequence learning models have completely jettisoned the recurrent structure and only rely on convolution operation or attention mechanism that are easy to parallelize and allow the information flow at an arbitrary length.
A domain where this is particularly pronounced is in the fine-grained multi-agent player motions of team sport.
In this work, we ask what is lost when we prune a deep neural network.
 In this way, the size of the searching space is decreased exponentially.
 But these lack theoretical guarantees, and they embody a one-size-fits-all approach that cannot specialize to the instance distribution.
 They have to make accurate predictions about the future states which can be very hard when dealing with high dimensional inputs such as images.
 All these approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages.
 Here, we study a key shortcoming of GAIL: the tendency of the discriminator to mainly exploit task-irrelevant features.
 It is shown that BPP is a strongly NP-hard problem (Martello et al., 2000), which requires exponential time to generate the optimal solution.
Unseen attribute-object pair recognition is a meaningful and challenging problem.
 On the one hand, there is work on showing that attention weights are not interpretable, and altering them does not significantly affect the prediction (Jain & Wallace, 2019; Serrano & Smith, 2019).
 Let (X, y) ∈ X × Y be from some unknown distribution PX,Y .
 Popular ensemble methods include Boosting (e.g, AdaBoost (Freund & Schapire, 1997)), Bootstrap aggregating (bagging), Stacking (Bishop, 2006), and Random Forest (Ho, 1995).
 Specifically, one can let w be in the space of hyper-parameters in the way that each element of w represents the value of a specific hyper-parameter and different points w in the hyper-parameter space correspond to different realizations of the hyper-parameters.
Previous visual explanation works mainly focus on the interpretation of deep neural network for classification (Springenberg et al., (2014); Zhou et al., (2016; 2018); Fong & Vedaldi (2017)).
 Besides, the difference between two synthetic routes may be subtle, which usually depends on the global structures.
 In many such applications, we can now collect an enormous number of measurements per person/subject.
The main contributions of our work are the following:
 Our work focuses on the task of unsupervised landmark learning, which aims to find unsupervised pose representations from image data without the need for direct pose-level annotation.
 (Figure 1 depicts a pictorial visualization for the coverage and discrimination requirements.) The first requirement, frequentist coverage, is especially relevant in applications where predictive uncertainty is incorporated in a decision-theoretic framework (e.g, administering medical treatments (Dusenberry et al., (2019)), or estimating value functions in model-free reinforcement learning (White & White (2010))).
 Neural-based iterative correction is developed in amortized inference for posterior approximation (Marino et al., (2018)).
 Both S2 and S3 are negative because staff are unhelpful.
 However, BF does not have a non-zero false positive rate (FPR) (Dillinger and Manolios, 2004) due to hashing collisions, which measures the performance of BF.
 The most often used approach to achieve this goal is the method of gradient perturbation, where we add controlled noise to the gradients during the training phase.
 In particular, they outperform predetermined molecular fingerprints and string-based approaches for molecular property prediction and the de novo generation of drug-like compounds (Jin et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018b).
 (Zhu et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Isola et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2018)Even with such great success, most GAN-based approaches are suffering from the imbalance between the generator and discriminator (Arjovsky & Bottou, 2017).
Let X be the sample space and Y be the space of labels.
 However, designing such informative rewards is challenging, and rewards are often highly specific to the particular task being solved.
 A learned model provides an upper bound for the entropy rate of a language, via its cross-entropy loss.
To tackle such cases, previous methods aim at defining the “quality” or “saliency” for each element in a group (Liu et al., 2017c; Yang et al., 2017; Rao et al., 2017b; Nikitin et al., 2017).
 In contrast, the black-box approach (Seo et al., 2018; Petsiuk et al., 2018; Ribeiro et al., 2016; Tian & Cai, 2017; Zeiler & Fergus, 2013; Zintgraf et al., 2017; Fong & Vedaldi, 2017) aims to be inherently model agnostic.
Meanwhile, in many real-world reinforcement learning applications, we observe that not all future rewards have dependency with the current action.
 For instance, yncij indicates output value of the location (i, j) in the c-th channel of the n-th sample.
 The transitions between these modes may correspond to the changes in internal goals of the agent (e.g, a mouse switching from running to resting, as in Johnson et al., (2016)) or may be caused by external factors (e.g, changes in the road curvature).
 Many prior approaches to this problem in the machine learning literature aim to develop algorithms to learn models that are robust to label noise (Bylander, 1994; Cesa-Bianchi et al., 1999; 2011; Ben-David et al.,; Scott et al., 2013; Natarajan et al., 2013; Scott, 2015).
 Importantly, two policies with distinct distributions over trajectories may result in the same probabilistic embedding.
 This allows clinicians to anticipate patients’ prognoses by comparing “similar” patients in order to design treatment guidelines that are tailored to homogeneous patient subgroups (Zhang et al., 2019).
 On machine translation the stateof-the-art models have parameters in the order of millions.
 In other words, doubling the size of layer inputs and outputs quadruples the size of the layer.
Despite the success of GCNs, training GCNs on large-scale graphs remains challenging due to the memory issue: we need to store all the parameters and outputs of GCN.
 Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) is probably the first along this line of research, and significantly outperforms vanilla SGD in the sparse gradient scenario.
 We note that standard initialization schemes, e.g, the Kaiming’s initialization, are designed to keep the forward and backward variance constant when passing through one layer.
 In theoretical computer vision, object tracking has been used to develop several theories of invariant object representations (Lim et al., 2005).
 The computation cost is unaffordable on large datasets.
 The latter group provides users understandable rationale for a specific decision with relevance scores1 (Simonyan et al., 2014; Du et al., 2018a).
 Recent successes of deep neural networks, though dramatic, are focused on tasks, such as visual perception or natural language translation, with relatively short latency— e.g, hundreds of steps, which is often also the depth of the network itself.
 Considering the complexity in images, these methods divide the image into overlapping patches and aim to jointly train two over-complete dictionaries for LR/HR patches.
 A number of theories have been developed for explaining the existence of adversarial examples.
 More algorithms have been developed in Wang et al., (2014); Kawaguchi et al., (2015); Springenberg et al., (2016).
 Such techniques, generally called molecular dynamics (MD), have been used to understand a wide range of systems including molecules, crystals, glasses, proteins, polymers, and whole biological cells.
However, non-adversarial approaches often have significant limitations.
 Among them, network quantization methods, jointly optimizing the whole network weights, activations or gradients with low bit (such as 8 bits or even 1 bit), show great potential in compressing model size and accelerating inference time.
 The fragility of deep neural networks and the availability of these powerful attacking methods present an urgent need for effective defense methods.
While most theoretical results of GNNs are based on the message-passing model (Xu et al., 2019; Keriven and Peyré, 2019), there are a limited number of theoretical results for the filtering approach.
 In particular, the best recurrent models operate with gating functions that not only ameliorate vanishing gradient issues but also enjoy fine-grain control over temporal compositionality (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014).
 Most of the focus in this direction has been restricted to feedforward networks and robustness to adversarial perturbations (Tjeng et al., 2017; Raghunathan et al., 2018b; Ko et al., 2019).
 Despite these outstanding advances, quantitative evaluation of GANs remains a challenge (Theis et al., 2016; Borji, 2018).
 ShuffleNet (Zhang et al., 2018a) uses 1\\u00d7 1 group convolution to further reduce computations and proposes the shuffle operation to help information flow among different groups.
 A separate approach is completely data-driven, e.g, one could repeatedly record real-world projectile tosses and use a regression model to estimate a future trajectory; unfortunately, this approach requires large datasets and lacks interpretability.
 We primarily achieve this by modelling 2D time-frequency representations such as spectrograms rather than 1D time-domain waveforms (Figure 1).
 This potential has inspired a several research efforts where either an alternative (or supplementary) feedback is obtained from the human participant (Knox, 2012).
 On the other hand, people can carefully design a small “seeding pool” so that by selecting “representative” nodes or atoms as the training set, a GNN can be trained to get an automatic estimation of the functions for all the remaining unlabeled ones.
 Much of the fairness in machine learning literature attempts to produce algorithms that satisfy Demographic Parity, which aims to make algorithm’s predictions independent of the sensitive populations (Louizos et al., (2015); Zemel et al., (2013); Feldman et al., (2015)); or Equality of Odds or Equality of Opportunity, which aims to produce predictions that are independent of the sensitive attributes given the ground truth (Hardt et al., (2016); Woodworth et al., (2017)).
 While alternative model-specific compression strategies abound (see Section 6), TSC is distinguished by its broad applicability: the same framework can be used to compress any classifier, be it a random forest or a deep neural network.
 According to Lasserre et al., (2006), the only difference between these models is their statistical parameter constraints.
 However, achieving accurate prediction represents major challenges for many existing methods due to some difficulties in urban data, such as unsmoothness.
In many real-world systems, it is common to encounter a large amount of multivariate time series (MTS) data collected from different individuals with shared commonalities, which we define as heterogeneous multivariate time series.
On the other hand, complex multimodal decoder distributions can be learned by alternative generative models, including GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and autoregressive models (e.g, pixelCNN) (van den Oord et al., 2016).
 Past efforts in machine learning to incorporate compositionality have attempted it in several distinct ways.
In the ideal case in which inliers follow a simple unimodal distribution and outliers occur “far away” from the mean compared to the inliers, outlier detection has a simple solution.
 Consequently, the XAI community has proposed a variety of algorithms that aim to explain predictions of these models (Ribeiro et al., 2016; 2018; Lundberg & Lee, 2017; Shrikumar et al., 2017; Smilkov et al., 2017; Selvaraju et al., 2016; Sundararajan et al., 2017).
VQA is one of the most active research fields in AI with strong expectation for real applications.
 The problem is serious as some designed adversarial examples can be transferred among different kinds of CNN architectures (Papernot et al., 2016), which makes it possible to perform black-box attack: an attacker has no access to the model parameters or even architecture, but can still easily fool a machine learning system.
 A hallmark of human intelligence is the capability to internalize these complex ideas by actively referencing past interpretations to continually adapt understanding.
 For example, Figure 1a depicts demonstrations from real basketball players with variations of many types, including movement speed, desired destinations, tendencies for long versus short passes, and curvature of movement routes, amongst many others.
However, unlike training a deep neural network by minimizing the classification error, training a deep neural network for metric learning is notoriously more difficult (Qian et al., (2018); Wang et al., (2017)).
 As such, if a model can only access partially-observed data, the performance will likely be much worse than those trained with fully-observed data, if not completely failing.
To alleviate the energy cost, custom hardware for neural network inference, including FPGAs and ASICs, is actively being developed in recent years.
 Therefore, prior works mostly focus on next or first few frames prediction (Lotter et al., 2016; Finn et al., 2016; Byeon et al., 2018).
 These methods aim to speed up computation and reach some final level of sparsity for deployment.
 While neural networks initially used pooling layers to downsample the feature maps between convolution layers, more recent architectures have incorporated downsampling into the convolution layers by using strided convolution (He et al., 2016).
Domain adaptation is an important research problem with diverse applications in machine learning, computer vision (Gong et al., 2012; Gopalan et al., 2011; Hoffman et al., 2014; Saenko et al., 2010) and natural language processing (Collobert et al., 2011; Glorot et al., 2011).
One interesting question about these non-convex loss surfaces is to what extent trained models, which correspond to local minima, are connected.
 The succeeding methods show that their networks for invariance can greatly improve the accuracy with a limited size of networks and data.
 More generally, big data problems are impacting virtually all research, and the ability to observe an informative subset of the original features offers important advantages.
 For example, Levy & Goldberg (2014b) proves that SGNS is implicitly factorizing the shifted pointwise mutual information (PMI) matrix.
 Potential explanations for this unintuitive phenomenon have come via experiments (Keskar et al., 2016; Morcos et al., 2018; Yao et al., 2018; Belkin et al., 2018; Nagarajan & Kolter, 2019), and the derivation of bounds on DNN generalization-gaps that suggest less overfitting might occur as parameter counts increase (Neyshabur et al., 2018).
 Since then, lots of more expressive variational posteriors have been proposed (Tran et al., 2016; Rezende & Mohamed, 2015; Salimans et al., 2015; Nalisnick et al., 2016; Kingma et al., 2016; Mescheder et al., 2017; van den Berg et al., 2018).
 Another approach is to use various forms of masked convolutions, generalizing the dimension partitioning approach of coupling layers (Song et al., 2019; Hoogeboom et al., 2019).
One promising approach for certifiably robustness is the recent randomized smoothing method (e.g, Cohen et al., 2019; Salman et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Lecuyer et al., 2018), which constructs smoothed classifiers with certifiable robustness by introducing noise on the inputs.
 In fact, the k-nearest neighbor approach has recently been receiving attention for its robustness properties (Wang et al., 2018; Reeve & Kaban, 2019) and as an auxiliary strategy for modern machine learning (Jiang et al., 2018).
 For instance, Corbett-Davies et al., (2017) and Dieterich et al., (2016) argue that COMPAS can be regarded as fair with respect to certain fairness notions.
 World graph nodes are waypoint states, a set of salient states that can summarize agent trajectories and provide meaningful starting points for efficient exploration (Chatzigiorgaki & Skodras, 2009; Jayaraman et al., 2018; Ghosh et al., 2018).
 They are often overconfident in their predictions, even when their predictions are incorrect (Guo et al., 2017; Ovadia et al., 2019).
 These edge-based methods are premised on the concept of relational inductive bias within graphs (Battaglia et al., 2018), which implies that two connected nodes have similar properties and are more likely to share the same label (Kipf & Welling, 2017).
 A group of methods are based on visualizations, either by quantifying the effect of particular neurons or features, or by creating new images that maximize the target score for specific classes (Erhan et al., 2009; Simonyan et al., 2013; Zeiler & Fergus, 2014).
 Su et al., (2018) thoroughly study the robustness of 18 well-known ImageNet models using multiple metrics, and reveals that adversarial examples are widely existent.
 Several frameworks have been developed to reason about information in fixed sets of values, for instance by Fisher and Kolmogorov, but they either do not relate directly to relevant concepts in Deep Learning, such as generalization and invariance, or cannot be estimated in practice for modern deep neural networks (DNNs).
Recently, Lu et al., (2018) identified a source of error in Q-learning with function approximation known as delusional bias.
 This is also true to critical domains, such as healthcare and fintech, where collecting massive labelled data is prohibitively expensive and/or is impossible to scale.
 In particular, Castellanos-Ortega et al., (2010) demonstrated that each hour delay in treating a patient results in a 7.6% increase in mortality.
 Although these methods work well on standard neural networks, when it comes to complex or even discontinuous models, such as decision trees and detection-based defense models, they cannot be directly applied because the gradient is not available.
To reduce negative effects from noisy labels, many methods have been proposed (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Reed et al., 2015; Patrini et al., 2017; Ghosh et al., 2017; Malach & Shalev-Shwartz, 2017) .
 However, for problems which require knowledge of neighborhood the formulation in Eq. 1 becomes inadequate.
 It is discovered that neural network classifiers may make errors on deliberately crafted inputs, known as adversarial examples (Biggio et al., 2013; Szegedy et al., 2013; Behzadan & Munir, 2017a).
 It consists of a deep feedforward network to generate new samples from a base distribution (e.g, Gaussian distribution), and a discriminator network to accept or reject the generated samples.
 Thus, there is a natural difference in the minimum amount of necessary goal information or ‘relevant information’ (Polani et al., 2006) needed at different states.
 The resulting decision boundaries are typically “unbounded/open” as shown in Figure 1a resulting in over-generalization (Spigler (2019), Scheirer et al., (2012)).
 Secondly, humans and animals can easily handle imitation scenarios where there is a shift in embodiment and dynamics between themselves and a demonstrator.
 Data-efficiency of on-policy Temporal-Difference methods can be enhanced by the use of n-step returns, where a Monte Carlo rollout of length n is combined with a bootstrap of the value function.
 However, there are many applications where task segmentation is unavailable, which have thus far been under-addressed in the meta-learning literature.
 It is then a problem of utmost importance, to design agents that make efficient use of collected data.
Most of the literature in machine learning has focused on architectural changes (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015; Szegedy et al., 2015; He et al., 2016; Zoph & Le, 2017; Szegedy et al., 2017; Han et al., 2017; Zoph et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018) to im-prove clean accuracy but interest has recently shifted toward robustness as well.
 Their popularity stems from the intuitive interpretation of the maximum entropy objective and their superior sample efficiency on standard benchmarks.
 Yet, original experiments were performed on classification tasks with shallow architectures and small datasets, and further experiments on deeper models and more challenging problems suggest that they may rather appear later, though still early, during training (Frankle et al., 2019).
 The general formulation of dimensionality reduction isf : Rdx → Rdy , x 7→ y = f(x),where f(·) is the mapping function and dy dx.
Other benefits provided by working with complex-valued inputs in the spectral or frequency domain are computational.
 Though these approaches do not always harm accuracy, aggressive compression can adversely affect the behavior of the network.
 This raises a million-dollar question: can we learn a universal image-text representation for all V+L tasks?To answer this question, we introduce UNiversal Image-TExt Representations (UNITER), a largescale pre-trained model for multimodal embedding.
 In this paper, we mainly focus on the following sparsity-constrained optimization problem:min wF (w) := 1n n∑ i=1 fi(w), s.t., ‖w‖0 ≤ s, (1)where F (w) is a finite-sum convex and smooth function, each function fi(w) is associated with the i-th sample, ‖w‖0 is the number of nonzero entries in variable w, and s represents the sparsity level.
 Alice is capable of a constructing a house while Bob appears to only be able to navigate around the world.
 Therefore, a variety of numerical integration methods have been developed to obtain accurate, but approximate solutions.
 The devices compute an update to the model based on an optimization procedure with locally available data, and the central system aggregates the updates from different devices.
 For the scaling factor 1/m, (m: the number of hidden units), Chizat & Bach (2018a); Mei et al., (2018) showed the convergence to the global minimum over probability measures when m → ∞ by utilizing the Wasserstein gradient flow perspective (Nitanda & Suzuki, 2017) on the gradient descent.
 One major challenge is the question about which problems to analyze.
 To guarantee convergence to a Nash equilibrium, one must either examine restricted classes of games such as fully cooperative games (Claus & Boutilier, 1998; Bu et al., 2008; Panait et al., 2006; Matignon et al., 2007), or devise specialized algorithms that guarantee convergence (Hu & Wellman, 2003; Wang & Sandholm, 2003).
 In the tasks we study, math or programming problems are stated in naturallanguage, and answers are given as programs, sequences of relational representations, to solve the problem.
 Many researchers attribute it to the exposure bias (Bengio et al., 2015) because the LM is trained with a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and predicts the next word conditioned on words from the ground-truth during training.
 However, almost all of them only focus on dozens of frequent predicates and do not study the generalization of the seen predicates to the unseen ones.
 More colloquially, the mutual information tells us how many bits we can predict of the future given our observations of the past.
 On the other hand, exploring the geometry space of the individual chemical compound is equally important, as the molecular geometries and their probabilities determine all equilibrium properties, such as binding affinity, solubility etc.
 Importantly, the relative positions of the atoms are restricted by the bonds in the molecule and the angles between them.
 Similarly, in computational advertising applications, information is missing for users who do not have a prior history on a merchant’s website while their global clicking behavior across websites may be known.
Existing work tries to solve this problem from the perspective of meta-learning (Thrun, 1998; Schmidhuber, 1987), which is motivated by the human ability to leverage prior experiences when tackling a new task.
 Another promising direction, which is almost neglected so far, is to explore robustness of generative classifiers (Ng & Jordan, 2002).
Recently, the remarkable progress in deep learning has stimulated increased interest in learning such heuristics based on deep neural networks (DNNs).
 Few-shot learning methods – which learn classes from few labeled examples – aim to bridge this gap.
Leveraging the location information embedded in such irregular data sources, so as to learn important spatiotemporal features, is in fact challenging.
 Inspired by the compressed sensing GAN (CS-GAN; Wu et al., 2019), we further exploit the benefit of latent optimisation in adversarial games using natural gradient descent to optimise the latent variable z at each step of training, presenting a scalable and easy to implement approach to improve the dynamical interaction between the discriminator and the generator.
 Unfortunately, directly optimizingH(S) requires an accurate model of the policy and environment (Hazan et al., 2018a).
 In particular, two families of probabilistic generative models have become dominant: Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014).
RL-based neural architecture search yielded success in automatic design of state-of-the-art RNN cells (Zoph and Le, 2017), convolutional blocks (Zoph et al., 2017), activation functions (Prajit Ramachandran, 2018), optimizers (Bello et al., 2017; Wichrowska et al., 2017) and data augmentation strategies (Cubuk et al., 2018).
 Howard et al., (2017); Sandler et al., (2018); Howard et al., (2019) used factorized operations called depth-wise and point-wise convolutions in a proposal for light-weight models suited to mobile devices.
As for the learning of manifold structure, generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) have been known for their remarkable performance.
The Omniglot (Lake et al., 2011) and miniImageNet (Vinyals et al., 2016; Ravi & Larochelle, 2017) benchmarks have been heavily used to evaluate and compare supervised few-shot classification methods in the last few years (Vinyals et al., 2016; Ravi & Larochelle, 2017; Snell et al., 2017; Finn et al., 2017; Sung et al., 2018).
 Particularly, Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) (Sohn et al., 2015; Bayer & Osendorfer, 2014; Chung et al., 2015) have been very successful – from prediction of pedestrians trajectories (Lee et al., 2017; Bhattacharyya et al., 2018; Pajouheshgar & Lampert, 2018) to outcomes of robotic actions (Babaeizadeh et al., 2018).
 Most of the current work in time series settings focus on evaluating globally relevant features (Yang et al., 2005; Yoon et al., 2005; Hmamouche et al., 2017).
These successes and others clearly illustrate the utility of learned feature representations.
 For example, NasNet (Zoph et al., 2018) presents a search space with 6 × 109 possible cells.
 Recent works (Oh et al., 2018; Gangwani et al., 2018) verify that imitation learning from the agent’s previous good trajectories could indirectly drive exploration in certain environments.
 GCNs inherently assume that the labels of interest are numerical or categorical variables.
 The cascaded achievement of invariance to such identity-preserving transformations has been proposed as a key mechanism for robust object recognition (DiCarlo & Cox, 2007; Tacchetti et al., 2018).
 Learning multiple levels of policies in parallel is challenging due to non-stationary state transition functions.
 The resulting model may be used in various ways, e.g, for planning (Oh et al., 2015; Silver et al., 2017a), generation of synthetic training data (Weber et al., 2017), better credit assignment (Heess et al., 2015), learning useful internal representations and belief states (Gregor et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2018), or exploration via quantification of uncertainty or information gain (Pathak et al., 2017).
 The basic idea is to modify each gradient of the current task such that the losses at the memories (data examples) from previously solved tasks will not increase, hence allowing positive backward knowledge transfer.
 For CIFAR-10, incorporating GAP into the kernel improves classification accuracy by up to 10% compared to pure convolutional CNTK.
 On the other hand, the additional objectives affect the primary objective more or less, whereas it is usually not clear how these additional objectives affect the primary objective.
 In addition to its rigorous privacy guarantees, it has been empirically shown to stop the leaking of secrets (Carlini et al., 2019).
An orthogonal approach to reduce computations is sparsification, a process in which we eliminate computations involving small values.
 Such a representation, while being less precise, is especially useful in custom hardware, where it allows more efficient computations and reduces the memory bandwidth.
 As a result, a technique which can generate synthetic data with properties similar to the original data is in demand.
 For example, AlphaStar (The Alpha Star Team, 2019) uses models that are pre-trained using supervised learning techniques on expert human demonstrations, before RL is used for refinement.
In ternarization, the accuracy degradation is resulted from quantizing values in a limited range with only 2bits.
 For example, patients providing medical records to build a model that detects HIV would not want to reveal their participation in the training dataset.
 Despite these strengths, the remained question is whether NP and SNP can scale to more complex stochastic processes when the individual observations about the true process are highly partial, which prevails in many situations.
The effectiveness of consistency regularization is often attributed to the smoothness assumption (Miyato et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2018) or cluster assumption (Chapelle & Zien, 2005; Sajjadi et al., 2016a; Shu et al., 2018; Verma et al., 2019).
One of the efficient ways to solve (1) is stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Robbins & Monro, 1951).
Here, we focus on two types of data structure that can both already be illustrated by considering the simple canonical problem of classifying the handwritten digits in the MNIST database using a neural network N (LeCun & Cortes, 1998).
We hope to clarify this debate.
 As the size of the transmitted messages goes to infinity for memory-less communication channels, the joint source-channel coding theorem (Shannon, 1948) states that it is optimal to split the communication task into two sub-tasks: (i) removing redundant information from the message (source coding) and (ii) re-introducing some redundancy into the encoded message to allow for message reconstruction despite the channel information loss (channel coding).
Our work has the following contributions.
 The main reason is that the training examples alone are insufficient to capture the feasibility constraints and thus to guide the model toward producing valid objects.
 However, there is no incentive to cover the whole data distribution.
 Most existing OoD detection approaches are task-specific in that they consider a certain prediction task (typically classification) and use the corresponding output labels for the supervised training of a deep discriminative model to produce the desired target output as well as some confidence score (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016; Hendrycks et al., 2018; Liang et al., 2017).
 For example, for the node classification problem, after several levels of neighborhood aggregation, the node representation may be able to incorporate sufficient higher-order neighborhood information to discriminate different classes (Xu et al., 2019).
 As a result, more attention has been given to methods that provide formal guarantees about performance in the presence of adversarial perturbations (Liu et al., 2019), with the state of the art now providing non-trivial guarantees for the MNIST test set (Wong & Kolter, 2018; Croce et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018).
Feature selection methods may be classified into three major categories: filter methods, wrapper methods, and embedded methods.
In the following we outline the desiderata of methods to learn sparse representations of discrete objects: 1) General-purpose: Good representation learning methods should be as flexible, modular, and as general as possible to be easily adapted for various applications.
 However, the convergence guarantee of deep Q-learning algorithms remains a largely open problem.
 A variety of approximations have been developed for Bayesian neural networks, including Laplace approximation (MacKay, 1992), Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (Neal, 1996; Welling & Teh, 2011; Springenberg et al., 2016), variational Bayesian methods (Graves, 2011; Blundell et al., 2015; Louizos & Welling, 2017; Wen et al., 2018) and Monte-Carlo dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Srivastava et al., 2014).
 This comes at two striking costs.
 As existing reinforcement learning approaches already have poor sample complexity, this makes direct use of pixel-based inputs prohibitively slow.
 UAPs do not require any optimization on the input image at attack time, but the corruption effectively works for most of the images.
 Hence, each local dataset would not follow the population distribution, and handling the decentralized non-IID data still remains a statistical challenge in the field of federated learning (Smith et al., 2017).
 In this paper we wish to take a step towards demystifying this phenomenon and help explain why neural nets can overfit to noise yet have the ability to generalize when real data sets are used for training.
 To address the issue of non-differentiablity, researchers and practitioners use score function gradient estimators such as REINFORCE to train GANs for text generation, where the discriminator is cast as a reward function for the generator.
 Such contests are modelled in the economic literature as all-pay auctions (Vojnović, 2015), where players simultaneously bid for a fixed prize; the highest bidder receives the prize, and every player, including non-winners, pay their bid.
In this paper, we propose a multi-class and multi-instance segmentation approach that we split into three relevant tasks: detection, separation and segmentation (cf. Figure 1).
Deep extreme multi-label learning: The objective in deep extreme multi-label learning is to learn feature representations and classifiers to automatically tag data points with the most relevant subset of labels from an extremely large label set.
 An example is machine translation, in which most words are generated in the target language, but rare elements such as names are copied from the input.
Santurkar et al., (2018) argued that batch normalization helps primarily because it improves the conditioning of the loss landscape, enabling stable training with larger learning rates.
 The first methods found in the literature for CPD compared probability distributions between two consecutive intervals in a time-series, and alarmed if the difference became significant.
A classic example of successful unsupervised learning of rich representations is word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) where the authors showed that distributed vector representations of words could be learned by contrastively predicting the neighboring words given surrounding words.
 Most of the pixels in an image taken from an onboard camera will be in distribution (ID), i.g,an image of a road scene with cars, people, and roadway—but an unusual object that was not part of the training set may cause only a small number of OOD pixels.
 In data centers, it probably indicates an attempt of cyber intrusion.
 Our method is particularly well-suited to solve sequential decisionmaking tasks with sparse terminal rewards, i.g,, rewards received at the end of a successful interaction with the environment.
 The iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA) (Daubechies et al., 2004) solves (1) by iterating over h(l)t = φλc (h(l−1) t −1 cD TAT(ADh (l−1) t − xt)), where l is the iteration counter, φγ(u) = sign(u)0, |u| − γ+ is the soft-thresholding operator, γ = λc , and c is an upper bound on the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of 12‖xt −ADht‖ 2 2.
 Structured representations like steerable filtering (Freeman & Adelson, 1991; Simoncelli & Freeman, 1995; Jacobsen et al., 2016), scattering (Bruna & Mallat, 2013; Sifre & Mallat, 2013), and steerable networks (Cohen & Welling, 2017) are efficient but constrained to the chosen structures.
In this work, focusing on image classification, we revisit active deep learning with the seminal idea of using all data, whether labeled or not, during model training at each active learning cycle.
 Despite its effectiveness, the process of error analysis usually requires manual examination and depends on some pre-existing assumptions, suffering from confirmation bias, and risking ignoring new types of errors (Neubig et al., 2019).
 The expanded lines may change the mobility trend of city population.
 Voice Conversion (VC) technique converts source speaker’s voice in such a way as if it were spoken by the target speaker.
 The performance of these methods relies heavily on the preconditioning – the task of choosing the hyperparameter called the preconditioner.
 In contrast, we investigate the case where each example is associated with not just one, but an entire subset of classes from a universe S.
Usually, ZSL is accomplished by preparing pre-defined semantic representations of all classes, such as attributes, and learning the relation between images and the class-attributes (relation-based approach).
 In particular, exploiting reduced numerical precision for data representations through quantization has been emphatically promising, whereby on customizable hardware, efficiency scales quadratically with each bit of precision.
 For example, the transportation of data for machine learning is a key factor in the design of modern data centers (Hazelwood et al., 2018), which are expected to be serviced by slow, yet high capacity, storage media for the foreseeable future (David Reinsel, 2018; Cheng et al., 2015; Rosenthal et al., 2012).
 (2)Relaxing the intractable rank penalty to its convex envelope, namely the nuclear norm, leads to a convex problem whose solution coincides with (2) under some technical conditions (Candès & Recht, 2009).
Approaches for improving robustness of a DNN to pixel perturbation can be broadly divided into two complementary categories.
 Zaheer et al., (2017) provide a proof that any function on sets can be modeled this way, by encoding sets as base-4 fractions and using the universal function approximation theorem, but their actual proposed model is far simpler than the model constructed by the theorem.
 Distilled from this example, we note there is a trade-off between how “well” a student studied, i.g,, how indifferent the student is to receiving exercise or test questions, and how close the test questions are to the exercise questions.
 Therefore, resorting to flexible parameter sharing becomes very important.
In this article, we propose a model of this sort.
 However, most prior methods in NPR are engineered for a specific application or task, and cannot easily adapt to new styles or medium.
 While most of the developed approaches (Khan & Madden, 2014) require a substantial amount of normal data to yield good generalization, in many real-world applications, e.g, in industrial manufacturing, only small datasets are available.
In high-D low-N settings, researchers have had success with transfer learning techniques, by leveraging additional data to learn intermediate representations that are then used in the target task.
 However, nothing guarantees that such classifiers perform satisfactorily on the tails of the explanatory variables, i.g,in regions attached to rare events or even outside the domain of observed data.
 For irregularly spaced sequences, a good starting point is the Hawkes process, a self-exciting temporal point process; many variations and enhancements have been published, including neural variants using LSTMs.
 Of particular interest is the work of Sotoudeh & Thakur (2019) which shows that if the inputs of a network are restricted to a line segment, the verification problem can sometimes be efficiently solved exactly.
 Data-parallel SGD, in particular, has received significant attention due to its excellent scalability properties (Zinkevich et al., 2010; Bekkerman et al., 2011; Recht et al., 2011; Dean et al., 2012; Coates et al., 2013; Chilimbi et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014; Duchi et al., 2015; Xing et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Alistarh et al., 2017).
The study of infinite networks dates back to seminal work by Neal (1994) who showed that the distribution of functions given by single hidden-layer networks with random weights and biases in the infinite-width limit are Gaussian Processes (GPs).
 Other text-based approaches use the hidden state vector of LSTM networks (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) that learn useful information while performing sequence-to-sequence learning tasks (Sutskever et al., 2014), such as machine translation (Wu et al., 2016), or surrounding sentence reconstruction (Kiros et al., 2015).
Orthogonal RNNs are a class of recurrent architectures that solve the vanishing gradient problem by constraining the recurrent connections to be an orthogonal or unitary matrix (Arjovsky et al., 2015).
This susceptibility of DNNs to adversarial perturbations has led to a large volume of work that attempts to design robust networks (Dhillon et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2019; Samangouei et al., 2018; Song et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2017).
 They are stated to be as expressive as WL in isomorphism tests, rendering strong competitors to WL graph kernels (Shervashidze et al., 2011) inspired by the same procedure.
This principle is also applicable to the computation systems for natural language.
 Another more recent approach has been to apply persistent homology to characterise expressivity (Guss & Salakhutdinov (2018)), while Poole et al., (2016) focus on global curvature, and the ability of deep networks to disentangle manifolds.
 Metrics like PSNR and SSIM (Wang et al., 2004) are often used (Dong et al., 2014; Tong et al., 2017) to approximate human-perceived similarity between the processed images with the original images, and direct human assessment on the fidelity of the output is often considered the \\u201cgold-standard\\u201d assessment (Ledig et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018b).
 Approaches range from simple interpolation to sophisticated data assimilation methods.
 This idea goes back to the foundational work of Hinton et al., (2015), itself inspired by earlier ideas developed by Bucilu et al., (2006).
 In order to overcome this problem, scheduled sampling (Bengio et al., 2015) and professor forcing (Lamb et al., 2016) are proposed, but scheduled sampling is proven to be fundamentally inconsistent (Huszár, 2015) and professor forcing use an adversarial method similar to GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014).
 This led, for example, to strong AI systems like Silver et al., (2017; 2018) or more recently to Lowrey et al., (2018), which is closely related to our work.
 Generating unrestricted perturbations with semantically meaningful patterns is an important yet under-explored field.
There is a recent trend of hybrid methods of MCMC and VI to achieve a better balance between computational efficiency and bias.
 This way of conceptualizing parallel viewpoints naturally leads to the formulation of a fully generative model over each instance, where the transformation corresponds to a particular generation of the underlying view.
 To obtain a representation of a specific node in a GNN, the node aggregates representations of its neighbors with a convolutional filter.
 While removing an input feature to measure its attribution is a principle method in causal reasoning, the existing removal (i.g, perturbation) techniques often produce out-of-distribution images (fig.  1b,d) i.g,a type of adversarial example, which (1) we found to produce heatmaps that are sensitive to hyperparameter settings; and (2) questions the correctness of the heatmaps (Adebayo et al., 2018).
 Few-shot learning methods require only a few examples from each task to be able to quickly adapt and perform well on a new task.
 Instead, the neurons are parameterized through weights which are optimized independently for every neuron in every layer.
 SIDS is not necessarily undesirable: consider an algorithm meant to alert drivers of imminent collisions.
 Factorization Machines (FMs) was introduced byRendle (2010) to model such high-dimensional sparse data.
Researchers in recent years have attempted to deal with the challenge by providing an agent with exploration bonuses (also known as “intrinsic rewards”) to encourage an agent to explore even when the reward signals from environments are sparse.
 This requires a model to learn the mapping of correspondences (alignment) between the visual and natural language modalities.
 Choosing an appropriate training objective is an open problem, but a promising guiding principle has emerged recently: good representations should make the spatio-temporal variability in natural signals more predictable.
 While QM simulations can be less time consuming than physical experimentation, they typically require large amounts of computing resources and do not scale well to larger system sizes (Jiang et al., 2003; Erba et al., 2017).
 The setting which we analyze is presented in Figure 1.
 Although the performance of knowledge graphlink prediction models has steadily improved for nearly a decade, relatively little is understood of the low-rank latent structure that underpins these models, which we address in this work.
 In particular, for some applications such as medical imaging, the annotation is limited by the available resources of expert analysts and data protection issues, which makes it even more challenging for curating large datasets.
However, in many complicated scenarios when the traffic flow changes frequently, the mathematical description of the obstacles are difficult to obtain explicitly.
One of the promising areas of research to address this growing compute gap is to reduce the numeric precision requirements for deep learning.
 This lead to a successful application of ES in variety of different RL settings (5; 6; 7; 8).
 In many deployed deep learning systems, the output is freely available, but the network used to generate that output is not disclosed.
 Popular approaches to imitation, such as Dynamic Motor Primitives (DMPs) (Ijspeert et al., 2013) or Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) (Calinon, 2009) largely focus on motion as the sole input and output modality, i.g,, joint angles, forces or positions.
 Consequently, the ill-posedness of (1) prohibits a direct solution of x by inverting A.
 However, it is questionable if these intrinsic graph-structures are optimal for the supervised downstream tasks.
However, in practice, since the adapted networks are often overfitted to the provided source data or the data distribution of the target domain is frequently quite different from the source, they do not perform well to the target domain.
 There has been substantial recent work on certifying robustness of computer vision models (Katz et al., 2017; Ehlers, 2017; Bunel et al., 2018; Ruan et al., 2018; Tjeng et al., 2019; Anderson et al., 2018; Wong et al., 2018; Dvijotham et al., 2018; Raghunathan et al., 2018; Dvijotham et al., 2019; Weng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Salman et al., 2019; Gehr et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2018; 2019a; Wang et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2019b).
 The basic idea behind smoothing is to sample many possible perturbations of the input, classify each of them, and use the aggregate information to make a final robust classification.
 Moreover, BNN can achieve high performance in a variety of fields, e.g, image recognition (Kendall et al., 2015; Kendall & Gal, 2017), language modeling (Fortunato et al., 2017), reinforcement learning (Kahn et al., 2017; Osband et al., 2018), meta-learning (Yoon et al., 2018; Finn et al., 2018), and multi-task learning (Kendall et al., 2018), by exploiting uncertainty.
 This property of neural network landscapes is called weight-space symmetry.
 As can be seen in Figure 1(a), KT is a method to improve the performance of a light student network by absorbing the knowledge from a strong teacher network.
The most direct strategy of robustification, called adversarial training, aims to harden a machine learning model by immunizing it against an adversary that maliciously corrupts training examples before passing them to the model (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Kurakin et al., 2016; Miyato et al., 2015; 2017; Madry et al., 2017).
 These works have shown that, with an appropriate design of the generator and discriminator, the global optimum of the WGAN objective identifies the target distribution with low sample complexity.
Local vs Global Views: Though word embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) and topics are complementary in how they represent the meaning, they are distinctive in how they learn from word occurrences observed in text corpora.
 In natural language processing, for example, the Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) uses dropout. and the recently popular BERT model (Devlin et al., 2018) uses L2 regularization.
 First, they require huge amounts of annotated data.
 In these approaches, each of them has a regularization term to constrain the update of some parameters that are important for previous tasks.
 Diverse skills can be autonomously acquired without extrinsic reward by maximizing an information theoretic objective using a maximum entropy policy (DIAYN (Eysenbach et al., (2018)); VIC (Gregor et al., (2016)); DAS (Sharma et al., (2019))).
 Consider a question “What number follows the sequence 1-2-1-4-1-6-1?” (Barrett et al., 2018; Saxton et al., 2019).
 Often though, these measurements cannot be performed densely due to missing sensors, under-sampled domains or occluded and unreachable areas.
It is more common to use low-bit quantized networks such as Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) (Courbariaux et al., 2016) to implement such deep neural networks on edge devices such as cell phones, smart wearables, etc.
 As a result, it becomes difficult to deploy these large-scale language representations into real-life computation constrained devices including mobile phones and edge devices.
 These can be considered as units on which we can build a modular model.
 Existing frameworks (Chen et al., 2015; Xing et al., 2015; Moritz et al., 2015; Abadi et al., 2015; Akiba et al., 2017; Paszke et al., 2017; Sergeev & Del Balso, 2018) all require high-end network infrastructure such as 25Gbps Ethernet or Infiniband where bandwidth is as large as 10 to 100 Gbps and latency is as small as 1 us.16x4 = 64 cards, batch size 32latency(ms) speed SSGD DTS ECD-PSGD ASGD FedAvg 0 151 0.79 0.7935 0.79941 141 0.73 0.7907 0.78295 130 0.68 0.7878 0.767710 119 0.62 0.7816 0.7607 50 62.2 0.32 0.7866 0.70 0.68 0.7441 100 34.2 0.18 0.7853 0.7370 500 7.46 0.04 0.7812 0.5179 1000 3.73 0.02 0.7721 0.376416x4 = 64 cards, batch size 32-1latency(ms) spee SSGD DTS ECD-PSGD 0 151 0.79 0.79351 141 0.73 0.7907 5 130 0.68 0.7878 10 119 0.62 0.7816 50 62.2 0.32 0.7866 0.70 100 34.2 0.18 0.7853 500 7.46 0.04 0.7812 1000 3.73 0.02 0.7721Sc alab ility0.023045068090Network Latency (ms) 0 1 5 10 50 100 500 1000SSGDBandwidth is easy to increase (e.g, stacking hardware) but latency is hard to improve (physical limits).
 In such scenarios, the decoding process starts before the entire input sequence is available, and the output sequence is produced in an on-the-fly manner.
Instability and mode collapse: GANs constitute the state of the art (SOTA) on many problems, but suffer from a variety of issues such as instability and mode collapse, i.g,a drastic loss of sample diversity, during training.
For the across-layer behavior, we study the learning process by measuring theW-distance between the distribution of any layer and the target distribution.
 Take the orange ball that is falling on the blue wedge in Figure 1.
 A major class of methods (Yang et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017) is devoted to learning efficient node representations of an attributed graph via nonnegative matrix factorization or random walk statistics and then perform downstream learning tasks with the learned representations.
 Even though the goal of such various model interpretability tasks varies, vast majority of them are built upon extracting relevant features for a prediction, so called feature-based explanation.
 They can also operate in a fully unsupervised way.
 As generative models are becoming more and more ubiquitous due to the massive progress in this area in recent years, it is of fundamental importance to understand these phenomena.
 Therefore training the network towards a new objective can cause almost complete forgetting of former knowledge.
While (1) and (2) are different in content, they share a similar structure, the corresponding words in them, while unrelated in meaning,2 serve the same function.
Among many attempts to establish implicit bias, Rahaman et al., (2018) pointed out an intriguing phenomenon called spectral bias, which says that during training, neural networks tend to learn the components of lower complexity faster.
 Despite its simplicity, SGD works very well, even in the non-convex non-smooth deep learning problems (He et al., 2016; Vaswani et al., 2017).
Lossy compression codecs usually perform a lossy transformation on the continuous representation of the data, after which it is mapped to a discrete domain through an operation known as quantization, such that entropy coding may be used to encode this transformed representation.
 Understanding why these networks generalize so well has been the subject of great interest in recent years.
Although reinforcement learning, especially deep RL (DRL), has recently attracted much attention and achieved significant performance in a variety of applications, such as game playing (Mnih et al., 2015; Silver et al., 2016) and robot navigation (Zhang et al., 2016), exploration techniques in RL are far from satisfactory in many cases.
 Just like in this scenario, our tasks often involve making selections from novel or unseen entities.
 We illustrate this for molecular hydration free energies in Figure 1 using the dataset of 12 where there is a distribution of noise values and in general the noise function might be expected to grow in proportion to chemical complexity 13.
 Next, graph filters are approximated with various finite order polynomials, e.g, Chebyshev polynomials (i.g,, the ChebNet model family of Defferrard et al., 2016; Kipf & Welling, 2017), Cayley transform (i.g,, CayleyNet of Levie et al., 2018) or the generalization of polynomial filters in a form of Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) models (Bianchi et al., 2019).
Our aim is to develop and leverage i) machine learning and estimation approaches to create selflabels for unlabelled instances, and ii) a noise-resistant learning procedure to speed up the performance of the seminal AdaBoost algorithm.
 On the other hand, model-based approaches can achieve low sample complexity by first learning a model for the environment.
 In addition, effective targeted attacks have not been achieved by current attacks for any task.
 Existing approaches to uncertainty estimation are roughlysplit into two categories: (1) learning aleatoric uncertainty (uncertainty in the data) and (2) epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty in the prediction).
 In particular, IMGEP selects interesting states from the experience buffer as goals for a goal-conditioned exploration policy.
 (2)The first term DKLqf (z|x)||p(z) constrains the encoded latent codes to the prior via the KLdivergence, and the second term Eqlog pg(x|z) serves to guarantee the reconstruction accuracy of inputs.
(1) Different data samples may have different task dependency.
 In this paper, we study and propose solutions for practical problems that arise while applying uDA techniques in ML systems, namely the challenges of distributed domain datasets and the overly centralized nature of existing uDA approaches.
 In particular, previous works (Feng et al., 2018; Ribeiro et al., 2018a; Sugawara et al., 2018) show that even after deletion of all but a small fraction of input words, models often produce the same output.
NLP transfer learning methods look like a promising solution to both of the challenges mentioned above, and are the focus of this paper.
 Recent availability of highthroughput experimental data and machine-learning based computational methods can be useful for unveiling and understanding such patterns.
 The example is taken from the XNLI dataset (Conneau et al., 2018), which was created for testing crosslingual NLI and includes labelled English sentence pairs, translated into 15 languages; manually for the development and test sets, automatically for the training set.
 An advantage of this framework is to explicitly decouple the problem of finding low-dimensional representations suitable for optimization from the actual optimization technique.
Despite their practical effectiveness, however, the exact nature of such curvature-corrected learning process remains largely unknown.
 Majority of ICD codes only have a few or no labeled data due to the rareness of the disease.
 A variety of energy forms, including Markovian priors (12), patch-based priors (20), gradient norms in variational and/or PDE-based formulations (4), Gaussian priors () as well as dynamical priors in fluid dynamics (3).
 This property is desirable because training and maintaining multiple models is more cumbersome than training and maintaining one model.
 However, SGD’s scalability is limited by its inherent sequential nature.
 Hence, limiting the influence of label noise is of great practical importance.
 Specifically, attention-based Seq2Seq models (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015) and their enhanced versions with copy (Vinyals et al., 2015; Gu et al., 2016) and coverage (Tu et al., 2016) mechanisms have been widely applied and show promising results on this task (Du et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018a; Kumar et al., 2018a).
 In particular, in MTRL an agent can be trained on multiple tasks in the samedomain, e.g, riding a bicycle or cycling while going towards a goal, or on different but similar domains, e.g, balancing a pendulum or balancing a double pendulum1.
We present the following contributions.
 However, these trivial global pooling operations may lose important features and ignore structural information.
 All these methods are based on deterministic optimization, which are conditioned with pre-defined affinity matrix and no learning paradigm is involved.
 With the progress of deep learning on grid-shaped images/videos (He et al., 2016), a few of graph convolutional neural networks (CNN) based methods, including spectral (Kipf & Welling, 2017) and spatial methods (Niepert et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018), have been proposed to learn local convolution filters on graphs in order to extract more discriminative node representations.
 The problem with BC is that, when the agent drifts and encounters out-of-distribution states, the agent does not know how to return to the demonstrated states.
 In particular, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no universal DNN approach that was shown to systematically outperform the leading GBDT packages (e.g, XGBoost (Chen & Guestrin, 2016)).
State-of-the-art UDA methods (Song et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019b; Yang et al., 2019) for person re-ID group unannotated images with clustering algorithms and train the network with clusteringgenerated pseudo labels.
 Thousands of new products are introduced in stores every week, and it would be very expensive to annotate them all.
 The agent updates with the maximum over action values might be large because an action’s value actually is high, or it can be misleadingly high simply because of the stochasticity or errors in the estimator.
 For example, one device may take photos mostly indoors, while another mostly outdoors.
 Therefore it is widely used in DNN pruning: Liu et al., (2015) directly apply `1 regularization to all the weights of a DNN to achieve element-wise sparsity; Wen et al., (2016; 2017) present structural sparsity via group lasso, which applies an `1 regularization over the `2 norms of different groups of parameters.
In this paper, we therefore propose to investigate the search phase of existing NAS algorithms in a controlled manner.
 To capture all modes of a data distribution, variational autoencoders (VAEs) are well-suited generative models.
 Therefore SGD generally moves along the descent direction, see Bertsekas & Tsitsiklis (2000).
In this paper, we focus on lifelong language learning, where a machine achieves lifelong learning on a stream of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
 †Co-corresponding authors.
Spatial approaches execute “convolution” directly on the graph and operate on the neighborhood as defined by the graph topology.
However, confidence estimation (also referred as ‘confidence calibration’) is still a challenging problem for DNNs.
 Given a positive semi-definite kernel function κ : A × A → R, the probability of a discrete point set X ⊂ A under a DPP with kernel function κ can be characterized as:Pκ(X ) ∝ det(LX ) (1) where L is a |X | × |X | matrix with entry Lij = κ(xi,xj) and xi,xj ∈ X . L is called L-ensemble.
On the other hand, the M4 competition winner (Smyl, 2020), was based on a hybrid between neural residual/attention dilated LSTM stack with a classical Holt-Winters statistical model (Holt, 1957; 2004; Winters, 1960) with learnable parameters.
The key challenge to deal with task heterogeneity is how to customize globally shared meta-learner by using task-specific information? Recently, a handful of works try to solve the problem by learning a task-specific representation for tailoring the transferred knowledge to each task (Oreshkin et al., 2018; Vuorio et al., 2018; Lee & Choi, 2018).
 On the other hand, extensive work (Meng & Wong, 1996; Neal, 2001; Hinton, 2002; Tieleman, 2008; Wainwright et al., 2005; Wainwright & Jordan, 2006) has been done to estimate the partition function.
Several categories of approaches are proposed to decrease the computational overhead of neural networks, such as lightweight neural network architectures (Howard et al., 2017), neural architecture search (NAS) (Elsken et al., 2018), and network pruning (Han et al., 2015; 2016; Wen et al., 2016;∗Corresponding authorMolchanov et al., 2017).
 There are three types of supervision in weakly supervised learning: incomplete, inexact and inaccurate supervision.
 Yet, when the model should adapt to a large number of tasks, the interference between task-specific knowledge is inevitable with fixed network capacity.
 A compromise must be found between adapting to new tasks and enforcing stability to preserve knowledge from previous tasks.
One perspective on adversarial attacks is that adversarial noise is a direction in which to \\u201cmove\\u201d the natural data.
 The learning based methods are trained on a huge number of problem instances, and have been shown to be extremely fast in producing solutions of reasonably good quality.
 Cross-encoders (Wolf et al., 2019; Vig & Ramea, 2019), which perform full (cross) self-attention over a given input and label candidate, tend to attain much higher accuracies than their counterparts, Bi-encoders (Mazare\\u0301 et al., 2018; Dinan et al., 2019), which perform self-attention over the input and candidate label separately and combine them at the end for a final representation.
 Recent works (Zeng et al., 2019; Choukroun et al., 2019b; Zhang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Krishnamoorthi, 2018; Sasaki et al., 2019) find that various weight kernels of a∗This work was supported in part by NSF CCF-1908992 and CCF-1909509.0 0.5-0.5250 C ou nt00250C ount-0.25 0 0.250250 C ou nt0.0 0.50250C ou ntmean=-0.012 std=0.127mean=-0.052 std=0.198mean=-0.022 std=0.126mean=0.070 std=0.200outliersoutliers -1Figure 1: The weight distribution of kernels.convolutional layer (ResNet-18) exhibit different variances shown in Figure 1 and hence have different amounts of redundancy.
 Tremendous efforts have been exerted to develop efficient and effective NAS algorithms (Liu et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2019b; Luo et al., 2018; Akimoto et al., 2019; Nayman et al., 2019).
 However, in many reinforcement learning tasks, it is not possible for the agent to acquire the underlying transition function, making such algorithms inapplicable.
On the other hand, off-policy methods, such as one-step Q-learning (Watkins & Dayan, 1992) and variants of deep Q networks (DQN) (Mnih et al., 2015; Hessel et al., 2017; Dabney et al., 2018; Van Hasselt et al., 2016; Schaul et al., 2015), enjoys the advantage of learning from any trajectory sampled from the same environment (i.g,, off-policy learning), are currently among the most sampleefficient algorithms.
 MI measures the amount of information obtained about a random variable X by observing some other random variable Y 1 Formally, the MI between X and Y , with joint density p(x, y) and marginal densities p(x) and p(y), is defined as the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between the joint and the product of the marginalsI(X;Y ) = DKL (p(x, y) ‖ p(x)p(y)) = Ep(x,y)  log p(x, y)p(x)p(y) .
 On the theoretical side, previous work do not provide analysis for the case when the underlying MDP is relatively complex and requires the policy to be a non-linear function approximator such as a neural network.
Stochastic transformation-based defenses have shown considerable success in recovering from adversarial attacks.
 The clipping operation sets a full precision number to the range boundary if it is outside of the range; the projection operation maps each number (after clipping) into a predefined quantization level (a fixed number).
 CFR (Zinkevich et al., 2008) further bounds the original regret with a summation of many immediate counterfactual regrets on each information set (infoset).
 This research focuses on the consistency of “knowledge” between two DNNs, instead of comparing the similarity of “features.” In comparison, the feature is referred to as the explicit output of a layer.
 Static diffuse textures are frequently reconstructed for novel viewpoint synthesis, but these textures lack view-dependent appearance effects.
 These problems have been previously addressed using a variety of techniques including logic rules, knowledge bases, and neural networks.
 However, implementing and running MAML continues to be challenging.
Current MANNs miss a key concept in computer design: stored-program memory.
 In this work, we aim to develop a method that can start to address these challenges, leveraging self-supervised models learned using only unlabeled data, to solve novel temporally-extended tasks.
 However, MARL introduces new challenges in model training and execution, due to non-stationarity and partial observability in a decentralized MDP from the viewpoint of each agent.
 While there has been recent progress on learning such functions (Zaheer et al., 2017; Qi et al., 2017), they compress a set of any size down to a single feature vector in one step.
 Specifically, we focus on extracting constituency trees from pre-trained LMs without fine-tuning or introducing another task-specific module, at least one of which is usually required in other cases where representations from pre-trained LMs are employed.
 Existing models can be categorized into embedding-based and path-based model families.
 These attempts include performing local linear transformation like adding Gaussian noise (Tabacof & Valle, 2016), where the processed inputs are kept nearby the original ones, such that the classifiers can maintain high performance on the clean inputs.
 Examples of constraints include forcing the variational posterior q(z|x) to be similar to a factorial p(z) (Burgess et al., 2018; Higgins et al., 2017a), forcing the variational aggregated prior q(z) to be similar to the prior p(z) (Makhzani et al., 2015), adding total correlation loss (Kim & Mnih, 2018), forcing the covariance matrix of q(z) to be close to the identity matrix (Kumar et al., 2017), and using a kernel-based measure of independence (Lopez et al., 2018).
In contrast, state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) methods often fail to capture the compositional structure that is underlying the problem domain and thus fail to generalize compositionally (Lake & Baroni, 2018; Bastings et al., 2018; Loula et al., 2018; Russin et al., 2019; Johnson et al., 2017).
 While these methods are exciting, the verification process is often slow and not scalable.
 This would suggest that while the hypothesis space itself is extremely complex, our search strategy favors the simplest solutions and thus generalizes.
 This variational approach parameterizes the information bottleneck model using a neural network (i.g,, an encoder).
 Since then, the notion of an arrow of time has been formalized and explored in various contexts, spanning not only physics, but also algorithmic information theory (Zurek, 1989), causal inference (Janzing et al., 2016) and time-series analysis (Janzing, 2010; Bauer et al., 2016).
Among substantial works of adversarial training, there still remains a big robust generalization gap between the training data and the testing data (Schmidt et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019b; Ding et al., 2019; Zhai et al., 2019).
 This development has become possible due to the availability of larger training sets, computing resources, GPU training implementations, and better regularization techniques, such as Dropout (Hinton et al., (2012); Zeiler & Fergus (2014)).
 For the binary-treatment case, we denote the alternative treatment as ¬ti = 1− ti.
 However, the existing methods either lack a principled way of constraining the number of discovered options (e.g, Machado and Bowling, 2016; Machado et al., 2017; 2018) or are limited to the tabular setting (e.g, Jinnai et al., 2019b).
 2) GANs suffer from mode collapse, in which the generator only learns to generate few modes of data distribution while missing others, although samples from the missing modes occur throughout the training data (see e.g, Goodfellow (2016)).
 However, the real world has structure beyond entities and their direct relationships: for example, the three blocks in Figure 1 are arranged in such a way that if either of the supporting blocks is removed, the top block will fall.
 For example, it may be difficult to discern from a single demonstration where to grasp an object when it is in a new position or how much force to apply in order to slide an object without knocking it over.
 To ensure high tracking accuracy and robustness against errors in object detection, in MOT only the detection results with sufficient consistency and stability across multiple frames can be included in the tracking results and actually influence the driving decisions.
Existing methods on learning with noisy labels (LNL) primarily take a loss correction approach.
 †Corresponding author.
 The modified algorithm, V-MPO, relies on a learned state-value function V (s) instead of the state-action value function used in MPO.
However, as shown in the previous literature (Dosovitskiy & Brox (2016); Zeiler & Fergus (2014); Mahendran & Vedaldi (2015); Shokri et al., (2017); Ganju et al., (2018); Melis et al., (2019)), intermediatelayer features face many privacy threats, where the adversary either reconstructs the input or infers unintended properties about the input.
 Among them, stochastic version of Nesterov’s acceleration method (SGD+Nesterov) is arguably the most widely used to train modern machine learning models in practice.
Early successes in self-supervision have encouraged authors to develop a large variety of pretext tasks, from colorization to rotation estimation and image autoencoding.
 As all these applications rely on the assumption that disentangled representations can be reliably learned in practice, we hope to learn them with as little supervision as possible (Bengio et al., 2013; Schölkopf et al., 2012; Peters et al., 2017; Pearl, 2009; Spirtes et al., 2000).
 Two examples of that are novelty detection from an unlabeled data set and next-frame prediction from video sequences.
 That is, the agent should account for variations in both by selectively reading, thereby generalising to environments with dynamics not seen during training.
Universality statements allow us to grasp the expressive power of models in the limit.
Incremental domain adaptation is useful in scenarios where data are proprietary, or available only for a short period of time (Li & Hoiem, 2018).
 In some cases self-play between agents as they improve can serve as a powerful automatic curriculum for achieving expert or superhuman performance (Silver et al., 2018; Vinyals et al., 2019).
 From this perspective, we analyze the identifiability of attention weights, what we call attention identifiability, in the self-attention components of transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), one of the most popular neural architectures for language encoding and decoding.
With the success of deep learning, a few recent works have proposed to learn neural network-based dynamics models for MBRL.
 The value function learned from the demonstrations can also extrapolate falsely to unseen states.
 In contrast, in this work we focus on TD learning directly and examine its behavior under generic function approximation.
 The challenge, however, is the degree of transferability of the underlying representation learned across different classes.
 The success of momentum makes it a necessary tool for designing new optimization algorithms in optimization and deep learning.
 In domains such as these, an attacker cannot usually directly modify the victim policy’s input.
 For example, a predictive generative model that can predict future frames in a video would need to model complex real-world phenomena, such as physical interactions.
 These ‘controversial’ empirical findings motivate theoretical analysis to understand the fundamental performance factors and the architecture design choices for GCNs.
 These results suggest that large-scale pretrained models implicitly capture real-world knowledge.
Since mistakes are inevitable, deep learning practitioners should be able to adjust model behavior by correcting errors as they appear.
 In this work, we focus on two representative tasks: address prefetching (modeling data-flow during execution) (Jouppi, 1990; Wenisch et al., 2009; Hashemi et al., 2018) and branch prediction (modeling control-flow during execution) (Jiménez & Lin, 2001; Seznec, 2011; Smith, 1981)1.
 Auto-DeepLab (Liu et al., 2019a) first introduced network-level search space to optimize resolutions (in addition to cell structure) for segmentation tasks.
 However, the aforementioned methods only focus on producing specific types of unseen data, instead of enabling the generation of general types of unseen data.
 Statistically, AUC (short for Area Under the ROC curve) is defined as the probability that the prediction score of a positive example is higher than that of a negative example (Hanley & McNeil, 1982; 1983) .
 During training, these methods first learn on-the-fly adversarial examples of the inputs with multiple attack iterations and then update model parameters using these perturbed samples together with the original labels.
The cycle of attacks and defenses motivates us to rethink both how we can improve the general robustness of neural networks as well as the high-level motivation for this pursuit.
 Alternatively, a large body of work has focused ondetection of adversarial examples (Bhagoji et al., 2017; Feinman et al., 2017; Gong et al., 2017; Grosse et al., 2017; Metzen et al., 2017; Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2017; Li & Li, 2017; Xu et al., 2017; Pang et al., 2018; Roth et al., 2019; Bahat et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2018; Zheng & Hong, 2018; Tian et al., 2018).
For solving such PO tasks, several categories of methods have been proposed.
One of the advantages of using a population is the capability to evaluate policies in the population.
 During this process, the agents build mappings between the concepts they wish to communicate about and the symbols used to represent them.
 The attacker can then apply the white-box attack techniques with the approximated gradient (Chen et al., 2017; Ilyas et al., 2018a; Tu et al., 2018).
 Third, rank the competing classifiers according to their goodness of fit (e.g, accuracy) on the test set; the one with the best result is declared the winner.
 We provide a theoretical understanding of dropout and its variants, such as Gaussian dropout (Wang & Manning, 2013), variational dropout (Kingma et al., 2015), and dropconnect (Wan et al., 2013), as an adaptive L2-penalty toward the origin (all zero parameters 0) and generalize dropout by considering a target model parameter u (instead of the origin), to which we refer as mixout(u).
 The algorithm needs to learn the transition dynamics of MDP, while aiming to maximize the cumulative reward.
 This paper addresses this question by showing that one can reduce the learning to a single dictionary matrix, which is used to compute a positive sparse `1 code.
 Following this observation, many approaches tocompress existing models have been proposed (see Gale et al., (2019) for a recent review on network sparsification, and Mozer & Smolensky (1989); Srivastava et al., (2014); Yu et al., (2018); He et al., (2017) for neural pruning).
 In fact, in a shallow network with ReLU activation functions, it is easy to construct training sets whose empirical loss landscape has high plateaus.
On the other hand, adversarial examples are widely employed to fool the classifier, and training classifiers against adversarial attacks has shown effectiveness in detecting unknown adversarial attacks (Tramer et al., 2018).
 Our results demonstrate that the impact of nonlinearities is profound.
 To develop deep SSMs for multi-object systems, graph neural networks (GNNs) emerge to be a promising choice, as they have been shown to be fundamental NN building blocks that can impose relational inductive bias explicitly and model complex interactions effectively (Battaglia et al., 2018).
 As this approach generally reduces the amount of inter-node communication, it may provide for considerably reduced training time.
 They also incorporate the idea of joint action learner (JAL) (Littman, 1994) to facilitate multiagent coordination.
 The input is a video, which contains one or more characters.
 During training, SAL rewards the generator when its currently generated samples are found to be better than its previously generated samples.
 Based on this, recent studies consider examples that incur small losses on the network that does not overfit noisy examples as being clean (Han et al., 2018; Shen & Sanghavi, 2019).
Recently, Khemakhem et al., (2019) introduced a theory of identifiability for deep generative models, based upon which the authors proposed an identifiable variant of VAEs called iVAE, to learn the distribution over latent variables in an identifiable manner.
 In particular, a robust classifier verifiably predicts the same top-1 label for data points in a certain region around any example x.
Despite taking inspiration from tabular algorithms, current model-free approaches to exploration in deep RL do not employ optimistic initialisation, which is crucial to provably efficient exploration in all model-free tabular algorithms.
 The task-specific model is directly finetuned for the specific target task, without any generic visual-linguistic pre-training.
 Though a convolution responds accordingly to each input, how it responds is primarily programmed by its rigid kernels, as in Figure 1(a, b).
 Crucially, ensemble approaches allow total uncertainty in predictions to be decomposed into knowledge uncertainty and data uncertainty.
 The major drawback of SSGD is that its speed is confined to the slowest worker in every iteration.
Such extrapolations are an integral part of human representational capabilities (consider common expressions such as ”like an elephant in a china shop”) and consistent with the modular organization of its visual system, comprising specialized regions encoding objects, faces and places (see e.g, GrillSpector & Malach (2004)).
 This allows us to to identify physical parameters and learn vision components of the model jointly in an end-to-end fashion.
The usual approach to enforcing the triangle inequality in deep metric learning (Yi et al., 2014; Hoffer and Ailon, 2015; Wang et al., 2018) is to use a Siamese network (Bromley et al., 1994) that computes a Euclidean distance in the latent space.
 Hence, exploring the limitations or improving the efficiency of such methods remains subject to trial and error.
 Within KBQA, a common approach is neural semantic parsing—i.g,, using neural methods to translate a natural-language question into a structured query against the KB (Zhong et al., 2017; Finegan-Dollak et al., 2018; Shaw et al., 2019), which is subsequently executed with a symbolic KB query engine.
 Existing approaches use stochastic search (Sharma & Aiken, 2016), heurstics-based search (Galeotti et al., 2015), PAC learning based on counterexamples (Padhi & Millstein, 2017), or reinforcement learning (Si et al., 2018).
 Comparison between published search algorithms for NAS is therefore either very difficult (complex training protocols with no code available) or simply impossible (different search spaces), as previously pointed out (Li & Talwalkar, 2019; Sciuto et al., 2019; Lindauer & Hutter, 2019).
 The self-supervised nature of video prediction aligns well with how humans learn, without requiring large amounts of labeled data.
 In learning to rank (LTR), the pairwise approach learns, between two documents, which one is more relevant to a query (Liu, 2009).
 However, existing reading comprehension datasets have none or merely a small amount of data requiring logical reasoning, e.g, 0% in MCTest dataset (Richardson et al., 2013) and 1.2% in SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) according to Sugawara & Aizawa (2016).
 The use of deep networks as universal function approximators has facilitated very rapid advancements which samples generated from these models often being indistinguishable from natural data.
 Since their introduction, VAEs have become one of the frameworks of choice among the different generative models.
 Chen et al., (2019) proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) framework for detection backbone to avoid expert efforts and design trails.
 However, little work has been so far done in analyzing RL networks.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (Micheli, 2009; Scarselli et al., 2008) have recently become the standard tool for machine learning on graphs.
 A number of recent theoretical analyses have shown that, for a large network initialized in this way, accurate models can be found by traveling a short distance in parameter space (see Du et al., 2019b;a; Allen-Zhu et al., 2019; Zou et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019).
 As a result, its regret bound is data-independent, and can not benefit from the structure of data.
 However, changes in the statistics of the data can also be real properties of the data-generating process.
We hypothesise that multiplicative interactions are suitable for representing certain meaningful classes of functions needed to build algorithmic operations such as conditional statements or similarity metrics, and more generally as an effective way of integrating contextual information in a network in a way that generalizes effectively.
 They studied the representational power of these GNNs and identified that most neighborhood aggregation and graph-pooling schemes had diminished discriminative power.
The Imitation Learning (IL, Argall et al., (2009); Abbeel & Ng (2004)) approach is a powerful and practical alternative to RL.
 Hence, the number of training parameters is considerably smaller than it is when training the entire model, which allows us to train the model quickly with a small dataset.
 To overcome the challenge, some recent work (Zhou et al., 2018b; Dinan et al., 2019) resorts to crowd-sourcing and builds benchmarks with the source of Wikipedia.
 Yet, there is still no concrete evidence that these models learn grammatical and constituency structures implicitly.
The “flat directions” are spanned by the small eigenvalues and the null-space (of dimension at least P − N when there is a single output).
 However, since the capacity of the joint state and action spaces grows exponentially in the number of agents, such MARL approaches become computationally intractable when the number of agents is large, which is common in real-world applications (Sandholm, 2010; Calderone, 2017; Wang et al., 2017a).
There are two main approaches to neural network analysis.
 MMD-nets are similar in spirit to generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Nowozin et al., 2016), in the sense that the MMD is defined by maximizing over a class of critic functions.
 This leads us to introduce the concept of a property, which is a program that computes a boolean function of the input and output of another program.
 In fact, in some cases, it could be difficult to identify an action correctly by only using partial observation.
 While skill chaining was capable of discovering skills in continuous state spaces, it could only be applied to relatively low-dimensional state-spaces with discrete actions.
 As a result, detection of photo manipulations online is notoriously unreliable.
 For example, when training typical Transformers based neural machine translation models on the De-En IWSLT\\u201914 dataset, removing the warmup stage increases the training loss from 3 to around 10, as shown in Figure 1.
∗Correspondence to kristian.
Many meta-learning methods use the episodic training setup in which the meta-learner iterates through episodes in the meta-training phase.
 We propose a novel approach, Global Interaction Detection and Encoding for Recommendation (GLIDER), which detects feature interactions that span globally across multiple data-instances from a source recommender model, then explicitly encodes the interactions in a target recommender model, both of which can be black-boxes.
In this paper, we discuss two limitations of variational approaches to MI estimation.
 Given the compositional nature of visual scenes, separating latent representations into object-centric ones can facilitate fast and robust learning (Watters et al., 2019a), while also being amenable to relational reasoning (Santoro et al., 2017).
 This is not only a theoretical concern because it is well-documented that GANs exhibit mode collapse (Che et al., 2016; Salimans et al., 2016) where the generator produces a subset of the ”modes” in the training data, reducing∗Authors contributed equally 1Code to reproduce experiments is available at github.
 While training using objectives like GAN loss Goodfellow et al., (2014), regularizations like L1 loss Isola et al., (2017) and perceptual loss Wang et al., (2018) are imposed to improve both visual fidelity and correspondence to the input condition.
 This quantization is defined by a mapping of real numbers to the set of discrete values supported by a given low precision representation (often integers with 8-bits or less).
 Generative models like GANs, in contrast, can create content from scratch, but we do not currently have tools for navigating the generated scenes in the same kind of way as you can walk through and interact with a 3D game engine.
 For example, annotation and quality control required more than 1.5h per image (on average) on Cityscapes (Cordts et al., 2016), a popular dataset used for benchmarking semantic segmentation methods.
 Attack algorithms under a more realistic, restrictive black-box threat model, which assumes access to predictions in lieu of gradients, are therefore studied.
 ∗Majority of the work was done while RV was at TU Kaiserslautern, Germany.
 Such planning efforts will become more and more crucial, because in the limit, it might not even be practical to visit every training example before running out of resources (Bottou, 1998; Rai et al., 2009).
Since accurate search in high dimensions is prohibitively expensive in practice (Wang, 2011), one has to typically sacrifice accuracy for efficiency by resorting to approximate methods.
Since each iteration of TD uses one or a mini-batch of samples to estimate the mean of the pseudogradient 1, TD learning usually suffers from the inherent variance, which substantially degrades the convergence accuracy.
 These methods interpret the states and actions provided in the expert demonstrations as a finite sample from a target distribution.
 At a high level, the MAML algorithm is comprised of two optimization loops.
 With high probability, if the classifier perfectly fits the training data, we obtain1Test classification error .
 Recent fixes involve modifying the decoding strategy using sampling or more sophisticated beam search variants.
There has been recent progress in applying stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB) (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014) to training probabilistic neural TTS models.
Underdetermination is just one form of extrapolation, but it is particularly relevant in the context of overparameterized model classes (e.g, deep neural networks).
A DNN can be possibly tampered by an adversary during different phases in its life cycle.
 Notably, information flows constantly between training tasks and the meta-learner as learning progresses; to make iterative updates, the meta-learner obtains feedback on the current φ by having task-specific models θ̄t trained with it.
 However, we believe that the commonly-used setup for measuring success in this direction is lacking.
 In extreme multi-label classification, q represents a web-page document and d represents the categories or hashtags of interests (Jain et al., 2019; Chang et al., 2019).
In contrast to IL, planning-based algorithms like model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) methods do not require expert demonstrations.
First, given that exploration is crucial for RL (Thrun, 1992) and even more so in MARL with larger state and joint action spaces, how should agents explore to learn both individual goal attainment and cooperation for others’ success? Uniform random exploration is common in deep MARL (Hernandez-Leal et al., 2018) but can be highly inefficient as the value of cooperative actions may be discoverable only in small regions of state space where cooperation is needed.
 Network architecture and functional units are often borrowed from the image-recognition literature, and it is unclear which of these aspects contributes to, or limits, the denoising performance.
 On the other hand, some more recent attacks have considered the probability black-box setting where the attacker does not know the victim model’s structure and weights, but can iteratively query the model and get the corresponding probability output.
 However, even with these innovations the optimizing compilation time can be around 10 hours for ResNet-18 (He et al., 2016), and even more for deeper or wider networks.
 Is the contextual bias of the orientation-tilt illusion a bug of biology or a byproduct of optimized neural computations?Over the past 50 years, there has been a number of neural circuit mechanisms proposed to explain individual contextual illusions (reviewed in Mély et al., 2018).
The fundamental question we wish to address in this work is: What are the principles that contribute to learning good representations for ZSL? While the most successful ZSL models (Atzmon & Chechik, 2019; Wang et al., 2019) use pretrained features from Imagenet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Russakovsky et al., 2015), we wish to understand how these features can emerge given only the data provided from the ZSL task.
One key ingredient in the training recipe for NAT models that is used in almost all existing works (Gu et al., (2018); Lee et al., (2018); Stern et al., (2019), inter alia) is creation of training data through knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015).
 Backdoor attack is a type of data poisoning attacks that aim to manipulate a subset of training data such that machine learning models trained on the tampered dataset will be vulnerable to the test set with similar trigger embedded (Gu et al., 2019).
 (3) Learning: The classic evidence lower bound (ELBO) learning objective for training BNNs is not amenable to backpropagation as the ELBO is not an explicit function of the output of probabilistic propagation.
Despite this, it has been challenging to improve normalization layers.
Such problems mentioned above are called zeroth-order (ZO) optimization problems, where the optimizer is only provided with function values (zeroth-order information) rather than explicit gradients (first-order information).
 The rollout workers are then distributed across, potentially, thousands of CPUs1.
 This approach takes as input a trained neural network fφ̂(y | x)—i.g,, whose parameters φ̂ have already been fit to a training dataset Ztrain—which produces unreliable probabilities fφ̂(y | x).
 Numerous studies have shown that full-precision floating-point computation is not necessary for DNN inference — quantized fixed-point models produce competitive results with a small or zero loss in prediction accuracy (Lin et al., 2016; He et al., 2016b; Zhou et al., 2016; 2017).
 Neural module networks (NMNs; Andreas et al., 2016) extend semantic parsers by making the program executor a learned function composed of neural network modules.
To this end, we propose an object representation that encodes an object as a function that maps points from a canonical space, such as the unit sphere, to the set of points defining the object.
To extract and relate semantic and visual concepts, we first introduce variational hetero-encoder (VHE) that encodes an image to decode its textual description (e.g, tags, sentences, binary attributes, and long documents), where the probabilistic encoder and decoder are jointly optimized using variational inference (Blei et al., 2017; Hoffman et al., 2013; Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014).
 Most of them usually do well in searching an architecture for single task but are troublesome for multiple datasets or multiple tasks.
 IF games are structured as puzzles and often consist of an complex, interconnected web of distinct locations, objects, and characters.
The recent advancements in generative models have enabled the successful dynamics estimation of high-dimensional decision processes (Watter et al., 2015; Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018; Kurutach et al., 2018).
 In almost all cases so far, ground-truth solutions are used to drive learning, giving the model complete freedom to find a mapping from raw inputs to such solution1.
 Quantization based methods (Tung & Mori, 2018; Park et al., 2017) may not substantially improve the execution time of CNNs, and many methods (Lebedev & Lempitsky, 2016; Zhang et al., 2018) have also been proposed to improve the inference speed of CNNs.
 A notable example of such graphs is knowledge graphs.
The typical motivation for learning a causal graphical model is to predict the effect of various interventions.
 This hypothesis is concerned with the dynamics of training neural networks using stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
 If no similarity is found, eventually, each example is put into its own leaf to achieve good training accuracy (but, of course, at the cost of poor generalization).
 This flexible recombination of single experiences in novel ways to infer unobserved relationships is called inferential reasoning and is supported by the hippocampus (Zeithamova et al., 2012).
 Fixed vocabulary models assume known slot ontology and generate a score for each candidate of (slot,value) (Ramadan et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019).
 Pascanu et al., (2013b) attributed this to the fact that the error gradient back-propagated in time (BPTT), for the time-step m, is dominated by product of partials of hiddenstate vectors, ∏T−1 j=m ∂hj+1 ∂hj, and these products typically exhibit exponentially vanishing decay or explosion, resulting in incorrect credit assignment during training and test-time.
 Here we perform a thorough investigation of the state of the network in this early stage.
 Directly computing batch statistics without any modification on each GPU will make performance of the model severely degrade.
 Another example is a recommendation system deployed on multiple servers to handle high demand.
There have been two main approaches for investigating ANN robustness: adversarial machine learning and training data manipulation (Ford et al., (2019)).
One important line of theoretical investigation of deep linear networks concerns optimization landscape analysis (Kawaguchi, 2016; Hardt & Ma, 2016; Freeman & Bruna, 2016; Lu & Kawaguchi, 2017; Yun et al., 2018; Zhou & Liang, 2018), where major findings include that any critical point of a deep linear network with square loss function is either a global minimum or a saddle point, and identifying conditions on the weight matrices that exclude saddle points.
 Our work follows this philosophy.
In this work, we revisit a much older and simpler semi-supervised method, self-training (ST, Scudder (1965)), where a base model trained with labeled data acts as a “teacher” to label the unannotated data, which is then used to augment the original small training set.
 Multi-output models in Lian et al., (2015) such as coregionalization and cokriging can outperform independent predictions.
 Specifically, we target TypeScript, a gradually-typed variant of Javascript for which plenty of training data is available in terms of type-annotated programs.
 Then the trained inference networks are transferred to the generation stage to pass the information about the speech, which helps the generation network to output the face image from the conditioned speech.
 Our ability to imagineinformation missing from the current image view\\u2014and necessary for predicting alternative views\\u2014 is tightly coupled with visual perception.
 The learned classification model tends to perform better on these classes, while performance is significantly worse for instance-scarce (or tail) classes.
 Perturbing the dynamics of the environment during test time, which may include executing the policy in a real-world setting, can have a significant negative impact on the performance of the agent (Andrychowicz et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2018; Derman et al., 2018; Di Castro et al., 2012; Mankowitz et al., 2018a).
Given a network of limited capacity, one way to address this problem is to identify the importance of each parameter and penalize further changes to those parameters that were deemed to be important for the previous tasks (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Aljundi et al., 2018; Zenke et al., 2017).
 Although many regularization techniques, such as adding regularization terms, data augmentation, weight decay, dropout and batch normalization, have been proposed, generalization is still vitally important for deep learning to fully exploit the super-expressive power.
 Often, a modeler’s first step would be to inspect individual examples in order to discover bugs, generate hypotheses, improve labeling, or similar.
 One of the consequence is that neural networks trained with different random seeds will usually not make all the same errors on the test set, i.g,they may disagree on a prediction given the same input even if the model has converged (Fort et al., 2019).
The idea of CHL is to propagate the target activities, instead of the errors, backward through the network.
However, in addition to such NTK-dependent parameters, prior work also requires the width to depend polynomially on n, 1/δ or 1/ , where n denotes the size of the training set, δ denotes the failure probability, and denotes the target error.
 Since Raissi et al., (2017a;b) use the coordinates as input and compute derivatives based on the coordinates to represent the equation, the setting is only valid when the data are densely observed over spatial and temporal space.
 Recently, zero-overhead bits back compression with a significantly simpler implementation has been developed by Townsend et al., (2019).
 Not only is the algorithm highly sample efficient, it can learn quickly, training 30 percent faster than IMPALA.
 It generally suffers from the exposure bias (Bengio et al., 2015; Ranzato et al., 2016) , which refers to the discrepancy between training and generation using the Teacher Forcing (Williams & Zipser, 1989) strategy, i.g,, during training ground truth tokens are used as inputs, while during generation, only generated tokens are available.
 In practice, this is enforced by Lipschitz constraints, which in turn motivated developments like gradient penalties (Gulrajani et al., 2017) and spectral normalization (Miyato et al., 2018).
 While the idea is natural, building a high-fidelity simulator could be extensively challenging in numerous domains, such as those that involve human interactions.
 Li et al., (2018) was the first to call attention to the oversmoothing problem.
 A simple such example is early stopping, which has been observed to be surprisingly effective for this purpose (Rolnick et al., 2017; Guan et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019).
 For example, Radford et al., (2015) observed on auto-encoders trained on datasets with labels for some factors of variations, that their latent spaces exhibit a vector space structure where some directions encode the said factors of variations.
In a variety of settings, especially in physical systems, wherein laws of physics are primarily responsible for shaping the outcome, generalization in neural networks can be improved by leveraging underlying physics for designing the computation graphs.
 Motivated by this practical significance, there has been a growing surge of interest recently (e.g, Rambhatla et al., (2019); Bai et al., (2018); Gilboa et al., (2018); Nguyen et al., (2018); Chatterji & Bartlett (2017); Mensch et al., (2016)) that aims to tackle SDL.
The problem can be modeled as event detection – i.g,, given the total energy consumed by the house as a function of time, we want to detect when various appliances are turned on.
Though powerful, NTK is not yet a completely satisfying theory for explaining the success of deep learning in practice.
 However the original CFR only works for discrete states and action spaces, and the resulting strategy is maintained as a tabular representation.
 Furthermore, while the model transfers better to languages similar to English, it still achieves reasonable accuracies even on languages with different scripts.
 This contrasts strongly with visual classification tasks, in which deep models merely map from images to labels.
Existing methods Several approaches have provided ways to address the above challenge, including using an external model that learns to rank candidate programs returned by the synthesizer, modifying the search procedure by learning to guide the synthesizer such that it returns more likely programs directly, or neural program induction methods that replace the synthesizer with a neural network to generate outputs directly using a latent program representation.
 However, learning their parameters can be computationally intensive.
 In (Breiman, 2001), the upper bound of the generalization error of random forests is expressed in terms of strength and correlation.
 Even when there is enough training data, fine-tuning is still preferred as it often reduces training time significantly (He et al., 2019).
 • Summary of contributions: SD, RL & JY conceptualized PPLMs and led the manuscript writing.
 These tasks are easy for humans but difficult for machines.
 Models might then achieve strong nominal test accuracy on data of the same (biased) distribution as the training set, by exploiting predictive shortcuts that are not representative of the given NLP task at hand.
 Among them, the best defenses are based on adversarial training (AT) where models are trained on adversarial examples to better classify adversarial examples during test time (Madry et al., 2017).
 However, the variance of the estimate of the mean accuracy is not the same as the variance of the accuracy.
 Furthermore, the computational complexity of these methods grows significantly with input dimension and model size.
 In such cases, the KL divergence is undefined.
 The first category is supervised learning, i.g,to learn a mapping between the input expressions and the output simplified expressions from a large number of human-constructed expression pairs (Arabshahi et al., 2018; Zaremba & Sutskever, 2014).
 Inspired by neural architecture search (NAS)(Zoph & Le, 2016; Zoph et al., 2017; Zhong et al., 2018a;b; Guo et al., 2018), a reinforcement learning (RL) (Williams, 1992) method called AutoAugment is proposed by Cubuk et al., (2019), which can automatically learn the augmentation policy from data and provide an exciting performance improvement on image classification tasks.
 Some regularization methods such as mixup (Zhang et al., 2017) follow this approach, where the training examples are perturbed to the direction of the other training examples to mimic test examples.
In addition to its ethical standpoint, equal treatment of different groups is legally required by many countries Act. (1964).
 How to integrate or align these two datasets is therefore a challenging problem.
Typically, each network block is replaced with a single cheap alternative, producing a single-blocktype network for a given budget.
 Indeed, without an unambiguous yard-stick, how can competing schemes possibly be evaluated in a standardized manner?There exist many domains, such as medical imaging (Rosenkrantz et al., 2013; Lazarus et al., 2006) and machine translation (Wang et al., 2018), in which access to unambiguous ground truth, evenat evaluation time, is not practically achievable.
 However, Locatello et al., (2019) demonstrated that many existing methods for the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations are brittle, requiring careful supervision-based hyperparameter tuning.
 However, they often exhibit low success rates under the black-box setting, especially for models with defense mechanism, such as adversarial training (Madry et al., 2018; Song∗Corresponding author.et al., 2019) and input modification (Liao et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2018).
 While encouragingly Dziugaite and Roy (2017) showed that PAC-Bayesian bounds can be optimized to achieve a reasonably tight generalization bound, current bounds are still not tight enough to accurately capture the generalization behavior.
 For example, given a K-way classification model f : Rd → RK , where fi(x) stands for the predicted score of class i, we can verify some linear specification (defined by a vector c) as below:min x ∑ i cifi(x) s.t. x ∈ S, (1)where S is a predefined input space.
 Arguably the most popular models are DeepSets Zaheer et al., (2017) and PointNet Qi et al., (2017).
 For a sum-structured optimization problem of the form minwPRd 1N °N i 1 fipwq where w P Rd denotes the parameters of the model and fi : Rd Ñ R the loss function of the i-th training example, the mini-batch SGD update for K ¥ 1 workers is given aswpt 1q : wptq γptq 1 K °K k 1 1 B ° iPIk ptq ∇fi wptq , (1)where γptq ¡ 0 denotes the learning rate and Ikptq rN s the subset (mini-batch) of training datapoints selected by worker k (typically selected uniformly at random from the locally available datapoints on worker k).
 However, given their widespread use, it is paramount to gain more understanding of their dynamics, to prevent unexpected things from happening, e.g, (Cohen et al., 2018).
The vanilla algorithm for solving sequential minimax optimization is gradient descent-ascent (GDA), where both players take a gradient update simultaneously.
 Since this assumption is far from realistic, task-free CL is more practical and demanding but has been largely understudied with only a few exceptions of (Aljundi et al., 2019a;b).
 Hence, can all (positional) node embeddings provide structural relationships akin to word analogies? We provide a visual example in Appendix (Section 7) using the food web of Figure 1.
 Figure 1 shows reliability diagrams for off-the-shelf TransE and ComplEx.
 We name this phenomenon Variable Sparsity Problem (VSP), which should be avoided in many real-world tasks.
We begin by investigating two factors: over-fitting and over-smoothing.
Despite these advances, previous methods show performance differences depending on the amount of change in both shape and texture between domains.
 We can also exploit this to spend less computational power on simple and more on complicated examples.
 In the unsupervised setting, discarding only superfluous information is more challenging, as without labels the model cannot directly identify which information is relevant.
 More recently, it has been shown that if the signal is sparse in a certain domain, sub-Nyquist rate sampling can be achieved through compressive measurements and subsequent optimization of a linear system under said sparsity prior; a framework known as compressed sensing (CS) (Donoho et al., 2006; Eldar & Kutyniok, 2012; Baraniuk, 2007).
Protecting data privacy has been a major concern in many applications, because sensitive data are being collected and analyzed.
 We consider jointly optimizing over placement, i.g,, which nodes are executed on which devices, and schedule, i.g,, the node execution order on each device.
 Their motivation is three fold: a) learning provides flexibility to the choice of input modalities (classical systems rely on observing geometry through use of specialized sensors, while learning systems can infer geometry directly from RGB images), b) use of learning can improve robustness to errors in explicit state estimation, and c) learning can effectively leverage structural regularities of the real world, leading to more efficient behavior in previously unseen environments.
 These adversarial attacks systematically modify a given original input to cause a misclassification while keeping the input distortion minimal.
Part of the success of G-CNNs can be attributed to the lifting of feature maps to higher dimensional objects that are generated by matching kernels under a range of poses (transformations in the group).
 Moreover, supervising interest point detection is unnatural, as a human annotator cannot readily identify salient regions in images as well as key signatures or descriptors, which would allow their re-identification.
 The core of our method is to sample small sub-networks from the larger model during training by randomly dropping model weights as in Dropout (Hinton et al., 2012) or DropConnect (Wan et al., 2013).
In this work, we attempt to develop an understanding of the success of M-BERT.
Recent approaches to this problem of unsupervised object-oriented scene representation can be categorized into two types of models: scene-mixture models and spatial-attention models.
 In contrast to distance, the similarity is usually a bounded value 0, 1 and is in some ad-hoc way connected to a notion of distance e.g, inverse of the distance.
 Also, logic rules can only cover a small part of the possible combinations of knowledge graph relations, hence limiting the application of models that are purely based on logic rules.
 For Linear Time Invariant (LTI) models and quadratic costs, this means solving (offline) a Riccati equation (Kalman, 2001) or a linear matrix inequality (Boyd et al., 1994).
 For decentralized training of deep neural networks, Tang et al., (2018) introduce two algorithms (DCD, ECD) which allow for communication compression.
 (Lin et al., 2017) further improve the efficiency of the attack in (Huang et al., 2017) by leveraging heuristics of detecting a good time to attack and luring agents to bad states with sample-based Monte-Carlo planning on a trained generative video prediction model.
 The representation of each word is then updated based on those words whose attention score is highest.
 In particular, for each state in the environments, these methods estimate the likelihood ratio of the long-term probability measure for the state to be visited in a trajectory generated by the target policy, normalized by the probability measure generated by the behavior policy.
 We propose to formulate the problem of generating curious behavior as one of meta-learning: an outer loop, operating at cevolutionary scale will search over a space of algorithms for generating curious behavior by dynamically adapting the Equal contribution.agent reward signal, and an inner loop will perform standard reinforcement learning using the adapted reward signal.
 These three aspects together conspire to make learning challenging:
 The setup of few-shot learning is summarized in Table 1.
 These traits lend hope to the belief that good class-conditional generative models can overcome important problems faced by discriminative models.
 We restrict our attention to images, however some of our ideas may carry over to other modalities.
 As noted in Nickel & Kiela (2017), changing the geometry of the underlying latent space enables better representations of specific data types compared to Euclidean spaces of any dimensions, e.g, tree structures and scale-free networks.
 Recent work has demonstrated that machine-learning-guided optimization (Section 3) can find better sequences faster.
 Second, query efficiency is highly prioritised because in practical cases where the damage caused by the attack is high, the query budget available to the attacker will be highly limited due to the risk of being detected by the defence system or other high inherent costs (monetary or computational) of model evaluations.
 A more flexible solution is to have the agents infer the task by interacting with the environment.
In this paper, we propose RAPP, a new method of detecting novelty samples exploiting hidden activation values in addition to the input values and their autoencoder reconstruction values.
Pioneered by E (2017) and popularized by many others, e.g, (Long et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018; Ruthotto & Haber, 2018), treating the data flow as the evolution of a dynamic system is connecting machine learning and physics simulation.
 It is designed to pre-train bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers and model the representations by predicting masked words only through the contexts.
 For example, on ImageNet classification, there is a ∼ 18% gap in top-1 accuracy between a ResNet-18 and its binary counterpart when binarized with XNOR-Net (Rastegari et al., 2016), which is the method of choice for neural network binarization.
 They also show how this first phase transition relates to the structure of the dataset.
 Chen et al., (2019b) progressively grow the depth of the supernet and remove unnecessary blocks during the search.
In this work, we propose a novel homotopy-based numerical method to transfer knowledge regarding the localization of a minimizer across different task distributions in deep learning.
 It has also been pervasively used in science, such as biomedical sciences (Maes et al., 1997), computational biology (Krishnaswamy et al., 2014), and computational neuroscience (Palmer et al., 2015).
 Therefore, it is of great importance to design efficient and fast transformer architecture specialized for real-time NLP applications on the edge.
 This “representational cost of a function” is the actual inductive bias of learning—the quantity that defines our true model class, and the functional we are actually minimizing in order to learn.
To enforce the Lipschitz constraint on the WGAN critic, Arjovsky et al., (2017) originally used weight clipping, which was soon replaced by the much more effective method of Gradient Penalty (GP) (Gulrajani et al., 2017), which consists of penalizing the deviation of the critic’s gradient norm from 1 at certain input points.
In this paper, we propose a new scenario of continual learning which handles sequence-to-sequence tasks common in language learning.
 GAIL (Ho & Ermon, 2016) and its variants (Fu et al.,; Qureshi et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2019) are the recently proposed IRL-based methods, which uses a GAN-based reward to align the distribution of stateaction pairs between the expert and the imitator.
We are interested in attacking a specific problem of this kind \\u2014 zero-shot part discovery for 3D shapes.
 In addition, recent work show that defenses trained on Lp bounded perturbation are not robust at all against new types of unseen attacks (Kang et al., 2019).
 Previous work (Arjovsky & Bottou, 2017; Miyato et al., 2018a; Odena et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2018) has shown that interventions focused on the discriminator can mitigate stability issues.
Contributions.
 Without accounting for temporal developments, it is often much harder if not impossible to discover certain relationships in a scene.
 Recent literature predominantly focus on DNNs (specifically CNN image classifiers), and are shown to be highly effective (Tramèr et al., 2016) on complex models (Orekondy et al., 2019), even without knowledge of the victim’s architecture (Papernot et al., 2017b) nor the training data distribution.
 Intuitively, however, as the domains have different properties, it is not easy to find one network that does this effectively for both.
 This approach is well-motivated by the Central Limit Theorem and widely used in probabilistic deep learning models.
These fascinating abilities exhibited by biological visual systems have inspired a large field of research towards the development of neural architectures able to replicate them.
 As proposed in (Jang et al., 2016; Maddison et al., 2016; Louizos et al., 2019), the categorical distribution can be relaxed to a concrete distribution – a smoothed approximation of the categorical distribution – such that the ELBO becomes differentiable under reparametrization.
 While negative sampling makes the updates cheaper since computing the gradient no longer scales with C, it induces additional gradient noise that leads to a poor signalto-noise ratio of the stochastic gradient estimate.
 Our paper makes a first step into this direction.
Because any non-Bayesian inference process is potentially sub-optimal (De Finetti, 1937), these uncertainty estimates should ideally be relatable to Bayesian inference with a useful prior.
 Despite of the popularity of RNNs in practice, their theory is still not well understood.
 Such measures only reflect the first two or three moments of distributions, meaning they can be insensitive to global structural problems.
These novel DL systems are usually costly to obtain: generating the NASNet architectures (Zoph et al., 2018) takes almost 40K GPU hours and the MalConv authors had to test a large number of failed designs in the process of finding a successful architecture.
 Practically, SNNs still lag behind ANNs, in terms of performance or accuracy, in traditional learning tasks.
 If the classifier assigns all images within the ball the same class label, then a certificate is issued, and the input image known not to be an `p adversarial example.
Monotonic attention mechanisms fall into the flexible policy category, in which the policies are automatically learned from data.
 However, given sufficient amount of training data, the performance of representation-learning methods lags behind fully supervised deep models.
 A common paradigm for transfer learning is to train a model on a large source dataset, and then fine-tune the pre-trained weights with regularization methods on the target dataset (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2017; Yim et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018; Li & Hoiem, 2018; Li et al., 2019).
 Such a problem is carefully studied in Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996), and it can be solved via least angle regression (Efron et al., 2004), the iterative shrinkage and thresholding algorithm (ISTA) (Daubechies et al., 2004), etc.
 For such models, we have theoretical and empirical justification that deep and nonlinear architectures can enhance representation power (Telgarsky, 2016; Chen et al., 2018b; Zhou & Feng, 2018).
 Another field that has attracted a large amount of attention recently is learning representations of entire graphs.
 Oddly, while considerable attention has been devoted to defending against adversarial perturbation attacks in the digital space, there are no effective methods specifically to defend against such physical attacks.
 This requires estimating the gradient ∇θEx∼pθ(x)f(x), using a set of samples S.
Instead of modeling the intensity function, we suggest treating the problem of learning in temporal point processes as an instance of conditional density estimation.
 This has raised security concerns on the deployment of DNNs in security critical scenarios, such as face recognition (Sharif et al., 2016), autonomous driving (Evtimov et al., 2018), video analysis (Jiang et al., 2019) and medical diagnosis (Ma et al., 2019).
 As a result, the visual information is only applied to the translation task over a small and specific multimodal data set Multi30K (Elliott et al., 2016), but not to large-scale text-only NMT (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Gehring et al., 2017; Vaswani et al., 2017) and low-resource∗Corresponding author.
 The metric function then takes the features of both the labeled and unlabeled images as input and predicts the category of the query images.
 A successful incremental learner should be able to overcome both forgetting and intransigence.
 The backbone idea underpinning this line of work is very intuitive: if the representations of data from different groups are similar to each other, then any classifier acting on such representations will also be agnostic to the group membership.
 • Interleaving: The overarching rules for dealing with concurrent inbound and outboundrequests.
 We believe these connections to be conceptually important, as they permit us to understand the inherently procedural behavior of some fragments of GNNs in terms of the more declarative flavor of logical languages.
 It has been observed that applying regularization in the early phase of training is necessary to arrive at a well generalizing final solution (Keskar et al., 2017; Sagun et al., 2017; Achille et al., 2017).
 When this is the case, feedforward processes alone are often insufficient for perceptual grouping (Herzog & Clarke, 2014; Pelli et al., 2004; Freeman et al., 2012; Freeman & Pelli, 2010), and it has been suggested that our visual system leverages feedback mechanisms to refine an initially coarse scene segmentation (Ullman, 1984; Roelfsema & Houtkamp, 2011; Treisman & Gelade, 1980; Lamme & Roelfsema, 2000).
 Furthermore, it has been argued that data compression is an essential and fundamental processing step in natural brains, which inherently involves removing redundant information and only keeping the most salient features (Richert et al., 2016).
 Style transfer has historically referred to sequence transduction problems that modify superficial properties of text – i.g,style rather than content.
 Bowen, Bob, and Igor conceived the project and provided guidance through all stages of the work.
Recently, a variety of NAS algorithms have been increasingly proposed.
 Second, graph data from real-world applications often contain out-of-distribution samples, meaning that graphs in the training set are structurally very different from graphs in the test set.
 Especially, we focus on developing a sequential latent variable model for knowledge selection, which has not been discussed in previous research.
 BO’s data efficiency originates from a probabilistic surrogate model which is used to generalize over information from individual data points.
 We do, however, need to explicitly store the d× p embedding matrix in GPU memory for efficient access during training and inference.
 However, clean task-specific instance labels continue to be critical for reliable results (Goh et al., 2018; Bach et al., 2019) in spite of easy availability of pre-trained models (Sun et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018).
 The update messages in GNNs, however, only depend on the previous atom embeddings and the pairwise distances between atoms – not on directional information such as bond angles and rotations.
 However, theoretical understandings are still lacking in several important issues.
 However, this training is done synchronously, with synchronization between the different devices done on every iteration (S-SGD).
 They interpret their theory as a nonlinear version of ICA.
 They have different tradeoffs in terms of inference speed, training speed, and accuracy, and the conventional wisdom is that no one class works uniformly well across all applications.
The recent trends of improving DNN efficiency mostly focus on compressing models and accelerating inference.
 Recent theoretical work has certainly made impressive strides towards understanding optimization and generalization in neural networks.
 Many of these encoders are trained with a language modeling objective, where the representation of a context is trained to be predictive of a target token by maximizing the log likelihood of predicting this token (Dai & Le, 2015; Howard & Ruder, 2018; Radford et al., 2018; 2019).
 Firstly, the aggregators lose the structural information of nodes in neighborhoods.
Classical algorithms for estimating stationary distribution quantities rely on the ability to sample next states from the current state by directly interacting with the environment (as in on-line RL or MCMC), or even require the transition probability distribution to be given explicitly (as in PageRank).
 A direct consequence is the slow communication, which motivated communication-efficient FL algorithms (McMahan et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2017; Sahu et al., 2018; Sattler et al., 2019).
 MLE has had much success owing to its intuitiveness and flexibility.
Several methods have been proposed for verifying properties on neural networks (NN).
 Next, the gated input is used in a similar manner to gate the output of the previous time step.
 Hence, the potential benefit from the generative component of the model is far outweighed by the decrease in discriminative performance.
 These practical constraints significantly hamper the efficiency and applicability of the vanilla value iteration.
 Indeed, the overall question motivating our work is: how do the multitude of mechanisms used in deep RL training algorithms impact agent behavior?Our contributions.
Under such a realistic setting, the meta-knowledge may have a varying degree of utility to each task.
 Discovering the secondary structure of RNA is important for understanding functions of RNA since the structure essentially affects the interaction and reaction between RNA and other cellular components.
 Instead, we argue for leveraging intermediate representations that are compact and more easily predictable from features, yet simultaneously guaranteed to be predictive of targets.
 These large-scale long-sequence models yield great results but strain resources to the point where some argue that this trend is breaking NLP research1.
 SLPs, such as the famous glider in GOL (Gardner et al., 1983), are self-organizing patterns that have a local extension and can exist independently of other patterns.
For attribution, no ground truth exists.
 A natural structure for such a representation is a parse-tree whose nodes denote components, and whose weighted parent-child edges denote the strengths of detected aggregational relationships.
An alternative approach for parallel waveform generation would be to use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs, Goodfellow et al., 2014).
 Consequently, such domains have been used extensively to benchmark current NPs (Garnelo et al., 2018a;b; Kim et al., 2019).
 To address this lack of guarantees, recent line of work on provable defenses (Wong & Kolter, 2018; Raghunathan et al., 2018; Mirman et al., 2018) has proposed to train neural networks that are certifiably robust to a specific attacker threat model.
 FedProx (Sahu et al., 2018) adds a proximal term to the client cost functions, thereby limiting the impact of local updates by keeping them close to the global model.
 When an inexperienced human player is controlling the Mario to move it to the right in the upper level, it might take many trials for him/her to realize the falling to a pit and approaching the “koopa”(turtle) from the left are harmful while standing on the top of the “koopa”(turtle) is not.
 More generally, pattern de-mixing problems are pervasive in scientific areas as diverse as biology, astronomy, and materials science, as well as in commercial applications for e.g, healthcare and music.
• (nonlinear embedding) Stochastic nonlinear embedding Hinton & Roweis (2003) aims to map a group of points from a high dimensional space to a low dimensional space by minimizing the KL divergence.
 In addition, and in attempt to understand some of the subtle behaviours DNNs exhibit, e.g, the sensitive reaction of DNNs to small input perturbations, several works directly investigated the decision boundaries induced by a DNN used for classification.
 Semantic mapping is a key feature in these tasks.
 In text, slight changes to a sentence often alter its readability or lead to substantial differences in meaning.
 Consequently, it becomes an inevitable demand for DNNs to hold robustness when training data contains anomalies (Larsen et al., 1998; Natarajan et al., 2013; Sukhbaatar & Fergus, 2014; Xiao et al., 2015; Patrini et al., 2017; Vahdat, 2017; Veit et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017).
 In this regard, many techniques have been studied for their regularization effect, despite not being explicitly intended as such.
 In contrast, biased gradient estimates such Straight-Through (Bengio et al., 2013), while efficient, run the risk of convergence to poor minima and unstable training.
 As RP Tree uses random partitions, thus achieves the third goal \\u2013 eliminating priori knowledge dependence.
 Take for instance the case of a simple tabular dataset for disease diagnosis.
 This is correct in that globally interpretable models, which attempt to explain the entire model behavior, typically yield considerably worse performance than ‘blackbox’ models (Lipton, 2016).
 In some cases, similar or even higher test performance can be obtained by removing a significant portion of training data, i.g,low-quality or noisy data may be harmful (Ferdowsi et al., 2013; Frenay & Verleysen, 2014).
 Luan et al., (2017); Li et al., (2018) specialize in photo-realistic style transfer, and Li & Wand (2016); Champandard (2016) mainly target semantic style transfer.
 In short, anchor method suggests dividing the box space into discrete bins and refining the object box in the corresponding bin.
In initial literature, AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), VGGNet (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) with plain topology were proposed.
 There is a growing body of work on generating adversarial examples, e.g, fast gradient sign method (FGSM, Goodfellow et al., (2014b)), projected gradient method (PGM, Kurakin et al., (2016)), Carlini-Wagner (CW, Paszke et al., (2017)) etc.
 Similar ideas have been explored in deep image prior (DIP) (Ulyanov et al., 2018).
 Inspired by the pseudo-labeling strategy from semi-supervised learning, previous methods either used the pseudo labels in the target domain to perform joint distribution discrepancy minimization (Long et al., 2013; 2015) or developed conditional adversarial learning methods that involve one high-dimensional domain discriminator (Long et al., 2018) or multiple discriminators (Chen et al., 2017b; Pei et al., 2018).
 First, it would make learning possible in the absence of hand-engineered reward functions or manuallyspecified agent goals.
Unfortunately, both the user-item pairs and user feedback are extremely sparse compared with the search space of items.
 It has been shown that over-parametrization in width guarantees convergence in deep neural network 15.
 Even more peculiarly, some noise perturbations seem to be doubly agnostic (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2017), i.g,there exist deterministic perturbations that can result in misclassification errors with high probability when applied to different networks, irrespective of the input (denoted network and input agnostic).
 For instance, Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., (2016) proposed a simple algorithm, called DeepFool, which finds the smallest perturbation that fools a linearized version of the network.
 In addition, to provide a more intuitive assessment of selectivity, we report jitterplots for a few of the most selective units that visually display how the unit responds to the different image categories.
In contrast to the ANNs’ well advanced, salient, proficient training methodology that indicate the conception of BackPropagation(BP) (LeCun et al., 1998) along with its derivatives that consequently give rise to the convergence of ANNs and diverse categories of frameworks(ie.
Today, normalization methods are ubiquitous in the training of neural nets since in practice they significantly improve the convergence speed and stability in training.
 However, in real-world evolving graphs such as social networks, new users will join and must be represented.
However, existing approaches based on depthwise separable convolution have several crucial limitations.
 Secondly, we assume that no parameters are shared between the generative model pθ(z, x) and the variational approximation qφ,x(z).
 Specifically, channel pruning discards an entire input or output channel and keep the rest of the model with structures.
In this study, we first design an efficient segmentation network inherited from Chen et al., (2019) as our baseline model, and then propose a semi-supervised learning scheme.
 It suffers from the gradient vanishing problem, meaning that the error signal diminishes as the gradient is backpropagated, which prevents the neural networks from utilizing further training (Taylor et al., (2016)), and the gradient of the activation function is highly sensitive to the input (i.g, poor conditioning), so a small change in the input can lead to a dramatic change in the gradient.
In this paper, we depict a new approach to generate images from a semantic label map and a flexible Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) we called Deep Neural Edge Detector (DNED) which embed edge maps.
 Because of this, professional sound synthesizers usually have no choice but to rely on hardware implementations.
 There are also approaches on the redesign of neural networks towards making them inherently-interpretable, as in this paper.
 To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce a deep-learning approach that solves the co-registration, fusion and registration-at-theloss problems in an end-to-end learning framework.
 The goal of automated device placement is to find the optimal assignment of operations to devices such that the end-to-end execution time for a single step is minimized and all device constraints like memory limitations are satisfied.
 Indeed, from the early days topological descriptors such Wiener index (Wiener (1947a;b)) attempted to find a single number that uniquely identifies a graph.
 A better understanding of deep learning is a major mission in the AI field.
Traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods like HMC (Neal et al., 2011) are a standard class of methods for generating samples from the posterior distribution over model parameters.
 Surprisingly, the student network significantly outperforms the teacher network.
The latter deals with training standard discriminative classifiers without labels, i.g,, when assuming that the precise target classification task is not defined explicitly with sample labels, but implicitly with a priori knowledge.
 Variational inference constructs a variational distribution, which is usually a multivariate Gaussian distribution, to approximate the posterior.
 As the learning algorithms directly and only utilise the co-occurrence provided by large corpora, it is easy to hypothesise that the learnt vectors are correlated with the frequency of each word, which may not be relevant to the meaning of a word (Turney & Pantel, 2010) and might hurt the expressiveness of the learnt vectors.
However, these multi-view consistency algorithms struggle in distributed and noisy settings.
 (In practice, a BN layer learns a mapping that does not necessarily maintain the “zero mean, unit variance” property for the outputs. But that level of detail will not affect the validity of the discussion here.) This has been shown to improve the speed of convergence in training deep neural networks as well as improving the performance (He et al., 2016), and hence BN has become one common component of many popular deep networks.
 Recently, Curtis et al., (2017) proposes a trust region variant to achieve the same convergence rate as the cubic regularization approach.
 With time-series data, knowledge transfer direction may need to be different depending on the timestep.
 In particular, to train the model from scratch, any gradient-based optimization approach requires a learning rate warm-up stage: The optimization starts from using an extremely small learning rate, e.g, 1e−7, and then gradually increases it to a pre-defined maximum value in a pre-defined number of iterations.
 Recently, this point of view is challenged by (Santurkar et al., 2018).
 Therefore, this study aims to answer the following question: how can we systematically incorporate the desired invariance into representation learning?Invariance induction is a systematic solution to this problem, which often introduces an additional regularization term that measures the level of invariance (Edwards & Storkey, 2016; Iwasawa et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2017).
 In such scenarios, we argue that a key technique to develop is the ability to transfer knowledge from a collection of robots to a new robot quickly only by exploiting their policies while being agnostic to their different kinematics and dynamics, rather than collecting a vast amount of samples to train the new robot from scratch.
Potential areas of application for a such a metric are fundamental problems that arise in all areas where such numerical simulations are performed: among others, accuracy evaluations of existing and new simulation methods with respect to a known ground truth solution (Oberkampf et al., 2004) could be performed more reliably than with a regular vector norm.
 For example, each graph data to be passed to the network can differ in size, and it is also often desired that GNN is equivariant (invariant under the reordering of vertices) in general.
 This approach forces the features to lie on a hypersphere and has advantages of making the feature comparison intuitive and efficient.
 One class of methods generate sentence templates with slot locations explicitly tied to specific image regions.
 For meaningful application of deep learning to a range of important physical problems it is essential to enforce such spatial PDE constraints to guarantee physical consistency and reliability of the model output for scientific applications.
 To be safe, a model must be i) private to protect the training data, and ii) robust to adversarial examples.
 Proximity graphs exploit the navigability of graph structures, which the search process relies on to converge and achieve good efficiency.
 However, a similar way to characterize the expressive power of RNN is not obvious.
Three major problems are involved in MEs recognition (Zanibbi et al., (2012); Mouchre et al., (2016)): symbol segmentation, symbol recognition, structural analysis.
 To model the internal reward signal, often, the agent’s curiosity-driven behaviors are formalized as intrinsic novelty models (Schmidhuber, 1991; Singh et al., 2004; Oudeyer et al., 2007), which characterize agent’s experience to compute the novelty scores.
 In practice, people usually reply on some heuristic trials and tests to obtain the depth of a network: they first design a DNN with a specific depth and then train and evaluate the network on a given dataset; finally, they change the depth and repeat the procedure until the accuracy meets the requirement.
 SqueezeNet (Iandola et al., 2016) and MobileNet (Howard et al., 2017) substantially reduce parameter size and computation cost in terms of FLOPs on mobile devices.
 Other formulations, such as sequential attention (Ba et al., 2015; Gregor et al., 2015; Eslami et al., 2015) and channel-wise approaches (Zhang et al., 2018c) are problematic to apply when the number of instances of the same object is large.
 Recent works (He et al., 2017; Athalye et al., 2018; Uesato et al., 2018) have confirmed this concern, and showed that most of those heuristic defenses actually fail to defend stronger adaptive attacks.
 Our considered min-max formulation is fundamentally different from AT, as our maximization step is taken over the probability simplex of the set of domains.
The problem of catastrophic forgetting motivates the field called lifelong learning (Thrun & Mitchell, 1995; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Parisi et al., 2019).
 In Kirkpatrick et al., (2017), the authors adopt Fisher information matrix to prevent important weights for old tasks from drastic changes while the model is trained on a new task.
 The feature maps of such networks typically include an extra index for the rotation group SO(2).
Despite the impressive pruning rates achieved on target metrics such as weight variables and floatingpoint operations (FLOP), existing neural network pruning methods still suffer one or both of the weaknesses that (1) Additional (iterative) fine-tuning is often required to compensate the accuracy degradation, leading to slower convergence and thus more training epochs and (2) Most of existing pruning approaches are not capable of automatically and optimally allocating pruning rates across layers given a sparsity budget on target metric.
Many efforts have been devoted to developing traffic flow prediction models in the past few decades.
 This can be seen from the following motivating example: In the environment of a classical Atari game: Seaquest, it may take dozens of millions samples to converge to an optimal policy when the input states are raw images (more than 28,000 dimensions), while it takes less samples when the inputs are 128-dimension pre-defined RAM data(Sygnowski & Michalewski, 2016).
 Removal of unnecessary neurons could be done by either setting the dropout rate individually for each neuron with unbounded dropout rate (Molchanov et al., 2017) or by pruning based on the signal-to-noise ratio (Neklyudov et al., 2017).
The k-means algorithm is widely used due to its simplicity, ease of use, geometric intuition (Bottesch et al., 2016).
 The use of continuous-time transformations in CNF, instead of the discrete ones, together with efficient numerical methods such as the Hutchinson’s trace estimator (Hutchinson, 1989), helps reduce the cost of determinant computation from O(d3) to O(d), where d is the latent dimension.
The primary aim of this work is to elucidate this tradeoff between task-specific and task-wise overfitting in meta-learning.
 State-of-theart techniques to compress model scales include pruning, quantization, low-rank approximate (Han et al., 2015; Courbariaux et al., 2016; Sainath et al., 2013).
 The main goal is to obtain a good generator, which is able to successfully approximate the distribution of real data.
 We claim that integrating interpretability in a (neural) model should supply the reason of the prediction and should yield better performance.
 Both the first and the second cases should be classified as the topic of science and technology, and the third case should be classified as the topic of animals.
 Here, the goal of f is to discriminate the difference between two distributions and the goal of g is to generate a distribution with the Gaussian noise.
 One popular approach is the mixed effect models, including Gaussian process approaches (Verbeke, 1997; Zeger et al., 1988) and functional principal components (James et al., 2000).
 With such models, controlling the generative process beyond a data-driven, black-box approach is particularly important.
 It does so by first computing the output error, which is the difference between the actual and desired activity levels of output units, and then determines how the strength of connections between successively lower layers should change to decrease this error using gradient descent (Rumelhart et al., 1986).
 The prior work on the comparisons of model-based and model-free algorithms mostly focuses on their sample efficiency gap, in the case of tabular MDPs (Zanette & Brunskill, 2019; Jin et al., 2018), linear quadratic regulator (Tu & Recht, 2018), and contextual decision process with sparse reward (Sun et al., 2019).
 Since I2I translation networks typically learn one-to-one mappings due to their deterministic nature, an extra input is required to specify an output mode to which an input image will be translated.
 In this paper, we focus on the former category: visual attention over features generated by a CNN.
 Recently, the deep learning approach had been adopted to the field of PDEs as well by converting the problem into a machine learning one.
While existing research focuses on generating image adversarial examples (Szegedy et al., (2013); Liu et al., (2016); Kos et al., (2018); Arnab et al., (2018); Sharif et al., (2016); Hu & Tan (2017)), these approaches cannot be directly applied to generate effective audio adversarial examples due to the difference in audio and image inputs.
 However, till date, none of these techniques have been able to deliver state of the art test accuracy on standard benchmarks.
There are several node sampling techniques to reduce GNN computation.
 The upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm was demonstrated as optimal solution to manage regret bound in the order of O(log(T))Lai & Robbins (1985)Lai et al., (1987)Agrawal (1995)Auer et al., (2002).
 The feature invariance is usually measured by feature statistics like Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), or feature discriminators using adversarial training Ganin et al., (2016).
 These methods have greatly aided many deep learning tasks across several domains such as classification Krizhevsky et al., (2012), image segmentation Yang et al., (2017) and image reconstruction/inpainting Alvarez-Gila et al., (2017).
This work tackles the problem of precise temporal localization of events (i.g,, determining when and which events occur) in sequential data (e.g, time series, video or audio sequences) despite only having access to poorly aligned annotations for training (see Figure 1).
Recently a new class of models called graph neural networks (GNN) (Scarselli et al., 2008) were proposed.
To address this problem, researchers have been exploring methods of transfer learning (Pan & Yang, 2009) or domain adaptation (Mansour et al., 2009a; Cortes et al., 2019), where a model is trained based on labelled source data and unlabelled target data.
More recently, contextualized embeddings such as CoVe, ElMo, ULMFit and GPT (McCann et al., 2017; Peters et al., 2018; Howard & Ruder, 2018; Radford et al., 2018) have been shown to significantly improve upon aforementioned static embeddings.
Min-max optimization problems have been studied for multiple decades (Wald, 1945), and the majority of the proposed methods assume access to first-order (FO) information, i.e. gradients, to find or approximate robust solutions (Nesterov, 2007; Gidel et al., 2017; Hamedani et al., 2018; Qian et al., 2019; Rafique et al., 2018; Sanjabi et al., 2018b; Lu et al., 2019; Nouiehed et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2019).
 These approaches either require specialized genetic algorithm training schemes or still suffer catastrophic forgetting, albeit at a smaller rate.
 Furthermore, they usually require an additional fine-tuning stage to recover the performance of the original model.
 Radford et al., (2018) and Devlin et al., (2018) used Transformers to pre-train a language model and showed that the fine tuned model outperforms LSTMs on many natural language understanding and question answering tasks.
 These attributes convey linguistic, semantic, and emotional meaning beyond what is present in the lexical representation (i.g,, the text) (Wagner & Watson, 2010).
 Auto-regressive models applied in any domain suffer from this train-test time discrepancy.
 This task, which is called word attribute transfer, enables us to rewrite He is a boy as She is a girl.
 It can be seen that in spite of extensive hyperparameter tuning, SGD converges much slower than Adam during BERT training.
As machine learning approaches are able to understand and recreate the underlying distributions for many different types of objects in our world, the application of these tools in the physical sciences is a very exciting direction.
There has been many model compression techniques (Han et al., 2015a) proposed to accelerate deep model inference and reduce model size while maintaining accuracy.
 Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages.
 For example, hardware and software implementations optimized for executing an 8 bit network are sub-optimal for executing a 4 bit network, and vice versa.
 In machine learning there is a large body of work aiming to extract low-dimensional, interpretable representations of complex, often visual, data.
 Although there have been multiple efforts to overcome the difficulties in training GANs (Arjovsky et al., 2017; Metz Luke & SohlDickstein, 2017; Srivastava et al., 2017; Miyato et al., 2018), researchers are also actively studying non-adversarial methods that are known to be less affected by these issues.
 Direct behaviour learning is difficult without access to the explicit distribution of motion states.
 Therefore, the feature extraction network must have the ability to extract more abstract semantic information.
While recent work on word embeddings has focused almost exclusively on mapping methods, which require little to no cross-lingual supervision, (Søgaard et al., 2018) establish that their performance is hindered by linguistic and domain divergences in general, and for distant language pairs in particular.
 Graph scalability denotes scalability to large graphs with many nodes within the limit of practical time/space complexity, especially in training.
 In order to address this issue, there is a vast literature on transfer learning that can be applied.
To speed up the search process, a family of methods attracts increasing attention with greatly reduced computation (Pham et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018c; Bender et al., 2018).
Unfortunately, increasing the batch size in this manner is not always possible since it increases the computational resources required to train these models – often beyond the reach of conventional hardware.
 The method of DIP can be simply explained to only optimize an untrained (i.g,, randomly initialized) fully convolutional generator network (ConvNet) for minimizing squares loss between its generated image and an observed image (e.g, noisy image), and stop the optimization before the overfitting.
One recent notable strand is to learn low-dimensional continuous embeddings of the whole graphs (Hamilton et al., 2017b; Zhang et al., 2018a; Zhou et al., 2018), and then use these learned embeddings to train a classifier to predict graph labels (Wu et al., 2019).
 Despite that `1 regularization has been applied to deep learning to enforce the sparsity on weights toward compact, memory efficient networks, it sacrifices some prediction performance (Collins & Kohli, 2014).
 Critically, NAS methods indeed surpass the manually designed architectures on many tasks, such as image classification and object detection (Zoph & Le, 2016; Zoph et al., 2018).
 Indeed, while perhaps trajectory simulations should be as rich as possible, some transitions may instead add noise to the gradient update, diluting relevant signals and hindering learning.
 Even though it is language independent dependency parser, few languages are incorporated in to Malt parser, such as English, Dutch, Turkish and ItalianE. (2007).
Recent trends in personalized medicine motivate this model – instead of treating the ”average patient”, patients are separated into different groups for which the medical decisions are tailored (fig.  1b).
In Continual Learning, we aim to learn the parameters w of a model on a sequence of datasets Di = {(xji , y j i )} ni j=1 with the inputs x j i ∈ X i and the labels y j i ∈ Yi, to predict p(y∗|w, x∗) for an unseen pair (x∗, y∗).
 Describe the image and perform a state analysis.
 Several researchers are investigating this topic using sophisticated statistical models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014), adversarial loss-based models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Radford et al., 2015), and invertible flows (Kobyzev et al., 2019) and have achieved desirable performances.
 However, their interactions are still not well-studied.
 A flurry of architectural tricks and initialization techniques have been proposed, in order to mitigate the problem of exploding and vanishing gradients, ranging from residual architectures, different normalization techniques and orthogonal initializations.
 Notably the variational information bottleneck (VIB) approach (Alemi et al., 2017) is motivated by information theoretic considerations (Tishby et al., 1999) to learn a hidden representation that carries maximum information about the output and minimum information about the input.
 AnyC2C thus generalizes the restricted expression generation task of Brockschmidt et al., (2019a), where target code contains only primitive types and excludes user-defined functions.
 It is important to note, however, that benchmarks like SentEval and GLUE are primarily focusing on semantic aspects, i.g,the literal and uncontextualized content of text.
Therefore, in many practical cases, we wish that a model trained in one or more source domains is also applicable to another domain.
 In these models, the prediction of xt+1 only depends on zt+1 akin to standard Variational Autoencoder (VAE, Kingma & Welling, 2014).
 As such, we have different best-performing algorithms across distinct scenarios.
 Further, the adversarial perturbations that led to incorrect predictions were shown to be very small (in either `0, `2, or `∞-norm) and often imperceptible to human beings.
 This construction enables sampling from the latent representation and data generation via the decoder of a VAE.
KD has been an active area of research as a solution to improve the performance of a light-weight network by transferring the knowledge of a large pre-trained network (or an ensemble of small networks) as a teacher network.
 Previous efforts (Schmidt et al., 2018; Tsipras et al., 2018; Nakkiran, 2019) trying to understand this phenomenon are usually based on simple toy models or heavy assumptions, and do not provide a general theoretic framework that explicitly shows how adversarial robustness is related to standard generalization.
 The majority of methods assume that the conditional label distribution is invariant (p(y|x) = q(y|x)), and only the Shift in Feature Distribution (SFD) (p(x) 6= q(x)) needs to be tackled, neglecting any potential Shift in Label Distribution (SLD) (p(y) 6= q(y)).
 Together with the maximum-entropy principle, this leads to distributions such as Markov logic networks (Richardson & Domingos, 2006; Kuželka et al., 2018)In this paper, we propose Neural Markov Logic Networks (NMLN).
 At a first look, this problem of eliciting quality data is readily solvable with the seminal solution for eliciting distributional information, called the strictly proper scoring rule (Brier, 1950; Winkler, 1969; Savage, 1971; Matheson & Winkler, 1976; Jose et al., 2006; Gneiting & Raftery, 2007): suppose we are interested in eliciting information about a random vector X = (X1, ..., Xd−1, Y ) ∈ Ω ⊆ Rd, whose probability density function is denoted by p with distribution P.
 It has been deployed into real world applications by large-scale corporations and U.S. Census Bureau (Erlingsson et al., 2014; McMillan, 2016; Abowd, 2016; Ding et al., 2017).
 In practice, using the confidence in the localization of objects has been shown to improve the non-maximal suppression stage and consequently the overall detection performance (He et al., 2018).
 The ALE (Bellemare et al., 2013), featuring more than 60 Atari games (see Figure 1), is heavily used in this context.
 After drugs are approved through clinical trials, observational data collected about different treatment dosages prescribed to a diverse set of patients offers us the opportunity to learn individualized responses.
 For ML/DL, repeatable and fair evaluation is challenging, since there is a tight coupling between model execution and the underlying HW/SW components.
 However, for a number of classes only very few or even no clean labeled examples might be available at the representation learning stage.
 Although all the above existing methods claim it improves sample efficiency, they are all empirical results which lack a strong theory analysis of sample complexity.
 The quantities I(X;T ) and I(T ;Y ) span what is referred to as the Information Plane (IP).
 FURL can personalize models in FL by learning task-specific user representations (i.g,, embeddings) (Lerer et al., 2019; Grbovic & Cheng, 2018; Ni et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2017; Jaech & Ostendorf, 2018) or by personalizing model weights (Tang & Wang, 2018).
 In reinforcement learning, prior work to address this topic has studied both domain adaptation and domain randomization.
 Among these methods, adversarial training is the most effective defense method so far.
 Among the learning-based methods, generative adversarial network (GAN), Goodfellow et al., (2014), achieved great progress.
 Building on this concept, researchers have shown qualitatively that adversarial perturbations cause a shift in the saliency of classifiers (Fong & Vedaldi, 2017; Gu & Tresp, 2019).
 Advanced network structures, such as Hourglass (Newell et al., 2016), HRNet (Sun et al., 2019) etc., usually have multi-scale architectures in critical point detection tasks.
Nevertheless, a key factor in any algorithmic success still lies in hyperparameter tuning.
 These reduced resource requirements made the depthwise separable convolution as well as pointwise convolution (PC) more widely used in modern CNN architectures.
 With the rapid growth in the availability of labeled data for large-scale vision tasks, to the order of billions of samples (Sun et al., 2017; Zeki Yalniz et al., 2019), automating the training data subset search would make the application of DNNs much easier for non-experts, and potentially lead to datasets and models that outperform those that were curated by hand.
 Although great progress has been achieved for visual data by some recent advances (Zhang et al., 2016; 2017; Pathak et al., 2016; Noroozi & Favaro, 2016; Doersch et al., 2015; Noroozi et al., 2017; Pathak et al., 2017; Gidaris et al., 2018), the approaches are mostly designed to boost the performance of high-level recognition tasks like classification and detection.
 For a new testing instance xtest, the predicted labels are:y = labels with most instances in{f(xi)Ki=1}, i ∈ Nei(F (xtest)) (1)f(·) can be a linear mapping, a non-linear RKHS mapping, or neural network-like differentiable function.
 However, most state-of-the-art generative models employ deep multi-layer architectures, which are difficult to interpret or explain.
 However, significant computational advancements have been made recently, for which a summary is given by Peyré et al., (2019).
Traditional data imputation methods usually suffer from imposing strong statistical assumptions.
One major branch of RLfD proposes to leverage demonstration data in a supervised manner, by either using them to directly pretrain the policy (Silver et al., 2016) or supplement the learning target of the policy with a supervised objective when encountering the states in demonstration data (Rajeswaran et al., 2017a).
 Therefore, it is urgent to tackle this problem.
 Then, a dot product with activations is conducted as ∑q i=1(αi ∑v j=1 ajbi,j), where aj is a full-precision activation.
 Alas, these approaches are inefficient and can be extremely computationally and/or memory intensive as some require all tested architectures to be trained from scratch.
 It is thus designed to output high maximum values, even for small differences in the logits z.
 At their core, these approaches employ recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) whose input and hidden states are modified to account for the missing observations.
 Linear bandit algorithms have achieved great success in both theory and practice, such as news article recommendation (Li et al., 2010).
 For example, DeepFace (Taigman et al., 2014), the face recognition system of Facebook, used about 0.22 million face images for testing.
 Training is generally stable, and since every data point is assigned a region in latent space, sampling yields the full variety of data seen during training.
We use the recently developed activation atlases technique (Carter et al., (2019)) in order to visualize the inputs that activate an entire hidden state, as opposed to a single neuron.
 Effectively and accurately synthesizing point cloud data is still a challenge task.
Like most machine learning algorithms, summarization models can also be divided into supervised and unsupervised categories.
Most of the existing continual learning literature concentrates efforts on either alleviating catastrophic forgetting, maximizing knowledge transfer or addressing ways in which to efficiently store subsets of past data.
 In this case, a low value suggests a less entangled joint distribution.
 Compared with the first two categories, generative approaches have great advantages in interpretability.
 More recently, in the deep setting, Hendrycks & Gimpel (2017) showed empirically that the maximum softmax probability can be used to predict network confidence.
 However, continual learning presents one major challenge, catastrophic forgetting (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989).
 Recently, Higgins et al., (2018) assigned a principled definition by connecting symmetry transformations to vector representations using the group and representation theory.
To bridge the gap between simulation and the real world, we can either aim to align both domains (Ganin et al., 2016; Bousmalis et al., 2016; Wulfmeier et al., 2017) or ensure that the real system is covered by the distribution of simulated training data (OpenAI et al., 2018; Tobin et al., 2017; Pinto et al., 2018; Sadeghi & Levine, 2016; Viereck et al., 2017).
 For example, the sampling rate of ground motion sensor is 100Hz and the duration of an earthquake is about 10sec.
 Briefly, the metric nearness problem seeks the closest metric to a given set of distances, the goal of correlation clustering is to partition nodes in a graph according to their similarity, and metric learning finds a metric on a dataset that is consistent with (dis)similarity information about the data points.
 We focus on the task of deep regression using squared `2-loss which yields state-ofthe-art results in human pose estimation (Toshev & Szegedy, 2014), facial landmark detection, age estimation (Lathuilière et al., 2019), and more.
 To avoid hand designed heuristics, several works propose to optimize a parameterized neural network to learn the data usage schedule, but most of them are tailored to specific use cases, such as handling noisy data for classification (Jiang et al., 2018), learning a curriculum learning strategy for NMT (Kumar et al., 2019), and actively selecting data for annotation (Fang et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2018).
The problem of reasoning requires machine comprehension models to gather and compose over different pieces of evidence spread across multiple paragraphs.
 Fewshot learning is an artificial learning skill of rapidly generalizing from limited supervisory data (few labeled examples), typically without the using of any unlabeled data (Koch et al., 2015; Miller et al., 2000; Lake et al., 2011).
 The current state of affairs makes it difficult to translate advancements in pre-training from English to non-English languages.
 The studies that do combine both end-to-end learning with natural-language data do so in less realistic grid-like environments (Misra et al., 2017) or grant agents access to privileged global observations to make learning more tractable (Misra et al., 2018).
 The global structure includes the overall shape of the dataset, placement of the clusters, and existence of potential outliers.
 That is, why deep neural networks have a low generalization errorEgen = E(x,y)∼D `(f(x), y)− 1 |S| ∑(x,y)∈S`(f(x), y) (1)which is the difference between expected error on the target distribution D and the empirical error on a finite dataset S ⊂ X × Y .
 The reasons for this are numerous and involved, but the basic intuition is that DP-SGD involves clipping gradients and then adding noise to those gradients.
Related work Our work relates to two main strands of literature: (i) models of information aggregation in social networks and (ii) deep multi-agent reinforcement learning as a tool to solve games.
In this work, we use the following definition of pre-training: the ability to use data from a set of tasks to improve performance on unseen, but related tasks.
3D CNNs instead convolve (i.e. take a weighted average) over both the temporal and spatial dimensions of the sequence.
For an intelligent system to be deployed in the real-world, not only does it have to do well on the designated task, but perhaps more importantly it should defer its actions when faced with unforeseen situations.
 The reads obtained from sequencing are noisy, meaning that some of the letters (called base pairs) are flipped to a different letter or, in some cases, the deletion or insertion of additional base pairs can occur.
 Aleatoric uncertainty only considers data uncertainty derived from statistical randomness (e.g, inherent noises in observations) while epistemic uncertainty indicates model uncertainty due to limited knowledge or ignorance in collected data.
 These encoder-decoder based neural semantic parsers produce one candidate given an input sentence, essentially acting as both the generator and the critic.
The research community has approached this problem from different directions.
 In gradient sparsification, a compressor Compk is applied on each worker to locally select k, k ≤ d, gradients for aggregation and Compk ∈ {Topk,Randk} (Stich et al., 2018).
 Numerous attempts have been made to tackle with this model bias problem but none of them have been really successful, such as using Gaussian Process (GP) (Deisenroth & Rasmussen, 2011; Gal & Ghahramani, 2016), Bayesian Neural Networks (Gal et al., 2016; Depeweg et al., 2016a; Kamthe & Deisenroth, 2017), and Emsembling (Kurutach et al., 2018; Clavera et al., 2018).
In this work, we consider one such property corresponding to the behavior of the unknown function as it approaches 0 and∞.
Two main types of attack settings have been considered in recent research (Goodfellow et al.,; Carlini & Wagner, 2017a; Chen et al., 2017; Papernot et al., 2017): black-box and white-box settings.
 Different divergence metrics essentially define a different inference algorithm which leads to different properties of the approximation.
 They also make the calibration of neural networks difficult.
 Such decay schemes, however, typically lead to poor performance on standard neural network problems.
 Under this framework, different methods in this category differ mostly in how and where the noise injection is applied.
In this work, we open a different line of enquiry, namely: can the interpolation property be used to design a robust and efficient optimization algorithm for deep learning? In order to answer this question, we begin by giving the following two desiderata of an optimization algorithm for deep learning: (i) an inexpensive computational cost per iteration (typically a call to a stochastic first-order oracle); and (ii) adaptive learning-rates that do not require a manually designed schedule.
 Given its importance, it is still in an early development stage in comparison to the progress made in representation learning on natural and medical images (eg. by Raghu et al., (2019)).
 The resulting model, Dual Video Discriminator GAN (DVD-GAN), is able to generate temporally coherent, high-resolution videos of relatively high fidelity (Figure 1).
In the last couple of years, several empirical defenses have been proposed for training classifiers to be robust against adversarial perturbations (Madry et al., 2018; Samangouei et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Papernot et al., 2016; Kurakin et al., 2016b; Miyato et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2016) Although these defenses robustify classifiers to particular types of attacks, they can be still vulnerable against stronger attacks (Athalye et al., 2018; Carlini & Wagner, 2017; Uesato et al., 2018; Athalye & Carlini, 2018).
Finding architectures that offer the best accuracy possible given particular resource constraints is nontrivial.
 Tabular data is indeed the most common data type in the entire addressable artificial intelligent market (Chui et al., 2018).
 Jia et al., (2016) presents Dynamic Filter Networks to generate context-aware filters for increasing the flexibility and adaptiveness of networks.
 Unlabeled data can be used to learn properties of the distribution of features, which then allow for more sophisticated and effective regularization schemes.
 This mismatch raises interesting questions for both linguists and practitioners of NLP.
 Although mapping nodes with similar local structures to similar feature vectors might be desirable in some applications (Henderson et al., 2012), this feature can make the GNN unable to distinguish graphs whose difference is not in their local structures.
 For example, as shown in Figure 1, a DNN trained on clean MNIST digits fails to classify shifted digits.
 Though only for two-layer networks, this result significantly simplifies our understanding of the training dynamics.
 We show in this paper that constrained black-box sampling can be cast as a constrained Langevin dynamics with gradient-free methods.
 But existing deep learning methods are mainly statistical with little or no underlying physical knowledge incorporated, and are yet to be proven to be successful in capturing and predicting accurately the properties of complex physical systems.
 Specifically, we introduce a metric between MDPs and prove that the optimal Q-value function is Lipschitz continuous with respect to MDPs.
 In the MIPS setup, given a query q ∈ Rd, we would like to find the datapoint x ∈ X that has the highest inner product with q, i.g,, we would like to identifyx∗i := arg max xi∈X 〈q, xi〉.
To study DNNs on noisy data, previous work often performs controlled experiments by injecting a series of synthetic noises into a well-annotated dataset.
Link prediction in knowledge graphs is a problem that is studied extensively, and has applications in several tasks such as searching (Singhal, 2012) and automatic question answering (Ferrucci et al., 2010).
 Up until the recent method of Shafahi et al., (2019b), multi-step adversarial training had taken many days to train on large datasets (Kannan et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2018).
 However, the part of the input that causes problems in deep networks is mainly from the information that deep networks were not able to learn from the training data.
 As such, metadata can enhance graph learning models (31; 20), and conversely, graphs can be used as regularizers in supervised and semi-supervised models of node features (32; 11).
 Recently, neural network approaches have also been proposed, including retrieval methods which select the best question from past experience (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016) and encoder-decoder frameworks which map visual or linguistic inputs to questions (Serban et al., 2016; Mostafazadeh et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2017; Yao et al., 2018).
 Specifically, existing models mostly focus on sentence-level rewriting.
 However, these approaches depend on the agents luckily stumbling on these actions in order to grasp their benefit.
 However, adversarial training is known to increase test error significantly.
 However, it is restricted to a specific type of adversarial perturbations and not generalized to other types of perturbations (Tramèr & Boneh, 2019).
 The pattern of node attributes are often similar in a neighborhood, and conversely, nodes with similar attributes are more likely to be connected.
 Training deep neural networks is data hungry and needs bigger “brains”.
 They report similar findings across several other pairs of popular image datasets.
 More importantly, most of the existing graph generation models are unconditioned and thus ignore rich input graph information for generating a new graph.
 Given that the number of actions is inherently unbounded in continuous domains, traditional approaches to building the search tree become intractable from a computational perspective.
 Yet it can easily be seen that this object of “tooth brush” does not fit into the context with other labels.
The autoregressive nature of these components leads to slow synthesis, because they operate sequentially at a high temporal resolution of waveform samples and spectrogram.
Most commonly, the tasks of NER and RE are approached as a pipeline, with NER preceding RE.
 Though the algorithmic details vary, most of these NAS methods face the common challenge of evaluating the test/validation performance of a (combinatorially) large number of candidate architecture evaluations.
 Besides studying adversarial effects on network prediction decisions, this work explores the connection between adversarial robustness and network interpretability, and provides novel insights on when and how interpretability helps the robustness.
 What is particularly of interest is that the breakthrough for GANs has been made with a simple technique of progressively growing neural networks of generators and discriminators from low-resolution images to high-resolution counterparts (Karras et al., 2018a).
 The motivating question we would like to address is: are adversarial examples really adversarial examples from the model’s perspective?In order to get insight of this question, we extend an existing visualization technique from Dosovitskiy & Brox (2016b); Johnson et al., (2016); Dosovitskiy & Brox (2016a), stacking a decoder head on top of the model’s latent representation with the aim of providing a human interpretable reconstruction, see Figure 1.
 Another method is to design models that ”explain” the decision making process automatically.
 For instance, in the learning optimization approach, the following works have been done (Zhang et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2017b).
 Literature shows adversarial examples have transferability property and they can affect different models, even the models have different architectures (Szegedy et al., 2014; Papernot et al., 2016a; Liu et al., 2017).
 Spectral clustering not only outperforms commonly used clustering methods, such as k-means (Von Luxburg, 2007), but also allows us to directly minimize the pairwise distance between data points and solve for the optimal node embeddings analytically.
BERT can be used to solve almost all NLP tasks, and especially it can perform best on datasets with short text, e.g, GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) and Squad (Rajpurkar et al., 2016).
 That is to say, the LR image will be further processed into a compressed JPG (C-JPG) image.
 For example, generative adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014) can be trained to sample very high dimensional densities, but they do not provide density estimation or inference.
 The primary limitation of such templates is coverage, i.g,, it is possible that none of the templates applies to a test molecule.
 We take several basic algorithms (selection sort, merge sort, Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest paths) and express them in terms of a series of subroutines, as a software engineer would.
 An assistive home robot must infer a human’s intended goal by interacting with them.
For example, recent work has emphasized situations where the data lies not on one single manifold, but on multiple, disconnected manifolds (Khayatkhoei et al., 2018; Gurumurthy et al., 2017; Hoang et al., 2018).
 However, these algorithms are very complicated, which generally consist of many hand-crafted rules and heavily rely on expert knowledge, thus being difficult to generalize to other combinatorial optimization problems.
 Most deep RL algorithms fail to learn from data that is not heavily correlated with the current policy (Fujimoto et al., 2018b).
Nearly all previous methods for deep embeddings are deterministic: an instance projects to a point in the embedding space.
A well-known challenge to train agent to perform ROS with RL is the sparse reward issue, due to the fact that the environment and/or the location of the target object are typically unknown.
 The transformer learns strong dependencies between its inputs and has the ability to be stacked as many times as hardware can handle.
 Federated learning aims to keep data on-device by training models in a distributed fashion (Konecný et al., 2016).
 In deep CNNs (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014; Zeiler & Fergus, 2014; Szegedy et al., 2015; He et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017), the object-of-interest and surrounding competing objects can provide equal context to a receptive field of a boundary pixel, which can make accurate classification difficult.
The distributed vector representations of tokens, called token (or word) embeddings, are a crucial component of neural methods for sequence modeling.
 Global explanations can be obtained by extracting common explanations from multiple local approximations.
 The SAT problem asks if a given formula can be satisfied (evaluated to >) by assigning proper Boolean values to the variables.
 For example, the uniform prior assumption over datasets emphasizes equal contributions from each data point regardless of the underlying distribution; small batch sizes help achieve more generalizable solutions, but do not scale as well to vast computational resources as large mini-batches.
 But, they suffer from slow sampling process, making them unacceptable to adopt in real world applications.
 If the learned dynamic is accurate enough, the agent can acquire the desired skill by simply interacting with the simulated environment, so that the number of samples to collect in the real world can be greatly reduced.
 Two representative models that have drawn great attention are Temporal Convolution Networks(TCN) (Bai et al., 2018) and Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017).
 Access to player tracking data changed how we understand and analyze sport (Miller et al., 2014; Franks et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2013; Cervone et al., 2014; Power et al., 2017; Sha et al., 2016; 2018; Yue et al., 2014).
 Work on pruning deep neural networks has demonstrated a remarkable ability to sparsify a model to a fraction of the original weights while giving up minimal test-set accuracy (Cun et al., 1990; Hassibi et al., 1993b; Han et al., 2015; Ullrich et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; Louizos et al., 2017; Collins & Kohli, 2014; Weigend et al., 1991; Nowlan & Hinton, 1992; Lee et al., 2018b).
 However, the HRL often requires explicitly specifying task structures or sub-goals (Barto & Mahadevan, 2003; Arulkumaran et al., 2017).
 A clear historical example is that of linear programs (LPs).
 Thus one of the core challenge in model-based DRL is learning accurate and computationally efficient transition models through interacting with the environment.
 For example, RBMs perform both learning and Bayesian inference in graphical models with latent variables.
 For example, by focusing on slight background differences, a discriminator can achieve perfect generalization, assigning zero reward to all held-out agent observations.
 Some heuristic algorithms (Baltacioglu et al., 2006) try to obtain a nearly optimal solution within polynomial time, but these methods require explicit rules for every specific problem setting.
 Deep neural network techniques (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Lecun et al., 2015; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015; He et al., 2015), especially supervised learning techniques, have achieved impressive successes on various tasks.
 While on the other hand, some studies have discovered how attention in neural models captures several linguistic notions of syntax and coreference (Vig & Belinkov, 2019; Clark et al., 2019; Tenney et al., 2019).
 Given a loss function ` : Y × Y → R and a constraint constant > 0, the adversarial robust risk isRrob(f) = EX,Y max ‖δ‖p≤`(f(X + δ), y)  .
The most popular, as well as simple, way to perform aggregation is via majority voting rule.
 The mapping (i.g,, f(·)) from hyper-parameter values to a performance metric (e.g, classification error) of using those hyper-parameter values is unknown.
 Guided back propagation (Guided BP) (Springenberg et al., (2014)) has been used for explanation by generating the gradient from prediction to input, which shows how much the output will change with a little change in each dimension of the input.
 Actually, planning a proper retrosynthetic route for a complex molecule is also a tough work even for the professional chemists.
 However, how all of these measurements relate is typically unknown.
A good visual landmark should be tightly localized, consistent across multiple object instances, and grounded on the foreground object of interest.
 The second requirement, discrimination, is crucial for auditing model reliability (Schulam & Saria (2019)), detecting dataset shifts and out-of-distribution samples (Barber et al., (2019a)), and actively collecting new training examples for which the model is not confident (Cohn et al., (1996)).
 Also, a large bulk of works are developed in reinforcement learning for sequential inference of the environment with partial observation, non-future aware states, and world dynamics.
 However, since S2 is lexically and semantically similar with S1, standard models can be easily confused.
 There is a known theoretical limit to this reduction.
 Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) (Abadi et al., 2016) is the current state-of-the-art, used extensively for training privacy-preserving neural networks.
However, the node feature update performed by GNNs introduces important limitations.
 In practice, the discriminator is usually too powerful for its task.
 A classifier F is a function from X to Y .
 Sparse rewards, which carry little or no information besides binary success or failure, are much easier to design.
 The exponential of the entropy rate can be interpreted as the effective support size of the distribution of the next word (intuitively, the average number of “plausible” word choices to continue a document), and the perplexity score of a model (the exponential of the cross entropy loss) is an upper bound for this quantity.
 The weights for each element can be automatically learned by self-attention.
 Its main concerns are how to perturb an input image and draw the model’s response on the perturbed instance to the final heat map.
 For example, consider a simple multi-round game where at the end of each round of this game, the agent will be assigned a reward, representing whether it wins this round.
 And x̃ncij and x̄ncij represent normalized channel features and standardized channel features respectively. γ and β are two vectors of parameters, where each element re-scales and re-shifts the standardized features for each channel c.
 Discovering such discrete modes is useful for scientific applications (c.f., Wiltschko et al., (2015); Linderman et al., (2019)) as well as for planning in the context of hierarchical reinforcement learning (c.f., Kipf et al., (2019)).
 Typical approaches require a priori knowledge of noise rates, i.g,, a set of parameters that control the severity of label noise.
 PPEs provide us a way to rigorously define dissimilarity between policies.
Temporal clustering has been recently used as a data-driven framework to partition patients with time-series observations into a set of clusters (i.g,, into subgroups of patients).
 Data privacy and server cost are some major issues, driving research towards deploying these models on edge-devices.
 This causes majority of the networks to be memory-bound, making DNN training impractical without batching, a method where training is performed on multiple inputs at a time and updates are aggregated per batch.
 Thus, the memory space scales linearly in the size of graph while quadratically in the feature dimension (Chiang et al., 2019; Zou et al., 2019).
 Despite the first success, Adagrad was later found to demonstrate degraded performance especially in cases where the loss function is nonconvex or the gradient is dense.
 However, things become different for ResNet.
 Tracking is also a fundamental capability found in many natural visual systems.
Recent approaches (Wu et al., 2018a; Cai et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018b; Xie et al., 2018; Pham et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018c; Brock et al., 2017; Bender et al., 2018) adopt a weight sharing strategy to reduce the computation.
In this paper, we focus on local explanation as it extracts the intuitive evidence behind the decision of each instance.
 There are usually three steps in these methods’ framework.
 Szegedy et al., (2014) explain that adversarial examples are possible because the image space is densely filled with low probability adversarial pockets.
 In application, Bayesian optimization has been widely applied in machine learning for hyper-parameter tuning (Snoek et al., 2012).
Significant effort has gone into a number of high quality MD packages such as LAMMPS (Plimpton, 1995), HOOMD-Blue (Anderson et al., 2008; Glaser et al., 2015), and OpenMM (Eastman et al., 2017).
 For instance, VAEs tend to generate blurry samples, while reversible generative models require restricted neural network architectures or solving neural differential equations (Grathwohl et al., 2019).
 In addition, quantization based approaches are preferable for mobile devices and embedded systems since these devices are gradually equipped by specifically designed low bit computing hardware.
 During the past few years, a number of deep neural network defense methods have been developed, including adversarial training (Kurakin et al., 2016; Szegedy et al., 2013), defensive distillation (Papernot et al., 2016b; Carlini & Wagner, 2016; Papernot & McDaniel, 2016), Magnet (Meng & Chen, 2017) and featuring squeezing (He et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2017).
 However, in practice, the graph filtering view have inspired many computationally fast and high accuracy models such as ChebNet (Defferrard et al., 2016), GCN (Kipf and Welling, 2017), SplineConv (Fey et al., 2018), LanczosNet (Liao et al., 2019), and label efficient models (Li et al., 2019).
 Specifically, these gating functions are typically static and trained via an alternate transformation over the original input.
 However, many practically relevant systems involve DNNs that lead to sequential outputs (e.g, an RNN that generates captions for images, or the states of an RL agent).
In the last few years, a significant number of evaluation metrics for GANs have been introduced in the literature (Salimans et al., 2016; Heusel et al., 2017; Bińkowski et al., 2018; Shmelkov et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2019; Kynkäänniemi et al., 2019; Ravuri & Vinyals, 2019).
 Another kind of approach is to prune redundant connections in the networks.
 To bridge this gap, the field of physics-based learning (PBL) aims to blend physical priors with data-driven inference, to combine the best of both worlds.
 The temporal axis of a spectrogram is orders of magnitude more compact than that of a waveform, meaning dependencies that span tens of thousands of timesteps in waveforms only span hundreds of timesteps in spectrograms.
 Such approaches despite being highly effective, severely burden the human-in-the-loop demanding either expert demonstrations (Ross et al., 2011) or explicit feedback (Christiano et al., 2017).
Active Learning (AL) (Settles, 2009; Bodó et al., 2011), following this lead, provides solutions that select “informative” examples as the initial training set.
 Notions of Individual Fairness have also been advanced (Dwork et al., (2012); Joseph et al., (2016); Zemel et al., (2013)).
An important degree of freedom in the TSC problem is the compression set used to train the student.
 Therefore, given a certain generative model, we can derive a corresponding discriminative model.
As an illustration, we will show throughout the paper that urban spatio-temporal prediction task suffers from not appropriately handing spatial and temporal unsmoothness.
 The underlying causal structures of such data often vary (Zhang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019).
 Conditional formulations of these models (Mirza & Osindero, 2014; Van den Oord et al., 2016) allow controlling the sampling behavior to be class or embedding specific.
 One has been to decompose data into disentangled factors of variation and situate each datapoint in the resulting - typically continuous - factor vector space (Vedantam et al., 2018; Higgins et al., 2018).
 In this special case, outliers can be found by simply hardcoding some fixed distance as the cutoff between which points are classified as inlier or as outlier, such as is done by EllipticEnvelope (7).
With such an explosion of interpretability methods (hereon referred to as explainers), evaluating them has become non-trivial.
 It can be used for either assisting radiologists (Letham et al., 2015) or help visually impaired people to understand their environment more flexibly (Antol et al., 2015).
There is a rapidly growing body of work on studying how to obtain a robust neural network model.
 Our artificial agents should be able to do the same, learning and adapting quickly.
 A calibratable policy would be able to generate trajectories consistent with various styles, such as low movement speed as in Figure 1b, or approach the basket as in Figure 1c, or to both styles simultaneously as in Figure 1d.
 Many studies have attempted to address this challenge by focusing on several issues.
 In practical scenarios, however, it is usually costly to acquire clean and complete data due to the limited human resources and time.
 In addition to providing better energy efficiency per arithmetic operation, custom hardware offers more flexibility in various strategies to reduce the computational and storage complexity of the model inference, for example by means of quantization (Baskin et al., 2018; Hubara et al., 2018; Jacob et al., 2018) and pruning (Han et al., 2016; Louizos et al., 2018; Theis et al., 2018).
Many recent video models use Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) as a basic block (Xingjian et al., 2015), where spatio-temporal information is encoded as a tensor explicitly in each cell.
 Narang et al., (2017) have shown promising results for structured training of RNNs while sparse CNNs could not achieve the same performance (Mao et al., 2017).
 Adding parameter-less “shortcut” or skip connections allows for deeper networks to be trained increasing their accuracy (He et al., 2016).
 Traditional methods try to solve this problem via learning domain invariant features by minimizing certain distance metric measuring the domain discrepancy, for example Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) (Gretton et al., 2009; Pan et al., 2008; 2010) and correlation distance (Sun & Saenko, 2016).
 Here, connection denotes the existence of a path between the models, parameterized by their weights, along which loss is nearly constant.
An important question with invariant data is to understand the reason for the empirical high accuracy from theoretical aspects.
 It yields knowledge about the structure of the data, reduces storage requirements, makes downstream computation more efficient, and alleviates the curse of dimensionality.
 (2) Mikolov et al., (2013b); Pennington et al., (2014); Levy et al., (2015); Tian et al., (2016) and other works observe that word embedding exhibits two nice properties: the word similarity such that words with similar semantic meanings are embedded closely in the embedding space, and the analogy structure such that “woman is to queen as man is to king”.
 This research has implications for neural network pruning, where a puzzling question has arisen: if larger parameter counts don’t increase overfitting, how does pruning parameters throughout training improve generalization?To address this question we first introduce the notion of pruning instability, which we define to be the size of the drop in network accuracy caused by a pruning iteration (Section 3).
 However, recent work suggested that even with powerful posteriors, VAE may still fail to match aggregated posterior to unit Gaussian prior (Rosca et al., 2018), indicating there is still a gap between the approximated and the true posterior.
 To avoid dimension partitioning altogether, multiple approaches based on efficiently estimating the log-determinant of the Jacobian, necessary for applying the change of variable formula, have been proposed to allow for free-form Jacobian structure (Grathwohl et al., 2019; Behrmann et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019).
 Compared with the other more traditional verification approaches (e.g, Wong & Kolter, 2017; Jordan et al., 2019; Dvijotham et al., 2018) that exploits special structures of the neural networks (such as the properties of ReLU), the randomized smoothing methods work more flexibly on general blackbox classifiers and is shown to be more scalable and provide tighter bounds on challenging datasets such as ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009).
The main contributions of this paper are:
 Works such as Hardt et al., (2016) and Kleinberg (2018) have investigated this type of ambiguity by showing that certain fairness criteria cannot be simultaneously satisfied.
 The directed and weighted world graph edges characterize feasible traversals among the waypoints.
By marginalizing over a posterior distribution over the parameters given the training data, Bayesian inference provides a principled approach to capturing uncertainty.
 While this approach leverages graphs’ unique property of capturing relations, it appears less capable of generalizing to new or unseen graphs (Wu et al., 2019b).
 A large collection of the techniques build saliency maps by attributing the gradients of the neural network to the input image through various procedures or by finding perturbations that significantly change the output(Springenberg et al., 2014; Bach et al., 2015; Montavon et al., 2017; Shrikumar et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2016; Selvaraju et al., 2017; Smilkov et al., 2017; Fong & Vedaldi, 2017; Adebayo et al., 2018a; Dumitru et al., 2018; Singla et al., 2019).
 Many methods are proposed to improve network robustness, which can be roughly categorized into three perspectives: (1) modifying input or intermediate features by transformation (Guo et al., 2018), denoising (Liao et al., 2018; Jia et al., 2019), generative models (Samangouei et al., 2018; Song et al., 2018); (2) modifying training by changing loss functions (Wong & Kolter, 2018; Elsayed et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019), network distillation (Papernot et al., 2016), or adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Tramer et al., 2018) (3) designing robust network architectures (Xie et al., 2019; Svoboda et al., 2019; Nayebi & Ganguli, 2017) and possible combinations of these basic categories.
Beyond how they define information, existing theories of Deep Learning are limited by whose information they address: Most approaches focus on information of the activations of the network – the output of its layers – rather than their parameters, or weights, although recent information-theoretic approaches to study the weights are discussed in the next section.
 It arises because Q-learning updates the value of state-action pairs using estimates of (sampled) successor-state values that can be mutually inconsistent given the policy class induced by the approximator.
 To bridge this gap, in this work we explore fully unsupervised representation learning techniques to enable downstream unsupervised learning methods on those critical domains.
Current methods of screening, such as Modified Early Warning System (MEWS) and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) have been criticised for their lack of specificity, leading to low accuracies and high false alarm rates.
Hard-label black-box attacks, also known as decision-based attacks, consider the most difficult but realistic setting where the attacker has no information about the model structure and parameters, and the only valid operation is to query the model to get the corresponding decision-based (hard-label) output (Brendel et al., 2017).
 Recently, a promising direction is training networks only on selected instances that are more likely to be clean (Jiang et al., 2018; Han et al., 2018b; Ma et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019).
 An example of such a problem would be estimating disease density for a small geographical region of interest, in which case the probability of label l is likely to depend on the labels for neighboring regions due to semantic coherence among them.
 Deep RL is no exception: Many works have demonstrated that deep RL agents are also vulnerable when attacked by adversarial examples (Behzadan & Munir, 2017a; Huang et al., 2017), raising serious concerns on the reliability of these agents for security-critical applications.
 However, training GAN requires finding a Nash equilibrium of a non-convex minimax game with continuous, high-dimensional parameters.
Identifying these ‘decision states’, i.g,states in the environment where a high amount of relevant goal information is needed, leads to better understanding of the environment structure, which has the potential to enable better transfer to novel environments and tasks.
There have been many approaches proposed to address this problem under the umbrella of OOD detection1.
 The first feature of human IL can be represented within the framework of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) (Ng et al., 2000; Abbeel & Ng, 2004; Ziebart et al., 2008), which at a high level casts the problem of imitation as one of matching outcomes rather than actions.
 To employ n-step returns in an off-policy setting, subtrajectories of the exploratory policy have to be stored.
 For example, consider a robot which must learn to adapt to a changing environment.
 According to (Sutton & Barto, 2018), there are three key aspects in building a data-efficient agent for reinforcement learning: generalization, exploration, and long-term consequence awareness.
Research in neural network robustness has tried to quantify the problem by establishing benchmarks that directly measure it (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2018; Gu et al., 2019) and comparing the performance of humans and neural networks (Geirhos et al., 2018b; Elsayed et al., 2018).
 In particular, Soft Actor Critic (SAC), which combines off-policy learning with maximum-entropy RL, not only has many attractive theoretical properties, but can also give superior performance on a wide-range of Mujoco environments, including on the high-dimensional environment Humanoid for which both DDPG and TD3 perform poorly (Haarnoja et al., 2018a;b; Langlois et al., 2019).
 Recent works (Morcos et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019) have studied other properties of the winning tickets generation process: Morcos et al., (2019) have shown that winning tickets can be transferred across datasets with similar natural image statistics, and Yu et al., (2019) have exposed the existence of lottery tickets to other domains, such as text and reinforcement learning.
 The manifold learning aims at requiring f under various constraints on y (Tenenbaum1 et al., 2000; Roweis & Saul, 2000).
 In particular, short-time Fourier transforms (STFTs) can be used to considerably reduce the temporal dimension of the representation for an underlying signal.
 Distillation (Schmidhuber, 1991; Hinton et al., 2015) can improve the accuracy of a compressed network by using information from the original, uncompressed network.
 We adopt Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as the core of our model, to leverage its elegant self-attention mechanism designed for learning contextualized representations.
 The goal of sparse representation learning is to recover w∗ based on the given data.
 While at face value it may then appear that Alice is more complex, upon closer inspection we may find that Alice has simply memorized a set of actions to construct a house in that particular environment! How can we be certain that our agents are not simply not memorizing a set of moves? One hypothesis is that the more intelligent an agent is, the more likely the inner representations in its policy will exhibit disentangled properties of the world.
 Arguably, the most prominent ones are Runge-Kutta methods, a family of integration methods for initial value problems.
 Such iteration is repeated many times until the model has converged.
 For the scaling factor 1/mβ (β < 1), Du et al., (2019) essentially demonstrated that the kernel smoothing of functional gradients by the neural tangent kernel (Jacot et al., 2018; Chizat & Bach, 2018b) has comparable performance with the functional gradient as m → ∞ by making a positivity assumption on the Gram-matrix of this kernel, resulting in the global convergence property.
 The first candidates are the two-person matrix game minψ maxθ ψTAθ or general convex-concave problems.
 We investigate independent MARL in games that are solvable by iterated elimination of dominated strategies (Moulin, 1979).
 TP-N2F encodes the natural-language symbolic structure of the problem in an input vector space, maps this to a vector in an intermediate space, and uses that vector to produce a sequence of output vectors that are decoded as relational structures.
 But it only conditions on the words generated by itself during reference.
In this work, we propose the predicate zero-shot learning (PZSL) problem setting focusing on recognizing the unseen predicates (no manual annotations or image samples).
1 Asymptotically, a vanishing fraction of the information in the past is relevant to the future (Bialek et al., 2001), thus systems which excel at prediction need not memorize the entire past of a sequence.
 Sampling different geometric structures is, however, still largely left to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation that suffers from the rare event sampling problem, although recently machine learning has been used to speed up MD simulation (Ribeiro et al., 2018; Bonati et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019; Plattner et al., 2017; Doerr & Fabritiis, 2014) or to perform sampling of the equilibrium distribution directly, without MD (Noé et al., 2019).
 Due to thermal fluctuations resulting in stretching of and rotations around bonds, there exist infinitely many conformations of a molecule.
 Another common issue is that data used for training and deployment may differ in their generation process: data may be collected on different devices, background noise or compression schemes may affect differently training or deployment data, leading to a shift in data distribution.
 Unlike the standard machine learning paradigm, where a model is trained on a set of exemplars, meta-learning is performed on a set of tasks, each consisting of its own training and test sets (Vinyals et al., 2016).
 A generative classifier explicitly model conditional distributions of inputs given the class labels.
 Such learning-based approaches are attractive since one could automate the design of approximation algorithms with less reliance on sophisticated knowledge.
In learning a classification algorithm from a few labeled examples, one may train the algorithm with a different set of abundantly labeled data (base set); before adapting it to the unknown examples.
 Existing approaches that tackle the point-cloud stream forecasting problem can be categorized into two classes, both of which bear significant shortcomings: (i) methods that transform point-clouds into data structures amenable to processing with mature solutions, e.g, grids as exemplified in fig. 1 (Zhang et al., 2019a); and (ii) models that ignore the exact locations of each data source and inherent spatial correlations (Liang et al., 2018).
 For clarity, we unify these approaches as latent optimised GANs (LOGAN).
 Moreover, even if this optimization were tractable, another short-coming of this objective is that the resulting policy cannot be used to solve new tasks: it only knows how to maximize state entropy.
 The common idea of the two approaches is that a good generator pθ(x|z) is the one able to generate the data that is as close as possible to the visible one, i.g,that with respect a certain metric D, the distance between the marginal pθ(x) = Ep(z)pθ(x|z) and the visible distribution pD(x) is minimal.
 Previous works (Tsipras et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019; Fawzi et al., 2018; Nakkiran, 2019) provide simple constructions to explain the increase in test error with adversarial perturbations, but rely on assumptions, such as incorrect labeling of the adversarial perturbations or insufficient complexity of the hypothesis class, that we do not expect to hold in practice.
 Under this paradigm, the NN architecture is sampled from the agent’s policy, which in turn is optimized to maximize the performance of the generated models on the downstream task.
 However, these methods require pre-defined network structures and pruning the model weights after training.
 In particular, recently proposed GAN models have successfully demonstrated multi-manifold learning by using multiple generator networks (Khayatkhoei et al., 2018; Ghosh et al., 2017; Hoang et al., 2018) or giving a mixture density on the latent space (Xiao et al., 2018; Gurumurthy et al., 2017).
 Despite their popularity and their important role in pioneering the few-shot learning field, we argue that the Omniglot and miniImageNet benchmarks should not be taken as gold standards for evaluating supervised few-shot classification because they rely on consistent class semantics across episodes.
 The distribution of future sequences is diverse and highly multi-modal.
 However, often global feature importance represents relevant features for the entire population, that may not characterize local explanations for individual samples.
 Still, deep networks and their embeddings exhibit some shortcomings that are at odds with our idealized model of a linear classifier on top of interpretable high-level features.
 Searching on such huge designed space cost 2400 GPU days.
 However, imitation of good experiences within limited directions might hurt exploration in some cases.
However, in many real-world applications such as co-authorship networks, recommendation networks, etc., vertex labels can be naturally represented by probability distributions or histograms.
Learning such invariant representations has been a desired objective since the early days of artificial neural networks (Simard et al., 1992).
 Recent HRL approaches (Nachum et al., 2018; Levy et al., 2019) use states as goals directly, allowing simple and fast training of the lower layer.
Within MBRL, commonly explored methods include action-conditional, next-step models (Oh et al., 2015; Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018; Chiappa et al., 2017; Schmidhuber, 2010; Xie et al., 2016; Deisenroth & Rasmussen, 2011; Lin & Mitchell, 1992; Li et al., 2015; Diuk et al., 2008; Igl et al., 2018; Ebert et al., 2018; Kaiser et al., 2019; Janner et al., 2019).
 The problem is formulated as a Quadratic Program with inequality constraints, and then solving its dual problem provides an efficient computation for a small number of dual variables.
While this performance is encouraging for a fixed kernel, the best accuracy is still under 78%, which is disappointing even compared to AlexNet.
 Take DOOM (Kempka et al., 2016) as an example, the primary objective of the agent is to kill as many enemies as possible.
To strictly bound the impact of any training example, DP-SGD makes two changes to every gradient step: first, each example’s gradient contribution is limited to a fixed bound (in practice, by clipping all per-example gradients to a maximum `2 norm); second, random (Gaussian) noise of the scale of the clipping norm is added to each batch’s combined gradient, before it is backpropagated to update model parameters.
 meProp (Sun et al., 2017; Wei et al., 2017) sparsifies backpropagating by selecting a subset of output gradients in each layer.
 In this work, we focus on the latter, which has been shown to dominate the energy footprint of CNN inference on custom hardware (Yang et al., 2017).
 To be specific, we are looking for generating a dataset with the property that machine learning models trained on the generated dataset can exhibit similar performance to ones trained on the original data.
A variety of strategies have been developed in imitation learning to learn from expert behavior, where the expert can be a human (Stadie et al., 2017) or a pre-trained policy (Ho & Ermon, 2016).
 For example, the ternary weights networks (TWN, Li et al., 2016) yields only three quantized values, which prohibits the networks from utilizing high weight values.
Membership inference attacks are shown to exploit overfitting of the model on the training dataset (Yeom et al., 2018).
 For example, an agent in a large complex landscape can only obtain very limited information from its immediate surroundings and it is desirable that it still maintains an accurate global scene representation that could also be changing with time.
 The smoothness assumption states that samples close to each other are likely to have the same label.
 In each iteration, SGD calculates one stochastic gradient ∇f(w; ξi) and updates w by w← w−η∇f(w; ξi), or updates w with a mini-batch of stochastic gradients.
 The input patterns are images with 28 \\u00d7 28 pixels, so a priori we work in the high-dimensional R784.
 We argue that minibatch stochastic gradient descent exhibits two regimes with different behaviours: a noise dominated regime and a curvature dominated regime (Ma et al., 2017b; McCandlish et al., 2018; Liu & Belkin, 2018).
 As a result, separate systems have been studied extensively in the literature and in fact are the standard way of coding for many scenarios.
As a remedy, we propose Constrained Adversarial Networks (CANs), a class of generative models that extend GANs to structured domains.
 Entire modes of the true data distribution can be missed – commonly referred to as the mode collapse problem.
 Alternatively, task-agnostic OoD detection methods solely use the input data for the unsupervised training of a deep generative model (DGM).
In this paper, we study a more global learning problem: learning to count subgraph isomorphisms (counting examples are shown as Figure 1).
However, almost all of this work has focused exclusively on adversarial perturbations whose magnitude is constrained by an lp norm.
 Filter methods attempt to remove irrelevant features prior to learning a model.
 2) End-to-end trainable: It is advantageous to learn neural representations in an end-to-end manner to directly optimize for the task at hand (Liu et al., 2018).
 The only exceptions are Yang et al., (2019) which studied the fitted Q-iteration (FQI) algorithm (Riedmiller, 2005; Munos & Szepesvári, 2008) with action-value function approximation based on a sparse ReLU network, and Cai et al., (2019a) which studied the global convergence of Q-learning algorithm with an i.d. observation model and action-value function approximation based on a two-layer neural network.
 While computing the posterior is challenging, it is usually easy to perform maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation, which corresponds to a mode of the posterior.
 First, such sampling procedures may be inefficient, requiring a large number of samples for adequate learning.
 For example, model-free methods on Atari (Bellemare et al., 2013) and DeepMind Control (DMC) (Tassa et al., 2018) take tens of millions of steps (Mnih et al., 2013; Barth-Maron et al., 2018), which is impractical in many applications, especially robotics.
 Interestingly, such perturbations created for one model exhibit transferability of attack and induce high fooling on other models.
 For instance, Zhao et al., (2018) observed severe performance degradation in multi-class classification accuracy under highly skewed non-IID data; it was reported that more diminishing returns could be yielded as the probabilistic distance of learners’ local data from the population distribution increases.
 In particular we explore the generalization dynamics of neural nets trained via gradient descent.
 However, these methods still suffer from poor sample efficiency due to the credit assignment problem.
A key question regarding crowdsourcing contests (or equivalently, all-pay auctions) is how to design the contest to optimize the utility achieved by the principal.
 Doing so, we obtain a semi-supervised learning approach that is trained with so-called "lazy" labels, that is a lot of coarse annotations of class instances together with only a few pixel-wise annotated images that can be obtained from the coarse labels in a semi-automated way.
 Note that multi-label learning is a generalization of multi-class classification which aims to predict a single mutually exclusive label.
 This can be implemented in an elegant manner by equipping the decoder with a facility that can “point” to words from the input, which are then copied into the output (Vinyals et al., 2015; Grave et al., 2017; Gulcehre et al., 2016; Merity et al., 2017).
 Bjorck et al., (2018) argued that this not only explains why batch normalization helps during optimization, but also explains why it improves the final test accuracy, since large learning rates are thought to generalize well (Keskar et al., 2016; Smith & Le, 2017; Jastrzębski et al., 2017).
 Among them we find the cumulative sum algorithm (4) or the change finder for auto-regressive processes (18).
 The shift from word embeddings to sequence embeddings in recent times began when (Dai & Le, 2015) showed that pre-trained sequence to sequence autoencoders on text corpora could be useful for a number of downstream tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis.
 Extending the framework to semantic segmentation networks will allow each pixel to have an “in” or “out of” distribution classification.
 In recognition systems, it could be an adversarial attack.
 We propose to directly maximize the entropy of the history states by exploiting the mutual information between the history states and a number of reference states.
Under the assumption that sequential signal instances are correlated, we consider the following sequential signal reconstruction problem:min ht {1 2 ‖xt −ADht‖22 + λ1‖ht‖1 + λ2R(ht,ht−1) } , (2)where λ1, λ2 > 0 are regularization parameters and R(ht,ht−1) is an added regularization term that expresses the similarity of the representations ht and ht−1 of two consecutive signals.
 We propose a new, semi-structured compositional filtering approach to blur the line between free-form and structured representations and learn both.
 This departs from the standard scenario in that unlabeled data are now directly contributing to the cost function being minimized and to subsequent parameter updates, rather than just being used to perform inference for acquisition, whereby parameters are fixed.
 Additionally, this evaluation method based on error analysis is usually applied to only a single dataset (Karpathy et al., 2015; Kummerfeld & Klein, 2013; Kummerfeld et al., 2012), lacking discussion of fine-grained analysis in a multi-dataset setting.
 Most previous research focuses on the design of metro network from scratch (Gutiérrez-Jarpa et al., 2018; Laporte & Pascoal, 2015).
 This is primarily achieved by modifying spectral and prosodic features while retaining the linguistic information in the given speech signal (Stylianou et al., (1998)).
 In the case of the Dual space Preconditioned Gradient Descent (DPGD) of Maddison et al., (2019), an optimal preconditioning can lead to convergence in one iteration.
 The goal is to embed each example so that questions of two types can be answered (see Figure 1(a)): (1) Is the set of classes in example xa equal to the union of the classes in examples xb and xc? (2) Does the set of classes in example xa subsume the set of classes in example xb? Importantly, we focus on settings in which the classes present in the example must be perceived automatically.
 Once it is learned from the training set, we can predict the labels of test examples from unseen classes by selecting the most relevant attributes on this relationship.
Quantization of fixed-point arithmetic (Q-FX) for DNN inference has been extensively studied, and more recently there has been increasing interest in quantized floating point (Q-FP) arithmetic for both DNN inference and training (Wang et al., 2018).
 This, combined with the memory wall—a lack of bandwidth between compute and memory—suggests that, while computation may be sufficient moving forward, the mechanisms for moving data to the compute may not (Wulf & McKee, 1995; Kwon & Rhu, 2018; Hsieh et al., 2017; Zinkevich et al., 2010).
 Another way to enforce low rank is by explicitly parametrizingX in factorized form, X = Y Z>.
 First, many research efforts have developed image de-noising (or filtering) networks that can pre-process an image before classification, but at the expense of additional latency in the processing pipeline (Ronneberger et al., (2015); Na et al., (2019); Xie et al., (2012); Zhussip & Chun (2018); Soltanayev & Chun (2018); Zhang et al., (2017)).
While most machine learning work studies the generalization error, i.g,, the error when testing on different samples from the same distribution, we do not take the match of train and test distribution as given.
 This can be achieved by manually trying several different static sharing patterns.
 It is a representational model of natural image pair that are related by local pixel displacements.
Recent developments in machine learning have resulted in significant advancements in computer vision and computer graphics, including computer-based painting systems.
 Data scarcity can have many reasons: data collection itself might be expensive, e.g, in healthcare, or happens only gradually, such as in a cold-start situation.
 When additional data are unavailable, it may be possible to improve the intermediate learned representation of the data with respect to the target task by considering additional tasks intrinsic to the data.
 The present paper builds upon the methodological framework proposed by (Jalalzai et al., (2018)) performing classification in extreme regions with guarantees concerning the excess risk of the ERM classifier.
All of these models can be described schematically by Figure 1a. Events ei, ei+1, . are assumed to be conditionally independent of previous events, given the system state si (which may or may not be fully known given events e1, . , ei).
 The resulting method has been used to certify non-norm-bounded properties of ACAS Xu networks (Julian et al., 2018) and improve Integrated Gradients (Sundararajan et al., 2017).
 In data-parallel SGD, a large dataset is partitioned among K processors.
 Recently, there has been renewed interest in studying random, infinite, networks starting with concurrent work on “conjugate kernels” (Daniely et al., 2016; Daniely, 2017) and “mean-field theory” (Poole et al., 2016; Schoenholz et al., 2017).
 For images, relevant features are typically extracted from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (LeCun et al., 1998).
 They are particularly effective to solve long memorization tasks Henaff et al., (2016).
 However, advances in designing robust DNNs have been followed with stronger perturbation schemes that defeat such defences (Athalye et al., 2018).
An image analog of graph neural networks is convolutional neural networks, whose key components are convolution and pooling.
 Attention has been a vital component of the models for natural language understanding and natural language generation.
 Other works concentrate specifically on networks with piecewise linear activation functions, using the number of linear regions (Montufar et al., (2014)) or the volume of the boundaries between linear regions (Hanin & Rolnick (2019)) in input space.
 Therefore, many techniques (Johnson et al., 2016; Ledig et al., 2017; Isola et al., 2017) have been proposed for making the output images look perceptually pleasing to human.
 The latter is often a model-based approach that relies on analytical models of the underlying observed phenomenon (Ubelmann et al., 2015; Sirjacobs et al., 2011; Lguensat et al., 2017).
 While this process has led to simple and well-performing algorithms, it fails to take into account the intrinsic diversity of the predictions of the ensemble, as represented by the individual predictions of each of its members.
Varieties of generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) models for text generation have emerged as alternatives to MLE models with the hope of not suffering from exposure bias.
 When dealing with challenging new RL domains it is helpful to develop tools for addressing strategic and tactical decision-making.
At the same time, deep generative models have demonstrated impressive performance in learning disentangled semantic factors through data generation in an unsupervised (Radford et al., 2015; Karras et al., 2018; Brock et al., 2019) or weakly-supervised manner based on semantic attributes (Yan et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2018).
 Hybrid methods often use MCMC or VI as an algorithmic component of the other.
 We define each of these views as a channel.
 For a task related to graph topology, the convolutional filter can help GNN nodes to get better task-specific representations (Xu et al., 2019).
To combat these two issues, we propose to harness a state-of-the-art generative inpainting model (hereafter, an inpainter) to remove features from an input image and fill in with content that is plausible under the true data distribution.
 These few-shot learning methods in essence are learning to learn i.g,the model learns to quickly adapt itself to new tasks rather than just learning to give the correct prediction for a particular input sample.
 Inspired by nature, we propose a new paradigm for constructing deep neural networks as a recursive repetition of a fixed set of neurons.
 If it works well, such a system will help drivers avoid crashing, thus making self-refuting predictions which result in SIDS.
 The key idea of FMs is learning a latent vector of each one-hot encoded feature, and capture an arbitrary pairwise (order-2) interaction by inner product of respective latent vectors.
 These bonus rewards are associated with state novelty to incentivize an agent to explore those novel states.
In the strongly-supervised setting, existing methods (Hendricks et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Ghosh et al., 2019) generally learn joint visual-semantic representations by projecting video and language representations into a common embedding space and leverage provided temporal annotations to learn regressive functions (Gao et al., 2017) for localization.
 Indeed, human perceptual representations have been shown to linearize(or \\u2018straighten\\u2019) the temporal transformations found in natural videos, a property lacking from current supervised image recognition models (He\\u0301naff et al., 2019), and theories of both spatial and temporal predictability have succeeded in describing properties of early visual areas (Rao & Ballard,1999; Palmer et al., 2015).
To address this difficultly in determining the potential energy, the Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (DFT) may be used to simplify the calculations by considering the electronic density in place of individual electrons.
 We wish to find a collection of experts, which as an ensemble can perform a given task well, however, also targets behaviour cloning through adversarial behaviour.
We start by drawing a parallel between entity embeddings in knowledge graphs and unsupervised word embeddings, as learned by algorithms such as Word2Vec (W2V) (Mikolov et al., 2013) and GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014).
 For example, it takes hours for an experienced radiologist to segment the brain tumors on medical images for even just one case.
 In this scenario, the constraints are dynamic with uncertainty, which is challenging to define proper constraint.
 Reduced precision methods exploit the inherent noise resilient properties of deep neural networks to improve compute efficiency, while minimizing the loss of model accuracy.
 Applications of ES outside RL include for example meta learning (9).
 The ability to uncover a confidential network not only would make it available for public use but could even expose data used to train the network if such data could be reconstructed from the network’s weights.
 Critical semantic and visual information regarding the task, such as the appearance of the target object or the type of task performed, is not taken into account during training and reproduction.
 In the last two decades, such ill-posed inversion problem has been exhaustively investigated in the community of signal processing (Becker et al., 2011; Daubechies et al., 2004; Needell & Tropp, 2009).
 This is partially because the raw graphs were constructed from the original feature space, which may not reflect the “true” graph topology after feature extraction and transformation.
 To properly deal with these real-world conditions with insufficient information, it is critical to learn the shared data distribution that is effective both in the source and target domain.
 However, the audio domain poses unique challenges not addressed by prior certification work for vision.
 Overall, the method provides statistical guarantees for l2-norm robustness around a given input (e.g, an image).
Although BNNs have these theoretical advantages, they have not been used as a practical tool.
Several (Saad and Solla, 1995; Amari et al., 2006; Wei et al., 2008) works explored the implications of weight-space symmetry for training dynamics in two-layer networks and found that training dynamics slow down near the singular regions caused by weight-space symmetry.
 In the early studies of KT such as knowledge distillation (KD) (Hinton et al., 2015), researchers took advantage of the output vector from teacher networks, converted it into “soft target” and trained the student network with the soft target and the ground-truth.
 A different strategy of defense is to detect whether the input has been perturbed by detecting characteristic regularities either in the adversarial perturbations themselves or in the network activations they induce (Grosse et al., 2017; Feinman et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2017; Metzen et al., 2017; Carlini & Wagner, 2017; Roth et al., 2019).
On the algorithmic front, prior work has focused on the stability and convergence properties of gradient descent-ascent (GDA) and its variants in GAN training and more general min-max optimization problems; see e.g, (Nagarajan & Kolter, 2017; Heusel et al., 2017; Mescheder et al., 2017; 2018; Daskalakis et al., 2017; Daskalakis & Panageas, 2018a;b; Gidel et al., 2019; Liang & Stokes, 2019; Mokhtari et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2019) and their references.
 Word embeddings have local context (view) in the sense that they are learned based on local collocation pattern in a text corpus, where the representation of each word either depends on a local context window (Mikolov et al., 2013) or is a function of its sentence(s) (Peters et al., 2018).
 In fact, it is very rare to see state-of-the-art neural models trained without any regularization in a supervised setting.
 Annotating image segmentation masks is a very time consuming and labor extensive task.
 Other researches such as GEM (Lopez-Paz et al., (2017)), VCL (Nguyen et al., (2018)) introduced an additional memory called coreset which consists of the small number of real images of past tasks to further improve WR algorithm.
 Discovered skills may help the exploration in complex environments, and can also serve as primitive skills for hierarchical DRL.
 It requires: (a) understanding some English and (b) guessing which sequence the test-writer considers most natural among the many consistent ones.
Thus, methods for prediction and augmentation of measured flow data are actively researched.
 BNNs only keeps the sign of weights and compute the sign of activations {−1,+1} by applying Sign function in the forward pass.
 Throughout this paper, we attempt to answer the following questions.
 The modular nature also helps compositionality (Andreas et al., 2016) and transferability (Kansky et al., 2017).
 For example, if we have two servers located at Shanghai and Boston respectively, even at the speed of light and direct air distance, it still takes 78ms∗ to send and receive a packet.
 However, if we consider for instance machine translation, online prediction generally comes at the cost of reduced translation quality and more research is needed to reach the grail of natural and high-quality online speech-to-speech interpretation.
 Beginning with (Goodfellow et al., 2014), GANs have often been interpreted as the generator performing approximate minimization of a function defined implicitly by maximization over the discriminator.
 Recently, most methods only focus on final predictions in different tasks (He et al., 2016).
 Depending on where the orange ball starts or what bias the model has, the ball could either end up on the left or right side.
 A number of semi-supervised classification methods (Belkin et al., 2006; Weston et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2016) classify nodes in an attributed graph by training a supervised classifier on node features with some kind of graph regularizer.
Feature-based explanation is commonly based on measuring the fidelity of the explanation to the model, which is essentially how close the sum of attribution scores for a set of features approximates the function value difference before and after removing the set of features.
 GANs have strong theoretical foundations since the beginning.
In this work we study Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models, and besides the likelihood, we also investigate to what extent the latent representation of a data point can be used to identify out-ofdistribution (OOD) samples (points that are not from the true data distribution).
 Several techniques have been proposed to encode knowledge in non-overlapping representations or; preserve or limit changes to the weights corresponding to the learned knowledge.
The towering empirical success of ANNs has brought into focus their profound incongruity with what we know about the brain: backpropagation requires that and synaptic weights and plasticity be informed by downstream events.
 Similarly for sentences (3) and (4).
 The concept of spectral bias is appealing because this may intuitively explain why over-parameterized neural networks can achieve a good generalization performance without overfitting.
 However, the optimization performance of the stochastic algorithm near local optima is significantly limited by the mini-batch sampling noise, controlled by the learning rate and the mini-batch size.
 This continuous-to-discrete mapping will mean that quantization will necessarily have zero derivative almost everywhere.
 But, to date, classical approaches to bound the generalization error have failed to provide much insight into deep networks.
 Exploration strategy design is still one of the challenging problems in RL, especially when the environment contains a large state space or sparse rewards.
 When we encounter such choices, we examine them to first understand their functionality which informs our selection process while solving a task.
 The consequences of neglecting heteroscedastic noise are illustrated using a second example in Figure 2.
 However, deep learning approaches based on approximation with finite order polynomials tend to be non-robust to even minor changes in the graph structure and to largely disregard the local graph topology that often plays the critical role for learning on heterogeneous graphs.
 The framework consists of mainly three steps:
 The learned model can then be used for planning, thereby minimizing the number of environment interactions.
 In this paper, we aim to provide more insights towards solving these challenges by proposing a unified optimization framework AdvCodec to generate adversarial text against general NLP tasks.
 While representations for aleatoric uncertainty can be learned directly from data, approaches for estimating epistemic uncertainty focus on placing probabilistic priors over the weights and sampling to obtain a measure of variance.
 In this way, exploration behaviors are naturally temporally-extended via accomplishing self-generated goals.
 For a Gaussian pg(x|z) of diagonal covariance matrix, log pg(x|z) reduces to the varianceweighted squared error (Doersch, 2016).
 For example, when we want to predict the chemical properties of a particular toxic molecule, despite the general task dependency, its representations learned from toxicity prediction tasks should be more significant than the other tasks.
 As a motivating example, consider a scenario wherein a model is trained for the task of fetal head detection from labeled ultrasound images collected in a hospital in Finland (source domain Sfin).
 However, such reduced inputs are usually unnatural to a human reader, and it is both unclear what behaviour we should expect from natural language models evaluated on unnatural text, and how to use such unnatural inputs to improve models.
 The core idea behind these models is first training a language model on a very large corpus and then initializing down-stream models with the weights learned from the language modeling task.
We frame the problem of understanding the relationship between these complementary data sources and tissue-specific protein function as one of developing protein embeddings on top of which simple machine learning models can be trained to map a given protein to its tissue-specific function.
The best results on XNLI so far have been achieved by using XLM (Lample & Conneau, 2019), a contextualized multilingual language model that is pre-trained on unlabelled text and then tuned in a supervised manner separately for each language in the XNLI dataset.
In this paper we study the use of linear embeddings for HDBO, and in particular we re-examine prior efforts to use random linear projections.
 Do curvature-corrected learning methods simply accelerate convergences towards the same minimum solutions as gradient descent, or do they impose implicit bias toward qualitatively different solutions?As a first step toward establishing theoretical understanding of these questions, we analyze the exact learning dynamics of deep linear networks under a spectrum of curvature-corrected update rules.
 In the medical dataset MIMIC III (Johnson et al., 2016), among 17,000 unique ICD-9 codes, more than 50% of them never occur in the training data.
 The later relates to optimal interpolation and kriging (8), which is among the state-of-the-art and operational schemes in geoscience (10).
 A natural question that arises is how to develop learning systems that scale from few-shot to many-shot settings while yielding competitive accuracy in both.
 Owing to this limitation, traditional approaches to improve SGD training time in the context of deep learning largely resort to distributed asynchronous setup (Dean et al., 2012; Recht et al., 2011).
A common approach to mitigate the negative influence of noisy labels is to eliminate them from the training data and train deep learning models just with the clean labels (Frénay & Verleysen, 2013).
 However, these methods typically ignore the hidden structural information associated with a word˚Corresponding author.
 Considering recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and the resulting increase in the complexity of experimental benchmarks, the use of Deep Learning (DL) models, e.g, deep neural networks, has become a popular and effective way to extract common features among tasks in MTRL algorithms (Rusu et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016; Higgins et al., 2017).
 Furthermore, global pooling are not hierarchical so that we cannot apply them where multiple pooling operations are required, such as Graph UNet (Gao & Ji, 2019a).
 This fact greatly limits the performance and broad application w.r.t. different problem settings considering its NP-hard nature.
 Although graph CNN based methods have achieved considerable capabilities of graph embedding by optimizing filters, they are limited into a conventionally semi-supervised framework and lack of an efficient inference mechanism on graphs.
 Recent methods based on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) overcome this issue by training an RL agent not only to imitate demonstrated actions, but also to visit demonstrated states (Ng et al., 2000; Wulfmeier et al., 2015; Finn et al., 2016b; Fu et al., 2017).
 As additional evidence, a large number of Kaggle ML competitions with tabular data are still won by the shallow GBDT methods (Harasymiv, 2015).
 Although the pseudo label generation and feature learning with pseudo labels are conducted alternatively to refine the pseudo labels to some extent, the training of the neural network is still substantially hindered by the inevitable label noise.
 However, new products do not differ drastically from the existing ones, so it should be possible to discover them automatically as they arise in the data.
 With many actions, there is a higher probability that one of the estimates is large simply due to stochasticity and the agent will overestimate the value.
 In this paper, we address the problem of transferring knowledge from the decentralized nodes to a new node with a different data domain, without requiring any additional supervision from the user.
Universal Transformers (UT) rely on ACT for dynamic computation and repeatedly apply the same layer (Dehghani et al., 2018).
 However, it has been noted that the value of the `1 regularizer is proportional to the scaling of parameters (i.g, ||αW ||1= |α|·||W ||1), so it “scales down” all the elements in the weight matrices with the same speed.
 To this end, we compare the quality of the NAS solutions with a random search policy, which uniformly randomly samples an architecture from the same search space as the NAS algorithms, and then trains it using the same hyper-parameters as the NAS solutions.
 However, random samples from a learned VAE model with Gaussian latent codes are not guaranteed to be diverse for two reasons.
 SGD can be accelerated by replacing the instantaneous gradient estimates by a momentum aggregating all gradient in past iterations.
 To the best of our knowledge, lifelong language learning has been studied in only a few instances; for sentiment analysis (Chen et al., 2015b; Xia et al., 2017), conversational agents (Lee, 2017), word representation learning (Xu et al., 2018), sentence representation learning (Liu et al., 2019), text classification, and question answering (d’Autume et al., 2019).
long run because the unsatisfied drivers may be demotivated and even leave the company.
 A spatial method iteratively updates the representation of each graph node by aggregating representations from its neighbors, i.g,, adjacent nodes (Xu et al., 2018).
 For a ‘well-calibrated’ model, predictions with higher confidence should be more likely accurate.
 Note that A is a continuous space, whereas X is finite.
 Since Smyl’s approach heavily depends on this Holt-Winters component, Makridakis et al., (2018b) further argue that “hybrid approaches and combinations of method are the way forward for improving the forecasting accuracy and making forecasting more valuable”.
 However, the expressiveness of these methods is limited due to the impaired knowledge generalization between highly related tasks.
 Among these methods, contrastive divergence (Hinton, 2002) is proven effective in certain types of models.
 Besides these techniques, quantizing high-precision floating-point networks to lower bitwidth representation can also drastically decrease both the static parameters and the intermediate data generated during the network inference, resulting in reduced memory footprint and also computational intensity.
 Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a special type of weakly supervised learning and a typical example of inexact supervision (Zhou, 2017).
 Recently introduced expansion-based approaches handle this problem by expanding the network capacity as they adapt to new tasks (Rusu et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2017; Yoon et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019).
 Excessive adaptation could lead to inadvertent forgetting of how to perform earlier tasks.
 In standard attacks which directly use the classification output, the noise points in the direction of the nearest decision boundary at the classification layer (Trame\\u0300r et al., 2017).
 However, when tested with the same benchmark instances, these learning-based methods cannot outperform the state-of-the-art method LKH3 (Helsgaun, 2017), which is a penalty-function-based extension of classical Lin-Kernighan heuristic (Lin & Kernighan, 1973; Helsgaun, 2000).
 As the representations are separate, Bi-encoders are able to cache the encoded candidates, and reuse these representations for each input resulting in fast prediction times.
 Therefore, they quantize each weight kernel independently for higher accuracy by calculating a QBN -element scaling factor vector for each kernel, rather than globally quantize all the kernels of a layer as a whole.
 However, less attention has been paid to these searched architectures for further insight.
 Some recent work (Karkus et al., 2017; McAllester & Singh, 2013; Babayan et al., 2018) tries to solve POMDPs under the model-free setting, i.g,, the agent does not need to know and learn the transition function of the environment.
 These algorithms, however, often require extensive searching (Bertsekas & Tsitsiklis, 1996, Chap. 5) over the large state-action space to estimate the optimal action value function.
 (1)The fundamental properties of MI are well understood and have been extensively studied (see e.g, Kraskov et al., (2004)).
 On the empirical side, there is no common ground between recently proposed empirical benchmarks.
 Under these defenses, the input image is transformed in a certain way before feeding into the CNN, such that the transformed adversarial image would no longer be adversarial.
 We can see that both operations incur information loss.
 These immediate counterfactual regrets are defined by the counterfactual rewards and can be iteratively minimized by existing online learning algorithms, e.g, regret matching (RM) (Blackwell et al., 1956).
 For example, two DNNs extract totally different features, but these features may be computed using similar sets of visual concepts, i.g,encoding consistent knowledge (a toy example of knowledge consistency is shown in the footnote1).
 Imagebased rendering (IBR) introduced variants of view-dependent texturing that blend input images on the shape (Buehler et al., 2001; Heigl et al., 1999; Carranza et al., 2003; Zheng et al., 2009).
 Recently, some exciting works have related the implicit bias to specific first-order algorithms (Wilson et al., 2017), stopping time (Hoffer et al., 2017), and optimization geometry (Gunasekar et al., 2018a; Keskar et al., 2017).
 Recently large-scale pre-trained language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Peters et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019) have surged to dominate the other algorithms to approach human performance on several textual entailment tasks (Wang et al., 2018; 2019).
 One major complication is that the standard version of MAML requires estimating second derivatives of the RL reward function, which is difficult when using backpropagation on stochastic policies; indeed, the original implementation of MAML (Finn et al., 2017) did so incorrectly, which spurred the development of unbiased higher-order estimators (DiCE, (Foerster et al., 2018)) and further analysis of the credit assignment mechanism in MAML (Rothfuss et al., 2019).
 The concept has emerged from the idea of Universal Turing Machine (UTM) (Turing, 1936) and further developed in Harvard Architecture (Broesch, 2009), Von Neumann Architecture (von Neumann, 1993).
Model-based reinforcement learning has shown promise in generalizing to novel objects and tasks, as learned dynamics models have been shown to generalize to new objects (Finn & Levine, 2016; Ebert et al., 2018b), and can be used in conjunction with planning to reach goals unseen during training.
 To address these challenges, various learning methods and communication protocols are proposed to stabilize training and improve observability.
 This can be a significant bottleneck in what these functions can represent efficiently, particularly when relations between elements of the set need to be modeled (Murphy et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019b).
 This restriction provides us with some advantages: (1) it enables us to derive strong baselines for grammar induction with reduced time and space complexity, offering a chance to reexamine the current status of existing grammar induction methods, (2) it facilitates an analysis on how much and what kind of syntactic information each pre-trained LM contains in its intermediate representations and attention distributions in terms of phrase-structure grammar, and (3) it allows us to easily inject biases into our framework, for instance, to encourage the right-skewness of the induced trees, resulting in performance gains in English unsupervised parsing.
 The embedding-based (Bordes et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2018; Lacroix et al., 2018) often achieves a high score by fitting data using various neural network techniques but lacks interpretability.
 However, as shown in fig.  1(a), the equivalent perturbation, i.g,, the crafted adversarial perturbation, is still δ and this strategy is easy to be adaptively evaded since the randomness of x0 w.t x0 is local (Athalye et al., 2018).
 However, it remains unclear how the independence constraint affects other properties of representation.
 We believe that part of the reason for this shortcoming is a lack of realistic benchmarks that comprehensively measure this aspect of learning in realistic scenarios.
 Among the previously proposed defenses, the adversarial training (AT) methods can achieve state-of-the-art robustness under different adversarial settings (Madry et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019b).
 One of the leading results along these lines has been by Saxe et al., (2013), deriving an analytical solution for the gradient flow dynamics of deep linear networks and showing that for such models, the singular values converge at different rates, with larger values converging first.
 While the variational bound makes it feasible to train (approximate) information bottleneck layers with deep neural networks, the encoder in these networks – the layer that predicts the bottleneck variable distribution conditioned on the input – must still process the full input, before it is compressed and irrelevant information is removed.
Broadly, an arrow of time can be thought of as a function that monotonously increases as a system evolves in time.
 The robustness of adversarial training fails to generalize on unseen testing data.
While these more complex deep neural network architectures achieved better results, they also kept their learnt features hidden if not further analyzed.
 Pearl (2009) demonstrates that, in general, causal relationships can only be learned by experimentation (on-line exploration), or running a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), where the treatment assignment does not depend on the individual X – see Figure 1(a).
In this paper we show how recent developments in eigenfunction estimation of the Laplacian (Wu et al., 2019) can be used to extend a principled approach for option discovery (Jinnai et al., 2019b) to the non-linear function approximation case.
 While for the VAEs, the encoder is used to map the data distribution to a Gaussian latent distribution, which is then mapped back to the data distribution by the decoder.
 This is a simple 3-way relationship between entities i, j, k that is complex to represent as a system of 2-way relationships.
 It may be expensive to collect more demonstrations to resolve such ambiguities, and even when we can, it may not be obvious to a human demonstrator where the agent’s difficulty is arising from.
 Thus, MOT in the visual∗Equal contributionperception of autonomous driving poses a general challenge to existing attack techniques that blindly target objection detection.
 Some methods estimate the noise transition matrix and use it to correct the loss function (Patrini et al., 2017; Goldberger & Ben-Reuven, 2017).
adversarial training has been demonstrated to be the most effective (Athalye et al., 2018).
 Like MPO, rather than directly updating the parameters in the direction of the policy gradient, V-MPO first constructs a target distribution for the policy update subject to a sample-based KL constraint, then calculates the gradient that partially moves the parameters toward that target, again subject to a KL constraint.
 Hence, on-device processing encounters a dilemma, i.g,while we expect intermediate-layer features to yield high accuracy, we certainly would not want sensitive information to be leaked.
 The popularity of SGD+Nesterov is tied to the well-known acceleration of the deterministic Nesterov’s method over gradient descent (15).
 Recent papers have shown performance competitive with supervised learning by learning complex neural networks on very large image datasets.
Current state-of-the-art unsupervised disentanglement approaches enrich the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) objective with different unsupervised regularizers that aim to encourage disentangled representations (Higgins et al., 2017a; Burgess et al., 2018; Kim & Mnih, 2018; Chen et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2018; Rubenstein et al., 2018; Mathieu et al., 2018; Rolinek et al., 2019).
A rather obvious strategy to perform OOD detection in the absence of labels (and even in the presence of them) is to learn a density modelM that approximates the true distribution p∗(X ) of training inputs x ∈ X (Bishop, 1994).
Our contributions are two-fold.
 In theory, given enough data and the right training procedure, a universal network will be able to solve any task that it is presented with.
 It is desired to preserve as much knowledge as possible in the learned model and not to rely on the availability of the data.
 But self-play is only possible in symmetric two-player games.
 We also investigate token identifiability, as the fine-grained, word-level mappings between input and output generated by the model.
 Among them, random shooting algorithms (RS), which uses modelpredictive control (MPC), is shown to have good robustness and scalability (Richards, 2005).
 See Figure 1a for an illustration of the false extrapolation in a toy environment.
 We consider the simplest case: on-policy discounted value estimation.
 In computer vision, low-level patterns (such as edges) and their corresponding representations can be shared across tasks.
 For example, all the popular variants of adaptive stochastic gradient methods like Adam (Kingma & Ba (2015)) or AMSGrad (Reddi et al., (2018b)) include the use of momentum.
 For example, in autonomous driving pedestrians and other drivers can take actions in the world that affect the camera image, but only in a physically realistic fashion.
 This provides an appealing mechanism for building models that have a rich understanding of the physical world, without any labeled examples.
Aiming to bestow GCNs with theoretical guarantees, one promising research direction is to study graph scattering transforms (GSTs).
 Logan et al., (2019) and Petroni et al., (2019) further validate this hypothesis through a zero-shot fact completion task that involves single-token entities, showing that pretrained models achieve much better performance than random guessing and can be on par with specifically-trained relation extraction models.
 However, this is often difficult due to the nature of deep neural networks.
 Traditional models for solving these tasks memorize historical access patterns and branch history to make predictions about the future.
 Zhang et al., (2019) and Li et al., (2019) adopted pre-defined network-level patterns of spatial resolution, and searched for operators and decoders with latency constraint.
In this paper, we propose a general framework called difference-seeking generative adversarial network (DSGAN), to generate a variety of unseen data.
 Compared with misclassification rate and its corresponding surrogate loss, AUC is more suitable for imbalanced data setting (Elkan, 2001).
 However, such approaches depend on a particular (class of) attack method.
 One potential path forward is to detect adversarial inputs, instead of attempting to accurately classify them (Schott et al., 2018; Roth et al., 2019).
 While training robust classifiers focuses on maintaining performance in presence of adversarial examples, adversarial detection only cares for detecting such examples.
 One simple, straightforward solution is to include a history of raw observations in the current “observation” (McCallum, 1993; Lee et al., 2019).
 Once all policies in the population are evaluated, we can use information of the best policy to enhance the performance.
 These mappings are usually referred to as ‘emergent language’.
A major problem of the transfer-based attack is that it can not achieve very high success rate.
A significant problem with this methodology is the apparent contradiction between the enormous size and high dimensionality of natural image manifold and the limited scale of affordable testing (i.g,, human labeling, or verifying predicted labels, which is expensive and time consuming).
 We illustrate mixout(u) in Figure 1.
 This poses the exploration-exploitation dilemma: whether to act to gain new information (explore) or to act consistently with past experience to maximize reward (exploit).
The resulting algorithm is implemented with a simplified convolutional neural network architecture illustrated in Figure 1.
Although a variety of model compression heuristics have been successfully applied to different neural network models, such as Jacob et al., (2018); Han et al., (2015); Alvarez & Salzmann (2017), these approaches generally lack strong provable guarantees on the trade-off between the compression rate and the approximation error.
1 It is however not fully understood that under what conditions poor local minima may have positive curvature.
Recent works that advocate GNNs for modeling multi-object dynamics mostly make use of GNNs in an autoregressive (AR) fashion.
Challenges of Distributed SGD in PS.
 Later, Foerster et al., (2018) proposed Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients (COMA) motivated from the difference reward mechanism (Wolpert & Tumer, 2001) to address the challenges of multiagent credit assignment.
 The characters are extracted, and each is associated with a sequence of displacements.
 However, such small-loss examples may be corrupted, particularly under a high level of noise.
 However, the downside of learning such an identifiable model within the VAE framework lies in the intractability of KL divergence between the approximate posterior and the true posterior.
In many applications such as recommender systems, web search, and image classification cloud service (Clarifai; Google Cloud Vision), top-k predictions are more relevant.
 This is because deep RL algorithms do not pay special attention to the initialisation of the neural networks and instead use common initialisation schemes that yield initial Q-values around zero.
 The task-specific model may well suffer from overfitting when the data for the target task is scarce.
 In effect, this consumes large model capacity and data modes (Shelhamer et al., 2019).
 Data uncertainty is the irreducible uncertainty in predictions which arises due to the complexity, multi-modality and noise in the data.
 This shortcoming is magnified in non-dedicated1 environments such as cloud computing.
 Extrapolations moreover likely support adaptability to environmental changes and robust decision making (Dvornik et al., 2018).
 Specifically, the Siamese network models distance dX : X × X → R+ on domain X by learning embedding φ : X → Rn and computing dX (x, y) as ‖φ(x)− φ(y)‖2.
In this work we circle back to the fundamental question: what is the (functional) relation between generalization error and model and dataset sizes? Critically, we capitalize on the concept of model scaling in its strictest form: we consider the case where there is some given scaling policy that completely defines how to scale up a model from small to large scales.
 While this approach can be effective, it requires training data pairing natural-language questions with structured queries, which is difficult to obtain.
 However, these approaches often struggle to learn complex, real-world loop invariants.
NAS methods have been typically decomposed into three components (Elsken et al., 2019; Li & Talwalkar, 2019): search space, search strategy and model evaluation strategy.
 In addition, videos can provide an abundant and virtually unlimited source of visual information.
 Also, in ordinal regression (Frank & Hall, 2001; Li & Lin, 2007), to predict the rank of an object, binary classifications are performed to tell whether the rank is higher than a series of thresholds or not.
 One related task is natural language inference, which requires models to label the logical relationships of sentence pairs.
 While the quality of generated examples can provide significant convincing evidence that a generative model is flexible enough to capture the variability in the data distribution, it is far from a formal guarantee that the representation is fit for other purposes.
 VAEs promise theoretically well-founded and more stable training than Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and more efficient sampling mechanisms than autoregressive models (Larochelle & Murray, 2011; Germain et al., 2015).
 However, previous works rely on the prior knowledge for classification task, either inheriting the backbone for classification, or designing search space similar to NAS on classification.
 We found that directly applying common visualization techniques to RL agents often leads to poor results.
 These architectures effectively combine node features and graph topology to build distributed node representations.
 Thus, the distance from initialization may be expected to be significantly smaller than the magnitude of the weights.
 To address this limitation, various of adaptive gradient methods, such as Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011), RMSprop (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012) and Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012) have been proposed to exploit the geometry of historical data.
 Examples include models of energy demand, climate analysis, financial market, or user-behavior analytics (Ditzler et al., 2015).
 We show this empirically in controlled synthetic scenarios, and also demonstrate significant performance improvement on a variety of challenging, large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) and sequence modelling tasks when a conceptually simple multiplicative interaction module is incorporated.
 They rectified this problem with the introduction of a novel injective neighborhood aggregation scheme, making it as strong as the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test (Weisfeiler & Leman, 1968).
 Rather than having a human expert handcrafting a reward function for learning the desired policy, the imitation learning approach only requires the human expert to demonstrate the desired policy, and then the intelligent agent (a.k.a. learner) learns to match the demonstration.
 Transfer learning has been widely used in practice Rezaei & Liu (2019c), including applications such as face recognition Parkhi et al., (2015), text-to-speech synthesis Jia et al., (2018), encrypted traffic classification Rezaei & Liu (2019a), and skin cancer detection Esteva et al., (2017).
 On the one hand, the datasets pave the way to the recent research on knowledge-grounded response generation/selection (Zhao et al., 2019; Lian et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019); on the other hand, we argue that there still a long way to go for application of the existing models in real scenarios, since (1) the models, especially those achieve state-of-the-art performance via sophisticated neural architectures, just overfit to the small training data (e.g, ∼ 18k dialogues).
 Panning at arbitrary camera positions allows our proposed model to adjust the baseline (distance between cameras) for different levels of 3D sensation.
 However, ad hoc tree-structured models (Socher et al., 2013; Tai et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2018) often operate on recursive or recurrent mechanisms, which are not parallelizable, thus hindering their application in larger-scale training.
Because the NTK is asymptotically constant (Jacot et al., 2018), these results apply at initialization, during training and at convergence.
Mean-field game is proposed by Huang et al., (2003; 2006); Lasry and Lions (2006a;b; 2007) with the idea of utilizing mean-field approximation to model the strategic interactions within a large population.
 The first approach, the certification of neural networks, trains a verified network that satisfies given properties, e.g, a network that is guaranteed to be robust to adversarial perturbations (Wong & Kolter, 2018; Dvijotham et al., 2018; Raghunathan et al., 2018; Mirman et al., 2018).
 However, in contrast to GANs, where finding the right balance between generator and critic is difficult, training is simpler for MMD-nets because using the kernel trick the MMD can be estimated without the need to numerically optimize over the critic function.
 For example, consider the problem of synthesizing a program from a small set of input-output examples.
 Meanwhile, simply averaging the prediction scores of all clips could be sub-optimal during inference.
 Some platforms perform forensic photo analysis at the ingress (Truepic, 2019), but it may already be too late.
 Similar phenomena are observed in other scenarios like BERT (a bidirectional transformer language model) pre-training (Devlin et al., 2019).
In this paper, we aim to address these challenges by introducing dynamical distance learning (DDL), a general method for learning distance functions that can provide effective shaping for goal-reaching tasks without manual engineering.
 In each episode, a task is drawn from some population and a limited amount of support and query data from that task is made available.
 GLIDER achieves this by first utilizing our ongoing work on Neural Interaction Detection (NID) (Tsang et al., 2017) with a data-instance perturbation method called LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016) over a batch of data samples.
 Interestingly, however, state-of-the-art methods for generating realistic images do not account for this discrete structure (Brock et al., 2018; Parmar et al., 2018).
 Evaluating generated samples remains challenging (Liu et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2017), but Cı́fka et al., (2018) recommends assessing generated samples along two dimensions: 1) the quality of each sentence; 2) the diversity across sentences.
 However, no similar regularization is imposed to enforce the correspondence between outputs and latent codes, so that the network is prone to ignore input latent codes in training, and produce identical images from an input condition even with different latent codes.
 We would like a mapping for each quantized layer that maximizes task performance, but it remains an open question how to optimally achieve this.
In this paper, we explore the degree to which you can navigate the visual world of a GAN.
 (ii) Class imbalance in the data is typically extreme.
 Central to their approaches is estimating the gradient.
 †Part of the work was done while MK was a sabbatical visitor of the DASH Center at the University of Southern California, United States.
We note that resource-constrained training already is implicitly widespread, as the vast majority of practitioners have access to limited compute.
 Addressing the problem of efficient approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (NNS) (Jegou et al., 2011) or Maximum Inner-Product Search (MIPS) (Shrivastava and Li, 2014) is thus an active area of research, which we review in brief in the related work section.
 Although a diminishing stepsize or very small constant stepsize can reduce the variance Bhandari et al., (2018); Srikant and Ying (2019), they also slow down the convergence significantly.
 Imitation learning can then be framed as learning a behavior policy which minimizes a divergence between this target distribution and the state-action distribution induced by the behavior policy interacting with the environment.
 The outer loop (in the spirit of meta-learning) aims to find an effective meta-initialization, from which the inner loop can perform efficient adaptation – optimize parameters to solve new tasks with very few labelled examples.
 1n √√√√ n∑ i=1 ( classifier norm γi )2 + low order terms (1.1)For deeper models, the relationship between output margin and generalization is unfortunately less clear and interpretable.
 However, these decoding strategies do not address the core issue: the model’s underlying sequence probabilities are clearly not correct.
 Battenberg et al., (2019) and Hsu et al., (2018) have shown that it is possible to use latent variable models to discover features such as speaking style, speaking rate, arousal, gender and even the quality of the recording environment.
 Recently, simple (but computationally expensive) ensembling methods (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017), which train many models on the same data from different random seeds, have proven highly effective at uncertainty quantification tasks (Ovadia et al., 2019).
 For example, during the training phase, the training data can be corrupted with a designated trigger pattern associated with a target label to implant a backdoor for trojan attack on DNNs (Gu et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018).
Meanwhile, in many settings amenable to meta-learning, it is crucial to ensure that sensitive information in each task’s dataset stays private.
 Specifically, two datasets have emerged as de facto benchmarks for few-shot learning: Omniglot (Lake et al., 2015), and mini-ImageNet (Vinyals et al., 2016), and we believe that both of them are approaching their limit in terms of allowing one to discriminate between the merits of different approaches.
 In open-domain question answering, q represents a question and d represents an evidence passage containing the answer (Chen et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019).
 MBRL can adapt to new tasks specified through reward functions (Kuvayev & Sutton, 1996; Deisenroth & Rasmussen, 2011).
 Furthermore, the conceptual difference between attaining one’s own goal and cooperating for others’ success calls for Work done at HRImore modularized and targeted approaches.
 The goal of this work is advance our understanding of deep-learning models for denoising.
 In this setting, although gradient (of output probability to the input layer) is not computable, it can still be estimated using finite differences, and algorithms many attacks are based on this (Chen et al., 2017; Ilyas et al., 2018a; Tu et al., 2019; Jun et al., 2018).
Since the general objective is to unleash new possibilities by developing automatic optimization passes, long compilation time hinders innovation and could put the current solutions in a position of questionable utility.
 Recently, Mély et al., (2018) proposed a cortical circuit, constrained by physiology of primate visual cortex (V1), that offers a unified explanation for contextual illusions across visual domains – from the orientation-tilt illusion to color induction.
 Specifically, we explore the role of compositionality and locality (Tokmakov et al., 2018; Stone et al., 2017) as two principles that lead to good generalization.
 More precisely, sequence-level knowledge distillation (Kim & Rush, 2016) – a special variant of the original approach – is applied during NAT model training by replacing the target side of training samples with the outputs from a pre-trained AT model trained on the same corpus with a roughly equal number of parameters.
Backdoor attacks on FL have been recently studied in (Bagdasaryan et al., 2018; Bhagoji et al., 2019).
These challenges are typically addressed either by making simplifying assumptions about the distributions of the parameters and activations, or by using sampling-based approaches, which are expensive and unreliable (likely to overestimate the uncertainties in predictions).
 In the general case, a new approach would need to be uniformly better than existing normalization methods, which has proven difficult.
 They are attracting increasing attention for solving ML problems in the black-box setting or when computing gradients is too expensive (Liu et al., 2018a).
 However, synchronizing thousands of workers introduces significant overhead (the parameter server must wait for the slowest worker, which can be costly as the number of workers grows).
 Then, this approach rescales these confidence estimates based on a validation dataset to improve their “calibration”.
 In some cases, quantization may even improve model generalization by acting as a form of regularization.
 These modules are designed to perform basic reasoning tasks and can be composed to perform complex reasoning over unstructured knowledge.
 In this work, the function is approximated with a small multilayer perceptron.
 The latent representation of VHE can be sampled from either the variational posterior provided∗Corresponding authorby the image encoder given an image input, or the posterior of the text decoder via MCMC given a text input.
 As shown in Figure 1, we get the architecture-0 on a given dataset using a NAS method.
 The agent needs to thus reason about the complexities of such a world solely through the textual descriptions that it receives, descriptions that are often incomplete.
 This procedure of learning dynamics can then be used in conjunction with a plethora of decision-making techniques, ranging from optimal control to reinforcement learning (RL) (Watter et al., 2015; Banijamali et al., 2018; Finn et al., 2016; Chua et al., 2018; Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018; Kaiser et al., 2019; Hafner et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019).
Many classical algorithms share related subroutines: for example, shortest path computation (via the Bellman-Ford (Bellman, 1958) algorithm) and breadth-first search both must enumerate sets of edges adjacent to a particular node.
Weight sharing has been proved to be an effective way of reducing the parameter space of CNNs.
 Most of the existing GCN based approaches for handling relational graphs (Marcheggiani & Titov, 2017; Schlichtkrull et al., 2017) suffer from overparameterization and are limited to learning only node representations.
 A CGM can be best estimated when given interventional data, but interventions are often costly or impossible to obtained.
 Indeed, the motivation is to address the following question:How does the update of weights using SGD at an input x and its label y impact the prediction of the neural networks at another input x′ ?Taking this dynamic perspective, we make the following three contributions.
 Thus, trees that achieve good accuracy on a randomized dataset are much larger than those on a real dataset (e.g, Chatterjee & Mishchenko (2019, Expt. 5)).
Interestingly, it has been shown that the hippocampus is storing memories independently of each other through a process called pattern separation (Yassa & Stark, 2011; Marr et al., 1991).
 Recent approaches propose open-vocabulary models that can generate the candidates, especially for slots such as entity names and time, from the dialogue history (Lei et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019).
Rosenblatt (1962), on whose work we draw inspiration from, introduced continuous-time RNN (CTRNN) to mimic activation propagation in neural circuitry.
To provide a unified framework for understanding the changes the network undergoes during the early phase, we employ the methodology of iterative magnitude pruning with rewinding (IMP), as detailed below, throughout the bulk of this work (Frankle & Carbin, 2019; Frankle et al., 2019).
To address such issues, many modified normalization methods have been proposed.
 Since the communication between servers may cause service latency, it would be desirable to design communication strategies without communicating too much.
 Adversarial machine learning aims to develop novel attack methods which perturb the input minimally while changing the ANN’s classification outcome (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., (2016); Carlini & Wagner (2017); Goodfellow et al., (2014); Athalye et al., (2017); Nguyen et al., (2015)) as well as to design defense mechanisms which prevent these attacks from affecting ANN behavior (Papernot et al., (2016b); Goodfellow et al., (2014); Huang et al., (2015), see Yuan et al., (2019) for review).
 Beyond landscape analysis, another research direction aims to establish convergence guarantees for optimization algorithms (e.g, GD, SGD) for training deep linear networks.
 Specifically, we propose a feedforward layer for deep neural networks that is suitable for neuroimaging and potentially useful for other data where variables can be grouped due to underlying structure.
 Then, a “student” model is trained with this new training set to yield the final model.
 However, there is limited literature on the statistical methodology of the highly multivariate spatial point processes, according to the very recent paper (Choiruddin et al., 2019).
 While there has been some prior work on inferring type annotations for TypeScript using machine learning (Hellendoorn et al., 2018; Raychev et al., 2015), prior work in this space has several shortcomings.
We believe, however, that it is impossible to perfectly reconstruct all the attributes in the image of a person’s face through the characteristics of the voice alone.
 We infer a mental representation of the world that is 3-dimensional, in which the objects are distinct, have 3D extent, occlude one another, and so on.
 To address this issue and to improve performance across all classes, one can re-sample the data or design specific loss functions that better facilitate learning with imbalanced data (Chawla et al., 2002; Cui et al., 2019; Cao et al., 2019).
 This is because the training environment is not necessarily a very good model of the perturbations that an agent may actually face, leading to potentially unwanted, sub-optimal behaviour.
 An alternative is to freeze the most important parameters and allow future tasks to only adapt the remaining parameters to new tasks (Mallya & Lazebnik, 2018).
 Zhang et al., (2017) show that DNNs can even fully memorize samples with incorrectly corrupted labels.
 But direct inspection of data may be audited or disallowed by policy in some settings.
Ensembles of neural networks benefit from the above observation to achieve better performance by averaging or majority voting on the output of each ensemble member (Xie et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017).
 For this reason, a temporal dimension is added to the neuron activities.
 These large widths far exceed what is used empirically, constituting a significant gap between theory and practice.
Prior knowledge related to physics equations has been combined with data-driven models for various purposes.
 This implementation makes use of asymmetric numeral systems (ANS), a last-in-first-out (LIFO) entropy coding scheme (Duda, 2009).
 At the same time, we propose a novel method to stabilize agents in distributed asynchronous setups and, through our ablation studies, show how the agent can learn in both a time and sample efficient manner.
 Thus giving higher likelihoods to target sequences does not guarantee the model to generate sequences close to the target or good sequences.
 Indeed, these stabilization techniques have proven essential to achieving the latest state-of-the-art results (Karras et al., 2018; Brock et al., 2019).
 Another approach is to use propensity scores as importance weights, so that we could use the weighted average of rewards in off-policy data as a suitable estimate of the average reward of the target policy.
 Having shown that the graph convolution is a type of Laplacian smoothing, they proved that after repeatedly applying Laplacian smoothing many times, the features of the nodes in the (connected) graph would converge to similar values—the issue coined as “oversmoothing”.
 For instance, training ResNet-34 with early stopping can achieve 84% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 even when 60% of the training labels are corrupted (Table 1).
We suppose that images result from underlying factors of variation such as the presence of objects, their relative positions or the lighting of the scene.
 Here, by leveraging a generalization of the Hamiltonian dynamics, we develop a learning framework which exploits the underlying physics in the associated computation graph.
 In attempts to recover the sparse signals X , these existing work adopt an `0- or `1-penalty function to promote the underlying sparsity and give various optimization algorithms for the resulting objectives (some of those are heuristics while a few others have theoretical convergence guarantees).
 Past work has looked at analyzing the energy signal from the home utility meter to detect when certain appliances are on.
 In theory, the expressive power of the linearized model is roughly the same as, and thus limited to, that of the corresponding random feature space (Allen-Zhu et al., 2018a; Wei et al., 2019) or the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) (Bietti & Mairal, 2019).
 Such tabular representation limits the method from being directly applied to large games.
However, given the way that multilingual BERT was pre-trained, it is unclear why we should expect such high zero-shot performance.
 For RL systems, saliency maps are often used to assess an agent’s internal representations and behavior over multiple frames in the environment, rather than to assess the importance of specific pixels in classifying images.
 However, regardless of what other features these approaches use, such as conditioning on program traces (Shin et al., 2018; Ellis & Gulwani, 2017; Chen et al., 2019) or pre-training on the input data (Singh, 2016), they are limited by the fact that their models are conditioned on the initial, limited user specification.
 In particular, ODE-Nets are memory efficient but time inefficient.
 High strength and low correlation are important properties to minimize the generalization error of a random forest.
The common practice of fine-tuning is to adopt the default hyperparameters for training large models while using smaller initial learning rate and shorter learning rate schedule.
 SD led the project, implemented the PPLM, set up and ran all modeling experiments, engineered how to obtain workable gradients via the weighted embedding approach, and made the model work.
Recently, 3D representation learning through 3D object generation has been actively researched.
 Consequently, they fail drastically when evaluated on samples without these spurious cues (Jia & Liang, 2017; Poliak et al., 2018; Gururangan et al., 2018; Niven & Kao, 2019).
 While several effective defenses that employ adversarial examples have emerged (Qin et al., 2019; Shafahi et al., 2019), generating strong adversarial training examples adds non-trivial computational burden on the training process (Kannan et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2019).
 The former can be zero (e.g, asymptotically for an unbiased estimator), yet the latter could be arbitrarily large.
To deal with these obstacles, recent work has proposed the randomized smoothing strategy for verifying the robustness of classifiers.
Representational knowledge is structured – the dimensions exhibit complex interdependencies.
 Such methods rely heavily on a human-constructed dataset, which is time- and labor-consuming.
 However, the computing cost is huge for training and evaluating thousands of sampled policies in the search process.
 The same method could be also applied to the latent feature space, to achieve even larger performance gain (Verma et al., 2019).
 Anti-discrimination laws imposed by many countries evaluate fairness by notions such as disparate treatment and disparate impact.
Optimal transport (OT) is a principled analytical framework to align heterogeneous datasets (Santambrogio, 2015).
 By cheapening each block equally, one relies on the assumption that each block is of equal importance.
 In these domains not only do annotators disagree with each other, but they often even disagree with themselves (Gulshan et al., 2016; Hansegard et al., 2009).
 To build robust disentangled representation learning methods that do not require large amounts of supervised data, recent work has turned to forms of weak supervision (Chen & Batmanghelich, 2019; Gabbay & Hoshen, 2019).
 Under the black-box setting, most existing attacks fail to generate robust adversarial examples against defense models.
 Others have proposed more direct empirical ways to characterize generalization of deep networks without attempting to deriving bounds (Keskar et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2017).
 In the robustness verification problem, S = {x | ‖x−x0‖p ≤ } is defined as some small `p-ball around the original example x0, and setting up c = 1y0 − 1y enables us to verify whether the logit output of class y0 is always greater than another class y for any input within S.
 These models enjoy small number of parameters, low memory footprint and computational efficiency along with high empirical expressiveness.
 For convenience, we will assume the same batch size B per worker.
 As a step in that direction, we explore the solution space of the CycleGAN in the subsequent sections of this paper.
 However, GDA is known to suffer from two drawbacks.
 In this general CL, not only is explicit task definition unavailable but also the data distribution gradually shifts without a clear task boundary.
 In the opposite direction, structural representations→ node embeddings, graph neural networks (GNNs) are often optimized to predict edges even though their structural node representations are provably incapable of performing the task.
 The identity function represents perfect calibration.
 Consider a movie recommender system, for instance.
 Over-fitting comes from the case when we utilize an over-parametric model to fit a distribution with limited training data, where the model we learn fits the training data very well but generalizes poorly to the testing data.
 For example, they are successful for the style transfer tasks mapping local texture (e.g, photo2vangogh and photo2portrait) but are typically unsuccessful for image translation tasks with larger shape change (e.g, selfie2anime and cat2dog) in wild images.
This general idea is commonly encapsulated in the terms conditional computing (Bengio, 2013) or gating architectures (Sigaud et al., 2016).
 Recent literature (Devon Hjelm et al., 2019; van den Oord et al., 2018) has focused on the InfoMax objective maximizing I(x, z) instead of minimizing it, to guarantee that all the predictive information is retained by the representation, but doing nothing to discard the irrelevant information.
CS methods however lack in the sense that they do not (under a given data distribution) focus solely on the information required to solve the downstream task of interest, such as disease prediction or semantic segmentation.
 Differential privacy has been proposed to “hide” certain input data from the output; that is, by looking at the statistical results calculated from input data, one cannot tell whether the input data contain a certain record or not.
 These decisions are typically made in either one or two passes in the compiler.
 This lead to their design of an end-to-end trained neural network based policy that processed raw sensory observations to directly output actions that the agent should execute.
 A few examples of adversarial attacks that have been successfully applied to various DNN models are the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) (Goodfellow et al., (2014)), Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) (Papernot et al., (2015)), Carlini-Wagner (CW) (Carlini & Wagner (2016)) and the Basic Iterative Method (BIM) (Kurakin et al., (2016)).
 This leads to a disentanglement with respect to the pose and together with the group structure this enables a flexible way of learning high level representations in terms of low-level activated neurons observed in specific configurations, which we conceptually illustrate in fig. 1.
 Selfsupervised learning methods have gained in popularity recently, being used for tasks such as depth regression (Guizilini et al., 2019), tracking (Vondrick et al., 2018) and representation learning (Wang et al., 2019; Kolesnikov et al., 2019).
 This has the advantage of making the network robust to subsequent pruning.
 We study a range of aspects on two different NLP tasks, in order to identify the key components in the success of the model.
 In scenemixture models (Greff et al., 2017; 2019; Burgess et al., 2019; Engelcke et al., 2019), a visual scene is explained by a mixture of a finite number of component images.
 Usually, we are interested in a low-dimensional (K n) embedding of graphs with n nodes as it is always possible to find an embedding 32 with L∞ norm with no distortion in an n-dimensional Euclidean space.
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently gained increasing popularity for addressing many graph related problems effectively (Dai et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; Kipf & Welling, 2017; Schlichtkrull et al., 2018).
 Under these conditions, an MPC controller will effectively control a system, up to a certain accuracy, provided that uncertainties in the model dynamics are limited (Limon et al., 2009).
 However, both these algorithms are restrictive with respect to the used compression operators, only allowing for unbiased compressors and—more significantly— so far not supporting arbitrarily high compression ratios.
Since the agents have discrete actions in Atari games (Huang et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2017), the problem of attacking Atari agents often reduces to the problem of finding adversarial examples on image classifiers, also pointed out in (Huang et al., 2017), where the adversaries intend to craft the input perturbations that would drive agent’s new action to deviate from its nominal action.
Inspired by its capacity to learn meaningful inter-dependencies between words, researchers have recently considered utilizing self-attention in vision tasks.
 This approach can effectively avoid the exponentially high variance compared to the more classic importance sampling (IS) estimation methods (pre; Dudı́k et al., 2011; Hirano et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2017; Murphy et al., 2001), especially for infinite-horizon policy evaluation (Liu et al., 2018; Nachum et al., 2019; Hallak & Mannor, 2017).
 This process is illustrated in figure 1; note that the aggregate agent, outlined in gray, has the standard interface of an RL agent.
 1.Sparse rewards induce a difficult exploration problem, which is a challenge for many state of the art RL methods.
A important distinction to make is whether a task is solved in a transductive or inductive manner, that is, whether xt is used.
In this work, we analyze conditional generative models by assessing them on a spectrum of robustness tasks.
There are multiple settings for disentanglement.
Motivated by these observations, a range of recent methods learn representations in different spaces of constant curvatures: spherical or elliptical (Batmanghelich et al., 2016), hyperbolic (Nickel & Kiela, 2017; Sala et al., 2018; Tifrea et al., 2019) and even in products of these spaces (Gu et al., 2019; Bachmann et al., 2020).
∗Work done as an intern at Google.
Despite of the large array of adversarial attacks proposed in the literature, many of them are whitebox approaches that assume full access to the target model architecture and the ability of performing back-propagation to get gradient information (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016; Kurakin et al., 2016; Gu & Rigazio, 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2018; Carlini & Wagner, 2017).
 Recent work in Meta RL (Hochreiter et al., 2001; Duan et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Finn et al., 2017) (especially in few-shot learning settings) has attempted to have the agents implicitly infer tasks and quickly adapt to them.
 While ordinary reconstruction-based methods carry out novelty detection by comparing differences between input data before the input layer and reconstructed data at the output layer, RAPP extends these comparisons to hidden spaces.
 As E (2017) notes, there exists a mathematical equivalence between the forward data propagation on a neural network and the temporal evolution of a dynamic system.
 However, it does not make the most of underlying language structures.
But how far are we from training binary neural networks that are powerful enough to become a viable alternative to real-valued networks? Our first contribution in this work is to take stock of recent advances on binary neural networks and train a very strong baseline which already results in state-of-the-art performance.
 However, to answer the full question, we need to consider the full range of β.
 Tan & Le (2019a) propose to search the scaling factor of image resolution, channel multiplier and layer numbers in scenarios with different computation budgets.
 This method gradually tracks a neural network’s (close-to-)optimal parameters from one data distribution to another one via the homotopy method (Allgower & Georg, 1980) and can be interpreted as a generalization of the very common heuristic of fine-tuning a pre-trained network.
Recently, there has been a revival of methods in unsupervised representation learning based on MI.
 Automatic neural architecture search (Zoph & Le, 2017; So et al., 2019) is a choice for high accuracy model design, but the massive searching cost raises much concern (Figure 1b).
 Understanding learning with overparameterized (virtually infinite) networks thus rests on understanding this “representational cost”, which is the subject of our paper.
 Since then, several variants of gradient norm penalization have been introduced (Petzka et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2018; Adler and Lunz, 2018; Zhou et al., 2019b).
 Continual language learning is an open question which has not been studied extensively in machine learning and NLP domains.
Although state-of-the-art BC and IRL methods have demonstrated compelling performance in standard imitation learning settings, e.g, control tasks (Ho & Ermon, 2016; Fu et al.,; Qureshi et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2019) and video games (Aytar et al., 2018b), these approaches are developed based on a strong assumption: the expert and the imitator share the same dynamics model; specifically, they have the same action space, and any feasible state-action pair leads to the same next state in probability for both agents.
 We choose to study the zero-shot learning problem on 3D shape data instead of 2D image data, because part-level similarity across object categories in 3D is more salient and less affected by various distortions introduced in the imaging process.
 Therefore, exploring diverse adversarial examples, especially those with “unrestricted" magnitude of perturbation has acquired a lot of attention in both academia and industries (Brown et al., 2018).
 Most successful interventions fall into two categories, normalization and regularization.
Among a few methods that have been proposed for unsupervised learning of object-oriented representation in temporal scenes, SQAIR (Kosiorek et al., 2018) is by far the most complete model.
 The attacks have also been shown to be highly effective at replicating pay-per-query image prediction APIs, for as little as $30 (Orekondy et al., 2019).
 A better approach is to allow domains to undergo different transformations to arrive at domain-invariant features.
 However, this paradigm cannot be as easily applied to modeling periodic quantities, such as the orientation of an object.
 Among these, the most popular and successful approach is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (LeCun et al., 1989), which incorporates equivariance to translation via convolution.
 A second possibility is to use the straight through estimator (STE) (Bengio et al., 2013).
 Improving the signal-to-noise ratio in negative sampling while still enabling cheap gradients would dramatically enhance the speed of convergence.
Furthermore, experiments in NAS can be computationally extremely costly, making it virtually impossible to perform proper scientific evaluations with many repeated runs to draw statistically robust conclusions.
 Deep ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017), one of the most popular methods available for uncertainty estimation in deep networks today, struggle with this requirement.
 A number of recent works have sought to shed light on the effective representational properties of recurrent networks trained in practice.
 We showcase this inadvertence in Figure 1: here FID and KID are insensitive to the global structure of the data distribution.
 As a result, an adversary who wishes to have the benefits of such DL systems without incurring the costs has an incentive to steal them.
 Consequently, there has been several works over the past few years that propose different learning algorithms or learning rules for implementing deep convolutional SNNs for complex visual recognition tasks (Wu et al., 2019; Hunsberger & Eliasmith, 2015; Cao et al., 2015).
 Recent work exploring monotonic attention variants for simultaneous translation include: hard monotonic attention (Raffel et al., 2017), monotonic chunkwise attention (MoChA) (Chiu & Raffel, 2018) and monotonic infinite lookback attention (MILk) (Arivazhagan et al., 2019).
As a step towards bridging this gap, we propose to make use of gradient-based features from a pretrained network, i.g,, gradients of the model parameters with respect to a task-specific loss given an input sample.
 For example, one regularization method, L2-SP (Li et al., 2018), penalizes the L2-distances of pretrained weights on the source dataset and the weights being trained on the target dataset.
Despite the simplicity, these conventional solvers suffer from critical shortcomings.
 However, for graph NNs, several papers have reported that node representations go indistinguishable (known as over-smoothing) and prediction performances severely degrade when we stack many layers (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Wu et al., 2019b; Li et al., 2018).
 Such a problem is critical in a variety of applications such as predicting the properties of molecular graphs in both drug discovery and material science Chen et al., (2019b;a).
 A gradient estimate e(S) is unbiased ifES e(S) = ∇θEx∼pθ(x)f(x).
 By using tools from neural density estimation (Bishop, 1994; Rezende & Mohamed, 2015), we can develop methods that have all of the above properties.
Adversarial examples can be crafted following either a white-box setting (the adversary has full access to the target model) or a black-box setting (the adversary has no information of the target model).
 Zhuosheng Zhang and Zuchao Li were internship research fellows at NICT when this work was done. Hai Zhao was partially supported by Key Projects of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U1836222 and No. 61733011).
 Despite the success of recognizing novel classes sampled from the same domain as in the training stage (e.g, , both training and testing are on mini-ImageNet classes), Chen et al., (Chen et al., 2019a) recently raise the issue that existing metric-based approaches often do not generalize well to categories from different domains.
 The commonly used strategies to overcome catastrophic forgetting include:1. selective synaptic plasticity to preserve learned knowledge (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Zenke et al., 2017; Aljundi et al., 2018; Chaudhry et al., 2018), which is rooted in the idea of homeostatic plasticity in neuroscience,2. additional neural resource allocation to learn new knowledge and preserve old knowledge, (Rusu et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2017; Li & Hoiem, 2017; Rannen et al., 2017; Schwarz et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019), which is similar to neurogenesis in the hippocampus,3. memory and experience replay (Rebuffi et al., 2017; Shin et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2019; Rostami et al., 2019), which is based on the well-established theory of complementary learning system (CLS) (McClelland et al., 1995).
However, it has long been empirically observed (Calders et al., 2009) and recently been proved (Zhao & Gordon, 2019) that fairness is often at odds with utility.
For this particular paper, we focus on the problem of storage assignment.
Two recent papers (Morris et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019) have started exploring the theoretical properties of GNNs by establishing a close connection between GNNs and the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test for checking graph isomorphism.
 Another observed phenomenon is that the local shape of the loss surface changes rapidly in the beginning of training (LeCun et al., 2012; Keskar et al., 2017; Achille et al., 2017; Jastrzebski et al., 2018; Fort & Ganguli, 2019).
To rough approximation, there are two distinct types of perceptual grouping routines that are associated with feedback computations.
In this work, we introduce network deconvolution, a method to reduce redundant correlation in images.
2 We focus on a standard suite of style transfer tasks, including formality transfer (Rao & Tetreault, 2018), author imitation (Xu et al., 2012), word decipherment (Shen et al., 2017), sentiment transfer (Shen et al., 2017), and related language translation (Pourdamghani & Knight, 2017).
 Bowen created the initial environment, infrastructure and models, and obtained the first results of sequential skill progression.
 While these NAS methods are methodically designed and show promising improvements, many setups in their algorithms are:
 Out-of-distribution prediction is common in real-world graph datasets, for example, when one wants to predict chemical properties of a brand-new, just synthesized molecule, which is different from all molecules synthesized so far, and thereby different from all molecules in the training set.
 We believe it brings several advantages for more engaging and accurate knowledge-based chit-chat.
 The API additionally includes tools to perform inference by numerically solving the ODEs corresponding to: continuous gradient descent, with-or-without momentum, on arbitrary loss functions, at finite or infinite time (§2.1, Figure 1, §B.4).
 This model is typically given by a Gaussian process (GP), whose well-calibrated uncertainty prediction allows for an informed explorationexploitation trade-off during optimization.
 Vocabulary sizes can reach d = 105 or 106 (Pennington et al., 2014), and dimensionality of the embeddings used in current systems ranges from p = 300 (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014) to p = 1024 (Devlin et al., 2018).
In this paper we propose a unique blend of cheap coarse-grained supervision in the form of rules and expensive fine-grained supervision in the form of labeled instances.
 Thus, GNNs lack the second and third terms of this equation and can only model them via complex higher-order interactions of messages.
Among several topics of deep learning theories, a generalization error analysis is one of the biggest issues in the machine learning literature.
 With the growth in the number of devices participating in the training, the synchronization becomes a prominent bottleneck.
This work extends this theory in a direction relevant for application to real-world data.
 As a result, ML practitioners currently hand-pick specific classes of structured linear maps for each of their applications.
 An empirically adopted practice is the so-called progressive pruning and training∗Correspondence should be addressed to: Zhangyang Wang and Yingyan Lin.
 But doing so has required researchers to make strong assumptions and study restricted model classes.
 In a vanilla language modeling objective, the target token is always the next token that follows the context.
 Permutation invariance is an essential requirement for any graph learning method.
 Unfortunately, these classical approaches are inapplicable when direct access to the environment is not available, which is often the case in practice.
 Federated averaging (FedAvg) is the first and perhaps the most widely used FL algorithm.
 However, sequence prediction has encountered the following series of problems due to MLE.
 Bunel et al., (2018) showed that many of the available methods can be viewed as instances of a unified BaB framework.
 After a couple of rounds of this mutual gating, the last updated x and hprev are fed to an LSTM.
 Recent work (Behrmann et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019) attempts to improve the discriminative performance of generative models by leveraging invertible architectures, but these methods still underperform their purely discriminative counterparts jointly trained as generative models.
Yet, theQ-value function is intrinsically induced by the underlying system dynamics.
Value Prediction: our experiments indicate that value networks successfully solve the supervised learning task they are trained on, but do not fit the true value function.
 We will specifically analyze the underpinnings of agent behavior—both cumulative reward, as well as more fine-grained algorithmic properties.
 Tasks with small number of training data, or close to the tasks trained in meta-training step may want to rely mostly on meta-knowledge obtained over other tasks, whereas tasks that are out-of-distribution or come with more number of training data may obtain better solutions when trained in a task-specific∗Equal contributionmanner.
 Although secondary structure can be determined by experimental assays (e.g, X-ray diffraction), it is slow, expensive and technically challenging.
 In the process, we provide a unified theoretical perspective on recent applications of autoencoders to label-embedding in static, high-dimensional classification problems (Yu et al., 2014; Girdhar et al., 2016; Yeh et al., 2017).
 Many large Transformer models can only realistically be trained in large industrial research laboratories and such models trained with model parallelism cannot even be fine-tuned on a single GPU as their memory requirements demand a multi-accelerator hardware setup even for a single training step.
 However, finding such novel self-organized patterns, and mapping the space of possible emergent patterns, has so far relied heavily on manual tuning of parameters and initial states.
 If an attribution heatmap highlights subjectively irrelevant areas, this might correctly reflectthe network\\u2019s unexpected way of processing the data, or the heatmap might be inaccurate (Nie et al., 2018; Viering et al., 2019; Sixt et al., 2019).
Capsule networks (Hinton et al., 2011), (Sabour et al., 2017) are a family of deep neural networks that aim to build such distributed, spatially-aware representations in a multi-class setting.
 GANs currently constitute one of the dominant paradigms for generative modelling of images, and they are able to produce high-fidelity samples∗Work done at DeepMind.
 Often, ideal solutions to prediction problems in such domains should be translation equivariant: if the data are translated in time or space, then the predictions should be translated correspondingly (Kondor & Trivedi, 2018; Cohen & Welling, 2016).
 However, these guarantees come at the cost of a significantly lower standard accuracy than models trained using adversarial training.
 Agnostic Federated Learning (AFL) (Mohri et al., 2019), as another variant of FedAvg, optimizes a centralized distribution that is a mixture of the client distributions.
 However, once learned, s/he can infer similar mechanisms in the lower level in Figure 1 without additional trials because human have a variety of priors including the concept of object, similarity, semantics, affordance, etc (Gibson, 2014; Dubey et al., 2018).
We propose Deep Reasoning Networks (DRNets), an end-to-end framework that combines deep learning with logical and constraint reasoning for solving unsupervised or very-weakly-supervised pattern de-mixing tasks.
 It is a non-convex composition optimizationminx ∑ t KL(p·|t ‖ q·|t) := ∑ t ∑ i pi|t log pi|t qi|t , (1.2)where pi|t and qi|t are the conditional probabilities w.r.p. {zi}ni=1 and {xi}ni=1,pi|t = d(zt,zi)∑ j 6=t d(zt,zj) , qi|t = d(xt,xi)∑ j 6=t d(xt,xj) ,where d(·, ·) is the dissimilar distance function between two samples.
 The work of SeyedMohsen Moosavi-Dezfooli (2019) showed that the smoothness of these decision boundaries and their curvature can play a vital role in network robustness.
 A second feature is discovering semantics from interactions — while solutions exist for semantic mapping and semantic SLAM Civera et al., (2011); Tateno et al., (2017), a more interesting problem arises when the semantics of objects and their affordances are not supervised, but defined through the task and thus learned from reward.
 Constructing semantics preserving adversarial examples would provide reliable adversarial training signals to robustify deep learning models, and make them generalize better.
Recently, great progress has been made towards robustness against anomalies when training DNNs (Krueger et al., 2017).
 That is the case of unsupervised pre-training (Erhan et al., 2010), multi-task learning (Caruana, 1998), convolutional layers (LeCun et al., 1990), batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) or adversarial training (Szegedy et al., 2013).
 To this end several solutions have recently been proposed that either reduce variance in unbiased estimators (Mnih & Gregor, 2014; Gu et al., 2015; Tucker et al., 2017; Rezende et al., 2014; Grathwohl et al., 2017) or control bias in biased estimators (Jang et al., 2016; Maddison et al., 2016).
Unfortunately, directly using RP Tree cannot achieve the second goal \\u2013 high efficiency, because during each partition, we need to project all data points into a random vector which is time consuming (see details in Section 2).
 Such a dataset may consist of features from different categories such as demographics (e.g, age, gender, income, etc.), examinations (e.g, blood pressure, lab results, etc.), and other clinical conditions.
 To go beyond the performance limitations of globally interpretable models, another promising direction is locally interpretable models, which instead of explaining the entire model explain a single prediction (Ribeiro et al., 2016).
 There are also some scenarios where train-test mismatch cannot be avoided because the training dataset only exists for a different domain.
 Fortunately, there are some multi-domain approaches which can perform well on multiple domains, e.g, Liao et al., (2017) can perform well on semantic and photo-realistic style transfer, Gu et al., (2018) is suitable for artistic and semantic style transfer, and Li et al., (2019) can adapt to artistic and photo-realistic style transfer.
 Most state-of-the-art detectors rely on anchors to enumerate the possible locations, scales, and aspect ratios for target objects (Liu et al., 2018).
 Due to the problems of gradient vanishing and exploding, extending the network to a deeper level for better representation is nearly difficult.
 As for defense, Goodfellow et al., (2014b) propose to robustify the network by adversarial training, which trains over the adversarial examples and still requires the network to output the correct label.
 Double-DIP from Gandelsman et al., (2019) further showed that it is possible to achieve robust unsupervised image decomposition from a single-image input, without pre-training on any data.
 Though effective, these conditional domain adversarial learning methods align different instances from different domains relying only on their own predictions.
 It is known that designing a reward function that ensures the agent to learn the desired behaviors is challenging (Hadfield-Menell et al., 2017).
 What is worse, when the recommendation systems are trained on static observations, the feedback is unavailable until it is deployed in real-world applications — in both training and validation phases, the target systems have no access to any feedback because no one has observed the recommended items.
 It has also been shown that increasing depth has an impact similar to adding momentum optimization and adaptive learning rate to the objective function 4.
Understanding this degradation in performance under adversarial attacks is of tremendous importance, especially for real-world DNN deployment, e.g, self-driving cars/drones and equipment for the visually impaired.
 Interestingly, the work of Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., (2017) demonstrated that such adversaries can be both network and input agnostic, i.g,universal deterministic samples that fool a wide range of DNNs across a large number of input samples.
 We focus on AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) trained on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) because many authors have studied the selectivity of single hidden units in this model using a range of quantitative (Zhou et al., 2018a; 2015) and qualitative (Nguyen et al., 2017; Yosinski et al., 2015; Simonyan et al., 2013) methods.
 TensorFlow, PyTorch, et al.,) that make it succinct and available to train more deeper networks.
 Despite the impressive empirical results and massive popularity of dynamic normalization methods, explaining their utility and proving that they converge when training with non-smooth, non-convex loss functions has remained an unsolved problem.
 Inductive approaches were proposed to address this issue.
 First, they are heuristic methods, and their relation to the standard convolution is not clearly identified.
 This is common in neural-network applications but could be relaxed.
Most channel pruning approaches can be categorized into two types: runtime approaches and static approaches.
 There are three training stages in our system.
To tackle these intrinsic drawbacks of gradient descent optimization methods, alternating minimization methods have started to attract attention as a potential way to solve deep learning problems.
 we combine embedded edge maps which act as a skeleton with a semantic map as input to our model (fig 2.1), The model outputs a photo-realistic version of that scene.
(Wessel & Wright, 2002)Generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) have emerged as a promising approach to the versatile (e.g, conditional generation from a low-dimensional latent vector (Mirza & Osindero, 2014)) and high-quality (e.g, super-resolution GAN (Ledig et al., 2017)) image.
 Some notable ones include sequential attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015), capsule networks (Sabour et al., 2017), and interpretable convolutional filters (Zhang et al., 2018).
Prompting this line of research is the increasing drive towards planetary-scale Earth observation to monitor the environment and human rights violations.
 Since this objective function is non-differentiable, prior approaches (Mirhoseini et al., 2017; 2018; Gao et al., 2018) have explored solutions based on reinforcement learning (RL).
 Later, graph kernels that model pairwise similarities between graphs utilized theoretical developments in graph isomorphism literature.
One obstacle in the way of understanding deep learning is the existence of magic modules in modern neural networks and magic tricks to train them.
 These methods are seldom applied in deep learning because they have traditionally failed to scale well with large datasets and many parameters (Rajaratnam & Sparks, 2015).
 Later, it was suggested by Zagoruyko & Komodakis (2016a); Huang & Wang (2017); Czarnecki et al., (2017) to transfer knowledge of representations, such as attention maps and gradients of the classifier, to help with the training of the student network.
 We review in Section 2 the family of one-class models as well as an unsupervised approximation of the risk, and explore their relation in Section 3.3, hence bridging the gap between both unsupervised discriminative classification approaches.
 The approximation is done by minimizing the KL divergence from the posterior to the variational distribution (Blei et al., 2017).
 One can theorise the frequency-related components in the learnt vector space, and remove them (Arora et al., 2017; Mu et al., 2018; Ethayarajh, 2018).
 Having image features suited for this task would help improve performance, and deep learning has revolutionized how image features are computed (Yi et al., 2016).
We have discovered that, making the distributions of the features in the same layer more similar would make the network performs better.
 But both methods require computing full gradients and Hessians of F (x) and thus suffer from high computational cost in large-scale problems.
 For instance, suppose that we predict infection and mortality for patients in intensive care units based on their medical records.
 After that, the learning rate decays similar to the optimization of other architectures.
 It points out that the link between reduction of ICS and performance improvement of BatchNorm is tenuous, at best.
 One theoretically sound metric is the conditional entropy of attributes given representations of data H(a|z) = Ep(z,a) − log p(a|z), where a and z denote the random variables of attributes and representations, as it is maximized if and only if the representations are invariant to attributes.
The scenario illustrated above poses a new challenge in the transfer learning for reinforcement learning (RL) domains.
 In addition, the energy landscape for parameter inference via optimization through a differentiable solver could be improved in order to match experimental data or observations, and generative networks for physical phenomena such as GANs, could employ a specialized metric to replace commonly used perceptual loss terms.
 To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there have not been many studies done to date that directly addressed the problem of training loss.
In this work we explore standard implementations of these loss functions and show there are two problems.
 These slots are then filled in by visual concepts identified by off-the-shelf object detectors (Lu et al., 2018).
 Yet, general means of enforcing these constraints do not exist and the existing methods do not scale well with high dimensional, high resolution outputs.
 Unfortunately, there has not yet been research on how to develop such a model, which thus remains a largely open challenge.
 In practice, that often results in dense connectivity and large memory consumption because they need to have sufficient edges to maintain specific graph properties, which is a major limitation of this class of approaches.
DNN is a mapping from a finite dimensional Euclidean space to another finite dimensional Euclidean space, that is to say it can be regarded as a vector-valued multivariate function.
 These problems can be solved sequentially or globally.
Our work belongs to the broad category of methods that solve the sparse reward problems with novelty models and reward shaping.
 Besides the high computational cost induced by the iteration process, such trial & test iterations must be repeated whenever dataset changes.
 More recent works such as MobileNetV2 (Sandler et al., 2018) and ShuffleNetV2 (Ma et al., 2018) further reduce the FLOPs.
Here, we introduce a novel way to approach this problem, which we term Multiple Instance Spatial Transformer, or MIST for brevity.
 This forces us to shift our attentions to certifiable defenses as they can classify all the samples in a predefined neighborhood of the natural samples with a theoretically-guaranteed error bound.
 Moreover, we show that many problem setups in adversarial attacks and defenses can in fact be reformulated under this general min-max framework, including attacking model ensembles (Tramèr et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018), devising universal perturbation to input samples (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2017) or data transformations (Athalye & Sutskever, 2018; Brown et al., 2017), and generalized AT over multiple types of threat models (Tramèr & Boneh, 2019; Araujo et al., 2019).
 A central dilemma in lifelong learning is how to achieve a balance between the performance on old tasks and the new task (Robins, 1995; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017).
 While in Rusu et al., (2016), a neural network that has lateral connections with old tasks is trained each time for the new task.
 Building on the idea of group convolutions proposed by Cohen & Welling (2016) for discrete symmetry groups, Cheng et al., (2019) and Weiler et al., (2018b) constructed SE(2)-equivariant CNNs by conducting group convolutions jointly across the space and SO(2) using steerable filters (Freeman & Adelson, 1991).
 On the other hand, pruning with budget constraints tailored for specific hardware platforms, as a promising direction for hardware-software co-optimization, is becoming increasingly important especially for edge device.
 Before the rise of deep learning, traditional statistical and machine learning approaches dominate this field (Li et al., 2012; Lippi et al., 2013; Moreira-Matias et al., 2013; Shekhar & Williams, 2007; Idé & Sugiyama, 2011; Zheng & Ni, 2013).
 Clearly, the RAM data contain much less redundant information irrelevant to the learning process than the raw images.
While these variational dropout approaches do yield compact networks, they are suboptimal in that the dropout rate for each neuron is learned completely independently of the given input data and labels.
 Unfortunately, its bottleneck is that computational complexity reaches O(nkd) (Rui Xu & Wunsch, 2005), since it requires computing the Euclidean distances between all samples and all centroids.
 This improvement opens up opportunities to scale up invertible models to complex tasks on larger datasets where invertibility and exact inference have advantages.
 Specifically, we use tools from information theory to bound the overall generalization gap of a meta-learner.
 Among these techniques, quantization is the most easy-to-use and scalable method, which uses fewer bits for data representations than the 32-bit precision.
 We denote the distribution of real data and the generatorinduced distribution byDreal andDg , respectively.
 However, justifying a prediction might be ambiguous and challenging.
 Most of key words or phrases of case1 and case2, which determine the category, are similar (e.g, NASA, moons, and Saturn), but the location of them is different.
 Therefore the problem of GANs is a min-max problem.
 While generative models are commonly used and have nice theoretical properties, their result could be sensitive to the underlying distributional assumptions of observed data and hard to adapt to different applications.
In this paper, we present a method to impose prior knowledge through homogeneous linear inequality constraints of the form Ax ≤ 0 on the activations of deep learning models.
Can the brain, with its many layers between input and output indeed solve this credit-assignment problem in a manner that is as powerful as deep learning? Similarly to deep neural networks, the brain of humans and animals are composed of many layers between the sensory neurons that register the stimuli and the motor neurons that control the muscles.
In this paper, we theoretically compare model-based RL and model-free RL in the continuous state space through the lens of approximability by neural networks, and then use the insight to design practical algorithms.
 Simply injecting extra random noise as input proved to be ineffective as shown in (Isola et al., (2017); Zhu et al., (2017b)), where the generator network just learns to ignore the extra noise and collapses to a single or few modes (which is one form of the mode collapse problem).
 Without explicit object detection, it is up to the attention mechanism to identify relevant image regions, in an unsupervised manner.
 In Supervised learning, the network maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.
 In general, we face two major challenges in generating effective audio adversarial examples: (C1) Human voices are often interleaved with silent periods due to the pauses in the speech.
 Instead, deep learning researchers today rely on a mixture of brute force search, augmented with simple heuristics such as using a staircase, polynomial, or exponential decay-based learning rate schedules.
 For example, an empirical neighbor sampling scheme is used to speed up GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017).
 In online experiment, Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm attracts a lot of attention due to its simplicity at implementation and resistance in batch updating.
 While these methods introduce no additional model parameters, the effectiveness largely depends on the degree of domain shifts.
Despite their success, these DA methods generally require domain-specific expert knowledge, manual operations and extensive amount of tuning depending on actual contexts Ciresan et al.,; Dosovitskiy et al., (2016).
 This task is characterized by the discrepency between the precision required of the predictions during inference and the noisiness of the training labels.
 Inspired by the success of CNNs, researchers generalize convolution operations to graphs to capture the local information.
Most existing works have focused on single-source to single-target (“one-to-one”) domain adaptation, using different assumptions such as covariate shift (Shimodaira, 2000; Gretton et al., 2009; Sugiyama & Kawanabe, 2012) or concept drift (Jiang & Zhai, 2007; Gama et al., 2014).
BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) employs a similar strategy by using a masked version of the language modeling objective.
In this paper, we focus on design and analysis of black-box (gradient-free) min-max optimization methods, where gradients are neither symbolically nor numerically available, or they are tedious to compute (Conn et al., 2009).
 In particular, to the best of our knowledge, there is no form of guarantee regarding the performance of previous tasks among the fixed capacity models which use standard SGD training schemes.
 For example, BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), a 24 layer transformer model, is shown to achieve the state of the art performance on several NLP tasks, including on the SQuAD dataset.
 Recent end-to-end TTS research has aimed to model and/or directly control the remaining variability in the output.
Scheduled Sampling (Bengio et al., 2015) aims to mitigate the discrepancy between train and test time in teacher-forcing by randomly replacing some tokens in the history with the model’s prediction.
 Word attribute transfer is expected to be applicable for natural language inference and data augmentation in natural language processing.
The first significant hint to the performance of Adam on BERT comes from the distribution of the stochastic gradients.
 A clear field where generative models can have a tremendous impact is in material discovery, which is very important for designing new batteries or carbon capture devices for fighting climate change.
 The most commonly used techniques include quantization (Gong et al., 2014), weights pruning (Han et al., 2015b), and knowledge distillation (KD) (Romero et al., 2014).
 For example, reinforcement learning with a controller neural network can learn very complex policies.
 The design optimization complexity further increases for recently proposed mixed-precision networks (Wang et al., (2019); Wu et al., (2018b); Dong et al., (2019)).
 Interestingly, many of the works in this area are associated with developing generative models.
Some models explicitly define p(x), the distribution of the data, and training is guided by maximizing the data likelihood.
In this paper, we take a step toward generating long-range, diverse and physically plausible motion sequences given starting and ending states, rather than learning a policy for a physical simulator.
 Second, the deep feature extraction network can obtain a larger receptive field to learn more context information (Luo et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018).
 Principally, their analysis shows that cross-lingual hubness, where a few words (hubs) in the source language are nearest cross-lingual neighbours of many words in the target language, and structural non-isometry between embeddings do impose a fundamental barrier to the performance of linear mapping methods.
 Data scalability denotes scalability to large datasets containing many data.
 However, when using third-party proprietary software or APIs, we may not have access to the internals or the possibility of finetuning the model to our domain.
 Instead of training every child model, they build a single model, called super-net, from neural architecture search space, and maintain a single copy of weights on the super-net.
 The experiments from the BigGAN paper require a full ‘TPU Pod’.
 Ulyanov et al., (2018) explained the reason why a high-capacity ConvNet can be used as a prior by the following statement: Network resists “bad” solutions and descends much more quickly towards naturally-looking images, and its phenomenon of “impedance of ConvNet” was confirmed by toy experiments.
 Advanced approaches in this direction have attempted to exploit graph neural network (Scarselli et al., 2009), capsule network (Sabour et al., 2017) or graph convolutional neural network (Kipf & Welling, 2017; Hamilton et al., 2017a) for supervised learning objectives (Li et al., 2016; Niepert et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018b; Ying et al., 2018; Verma & Zhang, 2018; Xu et al., 2019; Xinyi & Chen, 2019; Maron et al., 2019b; Chen et al., 2019).
 This is because that the weights learned in neural networks are highly correlated, and `1 regularization on such weights violates the incoherence or irrepresentable conditions needed for sparse model selection (Donoho & Huo, 2001; Tropp, 2004; Zhao & Yu, 2006), leading to spurious selections with poor generalization.
 To search a good architecture, various search strategies have been employed, such as random search, Bayesian optimization, reinforcement learning, and so on.
The central idea of SAUNA is to reject transitions that are not informative for the particular task at hand.
 Parsing in morphologically rich languages is challenging.
 For example, in Wesselink et al., (2018), the authors study organ injury, which may occur when a specific measurement (mean arterial pressure) decreases below a certain threshold.
 The training has to be done on each dataset, one after the other, without the possibility to reuse previous datasets.
 Therefore, the quality of imaging technology directly affects the analysis of fault detection results.
The decoders of these graph generation models generate a discrete graph-structured data from a (typically continuous) representation of a data sample, which is modeled by aforementioned statistical models.
 For instance, the use of a single-bit representation is being actively explored as an extreme quantization.
In this work, we perform a rigorous analysis of the norm, of both the activations and the gradients of each layer, in fully connected architectures at the point of initialization.
 Evaluating the required mutual information terms requires modeling probability distributions over activations rather than weights.
 Figure 1 shows two such AnyC2C examples.
 While the semantics of language is without doubt an important aspect of language, we believe that a single focus on semantic aspects leads to an impoverished model of language.
 As a solution, domain adaptation (DA) aims to transfer the knowledge learned from a source distribution, which is typically fully labeled into a different (but related) target distribution.
 In contrast, an explicit representation of żt offers several advantages:• Features that are constant within a time-series do not need to be encoded, as żt = 0.
 This traditional approach, which begins by assuming certain models to develop algorithms, comes with limitations in practice.
 For this class of machine learning tasks, we show how to approximately recover original inputs from adversarial inputs and thus defend the neural network `0-norm, `2-norm and `∞-norm attacks.
 Typically, the variational distribution is assumed standard Gaussian, but for example, Jiang et al., (2017) introduced a mixture of Gaussian variational distribution for clustering purposes.
 KD sets the teacher network’s class probabilities as a target which a small student network tries to mimic.
 The work (Ilyas et al., 2019) empirically shows the adversarial samples might be human imperceptible features that could help generalization, but it does not provide any general theoretic framework to properly explain this phenomenon.
 However, recent theoretical work (Zhao et al., 2019a) has demonstrated that tackling SLD is crucial to solving the domain adaptation problem.
 Here, the statistics which are used to model the probability distribution are not known in advance, but are modelled as neural networks trained together with the probability distribution model.
 As the mechanism designer, if we have a sample x drawn from the true distribution P, we can apply strictly proper scoring rules to elicit p: the agent who holds p will be scored using S(p, x).
We study the fundamental problem when differential privacy meets machine learning: the differentially private empirical risk minimization (DP-ERM) problem (Chaudhuri & Monteleoni, 2009; Chaudhuri et al., 2011; Kifer et al., 2012; Bassily et al., 2014; Talwar et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2017; Jayaraman et al., 2018; Feldman et al., 2018; Iyengar et al., 2019; Wang & Gu, 2019).
 Similarly, (Feng et al., 2018) describe a probabilistic 3D vehicle detector for Lidar point clouds that can model both classification and spatial uncertainty.
 It provides many different tasks ranging from simple paddle control in the ball game Pong to complex labyrinth exploration in Montezuma’s Revenge which remains unsolved by general algorithms up to today.
 As the relationships between treatment dosage efficacy, toxicity and patient features become more complex, estimating dose-response from observational data becomes particularly important in order to identify optimal dosages for each patient.
 Model evaluation is a complex process where the model, dataset, evaluation method, and HW/SW stack must work in unison to maintain the accuracy and performance claims (e.g, latency, throughput, memory usage).
 Few-shot learning limits the labeled data to very few on the end task, while the representation is learned on a large training set of different classes (Hariharan & Girshick, 2017; Snell et al., 2017; Vinyals et al., 2016).
To improve sample efficiency, in this paper, we explore how to design an efficient and stable algorithm with stochastic mirror descent (SMD).
 Several works have demonstrated that one may unveil interesting properties of the training dynamics by analyzing DNNs in the form of the IP (Yu & Principe, 2019; Goldfeld et al., 2019; Noshad et al., 2019; Chelombiev et al., 2019).
 Research on collaborative personalization in FL (Smith et al., 2017; Sebastian Caldas, 2019; Chen et al., 2018; Yao et al., 2019) has generally focused on the development of new techniques tailored to the FL setting.
 Domain adaptation techniques aim to update the data distribution in simulation to match the real distribution through some form of canonical mapping or using regularization methods (James et al., 2018; Bousmalis et al., 2017; Gamrian & Goldberg, 2018).
 Adversarial training can be posed as a robust optimization problem (Ben-Tal & Nemirovski, 1998), where a min-max optimization problem is solved (Madry et al., 2017; Kolter & Wong, 2017).
 Ledig et al., (2017); Wang et al., (2018b) proved that GAN-based methods can generate plausible-looking natural details which are consistent with the human visual system (HVS).
 Figure 1 shows examples of a natural image and corresponding adversarial images, each above their respective saliency maps.
 Location and orientation estimation tasks based on above networks with efficient transposed convolution structure can effectively solve the problem of invisible points in inference.
 For example, in the literature above, they obtain such performance with a well-tuned SGD with momentum and a learning rate decay schedule, or with a proper hyperparameter tuning in adaptive methods.
Nevertheless, we point out that the existing PC layer is still computationally expensive and occupies a lot of proportion in the number of weight parameters (Howard et al., 2017).
 With the cost of data storage also becoming increasingly important, the ability to automatically identify data to remove from the training distribution is appealing from a practical perspective.
 We argue that good representations should benefit multiple kinds of tasks, including both high-level recognition tasks and low-level pixel-wise prediction tasks.
 The performance of kNN significantly relies on the learning of distance metric that computes latent distance between different instances and classes.
 While many works investigate interpretability of discriminative models (Zeiler & Fergus, 2014; Simonyan et al., 2013; Mahendran & Vedaldi, 2015), only a few (Chen et al., 2016; Bau et al., 2019) address the understanding of generative ones.
 Notably, the entropic regularization of OT introduced by Cuturi (2013) preserves the geometrical structure endowed by the Wasserstein spaces and provides an efficient way to approximate optimal transport between measures.
 For example, Scharf & Demeure (1991) and Friedman et al., (2001) fit a smooth curve on observations in either time series (Ansley & Kohn (1984); Shumway & Stoffer (1982)) or spatial distribution (Friedman et al., (2001); Stein (2012)).
 Although appealingly simple and direct, such branch of RLfD unfortunately fails to fully exploit demonstration data as it can only provide supervision signal over those states observed in the demonstrations (Brys et al., 2015; Rajeswaran et al., 2017a; Reddy et al., 2019).
 Feature pyramid is a common practice.
 Then, the number of multiplications is reduced from v to q (expensive floating-point multipliers are less required for inference).
 Weight-sharing, introduced in ENAS (Pham et al., 2018), can alleviate this problem.
 Solutions have been proposed for this specific issue, such as temperature scaling, which divides the logits z by a constant T > 1 in order to obtain ”softer” probabilities.
In this paper, we note fundamental commonalities between these prior approaches and define a general framework, Recursive Input and State Estimation (RISE), that encompasses those approaches as specific instances.
 However, the linear-reward assumption often fails to hold exactly in practice, which motivates the study of nonlinear contextual bandits (e.g, Filippi et al., 2010; Srinivas et al., 2010; Bubeck et al., 2011; Valko et al., 2013).
 Tian et al., (2018) generated 254,221 images for testing a Chauffeur-CNN based autonomous driving model and achieved a neuron coverage (the ratio of activated neurons) of 88%.
 However cVAEs come with drawbacks of their own: The assumption of a Gaussian posterior on the decoder side implies an L2 reconstruction loss, which is known to cause blurriness.
 In the case of a wide network, we find that the resulting visualizations differ dramatically.
A qualified point cloud data generation network should satisfy the following conditions: 1) It should be able to synthesize 3D objects that are both highly varied and vivid, which means that there need to be fine details in the generated examples Wu et al., (2016). 2) The distribution of the data generated should be similar to that of the original data.
 Supervised approaches require in-domain parallel data, i.g,both input articles and corresponding reference summaries must be present for training (Hermann et al., 2015; Liu & Lapata, 2019).
 These works have identified weight regularization (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989; Zenke et al., 2017; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Li & Hoiem, 2016; Nguyen et al., 2018) and rehearsal techniques (Ratcliff, 1990; Lopez-Paz & Ranzato, 2017; Rebuffi et al., 2017; Bachem et al., 2015) or have postulated methods based on complementary learning systems theory (O’Reilly & Norman, 2003) through dual-model with generative memory approaches (Gepperth & Karaoguz, 2016; Shin et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2018; Farquhar & Gal, 2018; Achille et al., 2018) as mechanisms against catastrophic inference.
 However, Locatello et al., (2018) pointed out that the total correlation of sampled distribution TCsample being low does not necessarily give rise to a low total correlation of the corresponding mean representation TCmean.
 Based on the latent variable assumption (Doersch, 2016), the generative model has an explicit variational inference form, so it can learn the marginal probability distribution of the raw data as well as the conditional distribution of the latent variables given the input data, which makes predictions more reasonable.
 We demonstrate that both the maximum softmax and the model entropy are uncertainly measures.
 That is, as the learner experiences new tasks, it quickly forgets previously acquired knowledge.
Based on these definitions, disentangled representation can be learned in a supervised fashion where explicit and/or implicit prior knowledge on the generative factors of data are available.
 However, training under a distribution of randomised visual attributes of the simulator, such as textures and lighting (Sadeghi & Levine, 2016; Viereck et al., 2017), as well as physics (OpenAI et al., 2018), can be substantially more difficult and slower due to the increased variability of the learning domain (OpenAI et al., 2018; Tobin et al., 2017).
 That is, the length of the output signal wave is 10000 times longer in this case.
All of these problems can be modeled as constrained convex optimization problems with a large number of constraints.
 We give precise generalization bounds for deep regression with dropout; our bounds leverage recent results in understanding generalization in deep learning and help explain practice with meaningful bounds.
 Fan et al., (2018) proposes a more general teacher-student framework that first trains a teacher network to select data that directly optimizes development set accuracy over multiple training runs.
 In this work, we propose an original neural architecture that repeatedly reads from a set of paragraphs to aggregate and reformulate information.
 Our work is at the intersection between few-shot learning and semisupervised learning where we augment the capability of few-shot artificial learners with a learning signal derived from unlabeled data.
 To our best knowledge, there are only three available multilingual pre-trained models to date: (1) the multilingualBERT (mBERT)1 that supports 104 languages, (2) cross-lingual language model (XLM; Lample & Conneau, 2019)2 that supports 100 languages, and (3) Language Agnostic SEntence Representations (LASER; Artetxe & Schwenk, 2019)3 that supports 93 languages.
Here, we take a different learning-based approach to instruction-following that is robust to human commands.
 Unlike PCA, much of the focus of the more recent non-linear methods including t-SNE (Maaten & Hinton, 2008), LargeVis (Tang et al., 2016), and UMAP (McInnes et al., 2018) has been on preserving the local neighborhood structure of each individual point.
 It has been proposed that good generalization correlates with flat minima of the non-convex loss surface (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; 1995) and this correlation has been empirically validated (Keskar et al., 2016; Novak et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018).
 However, gradient clipping has an increasing relative effect as the number of model parameters grows.
 The standard information aggregation game, outlined in Section 2.1, involves agents (repeatedly) guessing an unknown state of the world taking into account an informative private signal and observations of actions of their neighbors on the social network in the previous period.
In supervised learning, a key reason why pre-training is incredibly successful is that the dataset used for pre-training can be collected from naturally occurring large-scale processes.
The question investigated in this paper is whether this difference has consequences for how the two models compute spatiotemporal features.
In particular, when an input is invalid, or does not belong to any of the target classes, the system should identify the input as out-of-distribution.
 The error rate and the distribution of the noise is dependent on the technology used to sequence the DNA fragments (Quail et al., 2012).
 On the other hand, in the belief or evidence theory, Subjective Logic (SL) (Josang et al., 2018) considered vacuity (or lack of evidence) as uncertainty in an subjective opinion.
 However, undesirable prediction errors still occur, e.g, predicting a wrong comparative or superlative structure (such as < instead of ≤).
 In part of domain adaptation literature (Eg.
 Compk(g p t ) ∈ Rd zeros out (d− k) elements of gpt and keeps k elements unchanged.
Another limitation of many existing MBRL methods is that they rely on the model predictive control (MPC) framework (Garcia et al., 1989).
 Many expressions have a defined leading polynomial power in these limits.
 In the black-box setting, the attacker can provide any inputs and receive the corresponding predictions.
 Therefore the selection of this divergence is one of the crucial factors of making VI successful.
 Guo et al., (2017) observed that modern neural networks are miscalibrated by experimentally showing that the average confidence of deep neural networks is usually much higher than their accuracy.
 Neural networks operate in a regime where the number of parameters is much larger than the number of training data.
 Typical noise injection methods are additive Gaussian noise, dropout noise or adversarial noise.
We present ALI-G (Adaptive Learning-rates for Interpolation with Gradients), an algorithm that takes advantage of interpolation by design and satisfies both properties mentioned above.
Some reasons for this are the diversity of data sources (satellite types, data acquisition modes, resolutions), the need of domain knowledge and special data processing, and the wide and scattered field of applications.
Our contributions are as follows:
 For example, (Athalye et al., 2018) showed most of the empirical defenses proposed in ICLR 2018 can be broken by developing tailored attacks for each of them.
 There are subtle trade-offs in performance when increasing or reducing use of parameters and operations.
 Yet, canonical neural network architectures for tabular data understanding have been under-explored.
 However, these useful feature calibration elements have never been well exploited in NAS, significantly limiting the potentials of NAS which aims for automatically discovering more sophisticated and advanced network architectures without human engineering.
 For example, enforcing that examples close in feature space are labeled similarly.
 It is unclear what about the LSTM’s structure lends itself towards good linguistic representations, and under what conditions these representations might fall short of grasping the structure and meaning of language.
 In addition, when the nodes are not labeled/attributed, the spatial graph convolution only propagates information about the degree of the nodes which might not lead to extracting informative features about the topological structure of the graph.
 Although observing (adversarial) perturbations of clean data in training improves robustness against that particular manipulation (the green line), the DNN is still fragile when unseen manipulations are present (orange line).
 In two recent papers (Nguyen, 2019; Sirignano & Spiliopoulos, 2019), this approach has been extended to multi-layer fully-connected networks by taking the widths to infinity successively from higher to lower layers.
 Zero-order optimization via Gaussian smoothing was introduced in Nesterov & Spokoiny (2017) and extended to black-box sampling with Langevin dynamics in Shen et al., (2019).
Developing deep learning methods that can incorporate physical laws in a systematic manner is a key element in advancing AI for physical sciences (Steven Brunton, 2019).
 This property allows to compute a provable upper-bound on the optimal value function of a target task, given the learned optimal value function of a source task.
Exhaustively computing the exact inner product between q and N datapoints is often very expensive and sometimes infeasible.
 The noise level p may vary in the range of 0%-100%, where p = 0% is the clean dataset whereas p = 100% represents the dataset of zero correct labels.
 In these studies, knowledge graphs are defined as directed graphs having nodes as entities and labeled edges as relations; edges are directed from the head entity to the tail entity.
Assessing the empirical effectiveness of an adversarial defence requires careful testing with multiple attacks (Goodfellow et al., 2018).
 Therefore, it is more appropriate to complement the representation of input data from the perspective of information that has not been learned for enhancing the robustness of machine learning algorithms.
 Furthermore, metadata are commonly used as evaluation data for graph embeddings (8).
 While effective in some settings, these approaches do not consider settings where the questions are asked about partially unobservable states.
 However, in real-world applications, sentences typically reside in a proper context such as a paragraph.
 Thus, it might fail in scenarios where coordination is unlikely to occur by chance.
 Only on simple datasets such as MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998), adversarial training is able to preserve accuracy.
Motivated by the limitation of heuristic defense, another line of research (known as verified/certified robustness) aims to provide provable robust guarantees of DNNs against an input with arbitrary perturbation within a certain `p ball region (Katz et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2017; Carlini et al., 2017; Kolter & Wong, 2018; Raghunathan et al., 2018; Weng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Boopathy et al., 2019; Dvijotham et al., 2018b; Wong et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2019; Gowal et al., 2018; Mirman et al., 2018; Dvijotham et al., 2018a).
 This property is known as homophily.
 To deal with the challenges, Kim & Rush (2016) consider applying Knowledge Distillation approaches (Hinton et al., 2015) to match the distribution of the teacher model.
While we might expect neural networks to respond differently to OOD examples than to in-distribution (ID) examples, exactly where and how to find these differences in activity patterns is not at all clear.
 In many applications, it is crucial to guide the graph generation process by conditioning on an input graph, which can be cast as a graph translation learning problem – translating the input graph to the output graph.
In this paper, we introduce TPO, a Tree Search Policy Optimization for environments with continuous action spaces.
 This is because the state-of-the-art object detection methods (He et al., 2015; Girshick, 2015; Ren et al., 2015; Dai et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017; He et al., 2017) adopt the region-based paradigm since it was introduced in the seminal R-CNN work (Girshick et al., 2014).
 Most recently, Parallel WaveNet (van den Oord et al., 2018) and ClariNet (Ping et al., 2018a) were proposed for parallel waveform synthesis by distilling an inverse autoregressive flow (IAF) (Kingma et al., 2016) from a pretrained WaveNet.
 There are two main drawbacks to this approach: (1) Pipeline systems are prone to error propagation between the NER and RE systems.
Our Contributions.
Having a prediction might not be enough for many real-world machine learning applications.
 This kind of progressive growing also helps push the state of the arts to a new level by enabling StyleGAN to produce photo-realistic and detail-sharp results (Karras et al., 2018b), shedding new light on wide applications of GANs in solving real problems.
 In particular, we train the decoder jointly with the network, terming the resultant objective function perceptual regularization.
 The second direction is promising in that the interpretability is built-in architecturally.
 On the other hand, the number of the current works targeting the optimization of the inference are: reduced precision computation (Rastegari et al., 2016; Courbariaux et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016), look-up and precomputing (Abdiyeva et al., 2018; Brendel & Bethge, 2019), pruning (Anwar et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016; Zhu & Gupta, 2017; Raghu et al., 2017; Morcos et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2019) and knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015).
 Such a phenomenon is closely related to linearity and over-fitting of models (Szegedy et al., 2014; Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2017; Goodfellow et al., 2015; Tramèr et al., 2018).
 Moreover, it is shown that the eigenvector of the normalized Laplacian matrix can be used to find the approximate solution to the well known normalized cuts problem (Ng et al., 2002; Von Luxburg, 2007).
 However, there are still many document-level tasks, e.g, document-level text summarization (Hermann et al., 2015), long-document machine reading comprehension (Hewlett et al., 2016) and long text classification (Zhang et al., 2015).
 The quality of C-JPG will greatly drop, and the compression may yield unpleasant artifacts, for example, the presence of obvious partition lines, which vastly deteriorates the overall visual feeling.
 Inference in Boltzman machines (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009) is tractable only under approximations (Welling & Teh, 2003).
 In order to better generalize to newer or broader chemical spaces, recently developed template-free approaches cast the problem as a sequence-to-sequence prediction task.
 Each subroutine represents a simple function, and can be composed with others to express the algorithm.
 Both examples of uncertainty require simultaneous inference and decision making, which can be framed as Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) over latent Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
 In this case, GANs must attempt to learn a continuous cover of the multiple manifolds, which inevitably leads to the generation of off-manifold points which lie in between (Kelley, 2017).
To overcome those limitations, recent years have seen a number of ML based algorithms being proposed for the TSP (briefly reviewed in the next section), which attempt to automate the search process by learning mechanisms.
 Even models based on off-policy algorithms like Q-learning fail to learn in the offline, batch setting, when the model is not able to explore.
 Deterministic embeddings fail to capture uncertainty due either to out-ofdistribution inputs (e.g, data corruption) or label ambiguity (e.g, overlapping classes).
 With welldefined reward functions, such as the ones in Atari games (Mnih et al., 2015), the agents are shown to achieve extremely promising performance.
 This mechanism allows LMs to take in relatively large, yet still fixed, sized input.
 On-device model customization has been achieved by techniques such as weight-imprinting (Qi et al., 2018), or by retraining limited sets of layers.
 Humans also find it difficult to accurately label pixels near object boundaries.
 Learning useful embeddings in a supervised setting with limited data is often difficult.
 However, how to best combine local approximations remains an open problem.
 A crucial feature of the logical reasoning domain (as is visible in the SAT problem) is that the inputs are often structural, where logical connections between entities (variables in SAT problems) are the key information.
 It is hard to construct a solution that is a perfect compromise between all cases.
 Latent variable models such as variational autoencoders (Kingma & Welling, 2013) tend to better capture the global feature representation in data, but do not offer an exact density estimate.
 As a result, MBRL has become one of the possible solutions to reduce the number of samples required to learn an optimal policy.
 In a variety of sequence learning tasks, they have demonstrated comparable or even better performance than that of RNNs (Gehring et al., 2017; Bai et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018).
 More relevantly, sport has risen to an increasingly key space within the machine learning community as an application to expand our understanding of adversarial multiagent motion, interaction, and representation (Lucey et al., 2013; Le et al., 2017; Felsen et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2016; Zhan et al., 2018; Yeh et al., 2019; Kurach et al., 2019).
 Gale et al., (2019) show it is possible to prune 90% of all weights in a ResNet-50 network (He et al., 2015) trained on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) and only lose less than 3% absolute in top-1 test set accuracy.
 How to learn those task structures or temporal abstractions automatically is still an active studying area.
 LPs require specification of a pivoting rule, and decades of research has generated many different options.
 Buesing et al., (2018) developed state-space models techniques to reduce computational complexity by making predictions at a higher level of abstraction, rather than at the level of raw pixel observations.
 However, such probabilistic models must be properly normalized, which requires evaluating intractable integrals over the space of all possible variable configurations (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009).
 However, this discriminator does not yield an informative reward function because it ignores behavior.
 When the setting changes even very slightly, the original method cannot work properly.
 However, due to the large number of possible attribute-object pairs, supervised learning methods, asking for massive data annotations for each attribute-object pair, will confront the composition explosion disaster.
 Amid such contrasting views arises a need to understand the attention mechanism more systematically.
 (1)Many adversarial learning methods can be interpreted as empirical minimization of (1) (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Kurakin et al., 2016b; Ruitong Huang & Szepesvari, 2015; Madry et al., 2017).
 The classical example is Random Forest, which outputs the majority answer from multiple trained decision trees.
 Therefore, the gradient of the mapping/function is not available.
 Another representative visual explanation, class activation map (CAM) Zhou et al., (2016), generates the heatmap of discriminative regions corresponding to a specific class based on the linearity of global average pooling (GAP) and fully connected (FC) layer.
One of the prevailing methods is to deem the retrosynthesis prediction as a machine translation task.
 In this paper, we aim to address the twin objectives of learning how measurements relate in the form of a topic model, and learning how topics can assist in predicting time-to-event outcomes via a survival analysis model.
 Tight localization is important because many objects (such as persons) are highly deformable.
Existing methods for uncertainty quantification are based predominantly on Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), whereby predictive uncertainty is evaluated via posterior credible intervals (Welling & Teh (2011); Hernández-Lobato & Adams (2015); Ritter et al., (2018); Maddox et al., (2019)).
Graph-structured models are another class of models that heavily rely on local observations and sequential inference.
 As another example, in reading comprehension tasks like NarrativeQA Kočiskỳ et al., (2018), truth answers are human-generated ones and might not have exact matches in the original passage.
 To achieve a FPR of , BF costs at least n log2(1/ ) log2 e bits (n = |S|), which is log2 e ≈ 44% off from the theoretical lower bound (Carter et al., 1978).
 DPSGD, however, falls short on the utility front, the main reason for which we discuss below.
 For instance, experimental results indicate a performance decrease for deeper GNNs due to the signal smoothing effect of each GC layer (Li et al., 2018a).
 Thus, the generator obtains very small gradients from discriminator and is hard to converge.
 Given a sample x ∈ X , most attacks for constructing adversarial examples find a perturbation δ with a small norm (typical norms that are used are l∞, l0, and l2) such that x+δ has a different label than x, i.g,F (x) 6= F (x+δ).
 This simplicity comes at a cost; most rewards are identical, so that there is little gradient information to guide policy learning.
 In state-of-the-art models trained on billion-scale corpora, this number ranges between 10 and 30 (Melis et al., 2017; Radford et al., 2019).
 For example, Liu et al., (2017c) proposes the Quality Aware Network (QAN) to learn quality score for each image inside an image set during network training.
 For example, the Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation (RISE) method (Petsiuk et al., 2018) perturbed an image with a randomised mask to measure the importance of pixels and then linearly fused all importance from several thousand masks.
 An episode of the whole game consists of multiple independent rounds, where each round lasts constant timesteps.
 Moreover, g(·) denotes a ReLU-like activation function.
There has been extensive previous work, some of which we review in Section 2, on modeling temporal data using various forms of state space models (SSM).
 Working with unknown noise rates is difficult in practice: Often, one must estimate the noise rates from data, which may require additional data collection (Natarajan et al., 2013; Scott, 2015; Van Rooyen et al., 2015) (e.g, be a redundant set of noisy labels for each sample point, or a set of ground truth labels for tuning these parameters) and may introduce estimation error that can affect the final model in less predictable ways.
 We do this by equipping them with metrics defined on the manifold of probabilistic measures, namely a class of Wasserstein distances (WDs, Villani (2008)).
 Recent research has typically focused on either finding fixed-length and low-dimensional representations (Zhang et al., 2019; Rusanov et al., 2016) or on modifying the similarity measure (Giannoula et al., 2018; Luong and Chandola, 2017) both in an attempt to apply the conventional clustering algorithms (e.g, K-means (Lloyd, 1982)) to time-series observations.
 However, running these models on edge-devices, face memory and latency issues due to limitations of the hardware.
 While batching alleviates the pressure on DRAM bandwidth, it can decrease model accuracy (Masters & Luschi, 2018) especially when scaling training on large clusters (Akiba et al., 2017).
 This prevents applications of GCN on many real-world networks, where the graphs usually contain millions or even billions of nodes.
 Many variants of Adagrad, such as RMSprop (Hinton et al., 2012), Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015), Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012), Nadam (Dozat, 2016), were then proposed to address these challenges by adopting exponential moving average rather than the arithmetic average used in Adagrad.
 If W l adopts Kaiming’s initialization, a small τ is necessary for a stable forward process of ResNet, because the output explodes in expectation for τ = 1 when L gets large.
 Prior to the availability of large annotated video datasets most video-based feature learning models were trained using unsupervised learning objectives, many of them inspired by Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) (Wiskott & Sejnowski, 2002).
 A supernet subsuming all architectures is trained only once.
 To obtain the relevance scores for local explanation, gradient-based methods compute the partial derivative of the class probability with respect to an input instance.
 First, overlapping patches are extracted from input image.
 Goodfellow et al., (2015) argue that the adversarial examples are caused by the linear nature of deep networks.
A machine learning problem is formulated as follows.
 Traditional simulation environments are large and specialized codebases written in C++ or FORTRAN, along with custom CUDA kernels for GPU acceleration.
 Furthermore, to use the change of variable formula, the latent space of a reversible model must have the same dimensionality as the data space, which is unreasonable considering that real-world, high-dimensional data (e.g, images) tends to lie on low-dimensional manifolds, and thus results in redundant latent dimensions and variability.
Although existing quantization based approaches, which mainly use one fixed bit to represent the whole DNN model, yields encouraging compression ratio while keeping the model’s performance, we argue that simply using only a fixed bit for quantization is not the optimal choice for the trade-off between a model size and its performance.
 It has been recognized that these methods suffer from significant performance degradation under strong attacks, especially white-box attacks with large magnitude and iterations (Samangouei et al., 2018).
 In this work, we theoretically study the GCN model (Kipf and Welling, 2017) and the SGC model (Wu et al., 2019).
In this paper, we propose a new sequence model that recursively parameterizes the recurrent unit.
 These sequential outputs can be interpreted as real-valued, discrete-time signals.
 Although there is no clear consensus on which quantitative metric is most appropriate to benchmark GAN-based models, Inception Score (IS) (Salimans et al., 2016) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) (Heusel et al., 2017) have been extensively used.
 Unstructured pruning methods (Han et al., 2015b;a) delete network connec-tions which are thought unimportant.
Previous PBL architectures have achieved competitive performance on a wide variety of tasks in microscopy (Rivenson et al., 2019; Nehme et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2018; Sinha et al., 2017; Goy et al., 2018), low level and high level computer vision (Ba et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019), medical imaging (Jin et al., 2017; Kang et al., 2017), and robot control (Zeng et al., 2019; Ajay et al., 2019).
 In practice, this enables our spectrogram models to generate unconditional speech and music samples with consistency over multiple seconds whereas time-domain models must be conditioned on intermediate features to capture structure at similar timescales.
In this paper, we investigate an alternative paradigm that substantially increases the richness of the reward functions, while not severely burdening the human-in-the-loop.
 While people have proposed various methods for active learning on graphs (Bilgic et al., 2010; Kuwadekar & Neville, 2011; Moore et al., 2011; Rattigan et al., 2007), active learning for GNN has received relatively few attention in this area.
 These notions of fairness can be appropriate in many scenarios, but in domains where quality of service is paramount, such as healthcare, we argue that it is necessary to strive for models that are as close to fair as possible without introducing any unnecessary harm to any subgroup (Ustun et al., (2019)).
 Ideally, fresh (unlabeled) data from the training distribution would fuel this task, but often no fresh data remains after the teacher is trained (Bucila et al., 2006; Ba & Caruana, 2014).
 For example, the discriminative model corresponding to a unimodal Gaussian distribution is logistic regression (see Appendix A for derivation).
 Unsmoothness is a common phenomenon in many spatial and/or temporal data sets.
 For example, in the financial market, the underlying causal drivers of stock prices are often heterogeneous across stocks of different plates.
 Typically a known class label or metric embedding is given when training these conditional models.
 The factors can either be explicitly provided or learned in an unsupervised manner.
 Unfortunately, in practice data is often not distributed in such a convenient manner (13).
 This is due to the lack of a widely accepted metric to quantitatively compare them.
 Therefore, state-of-the-art VQA models have been continually proposed, but their internal processes are yet opaque.
 Most of the successful methods are based on adversarial training (Szegedy et al., 2013; Madry et al., 2017; Goodfellow et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2015).
 This kind of fast and flexible learning is challenging, since the agent must effectively integrate its prior experience with a small amount of new information, while avoiding overfitting to the new data.
 Importantly, we aim to train a single policy that can generate behaviors calibrated across multiple styles.
 The first issue is how to define a loss function over pairs of examples.
 Having a model designed to learn and extract information from partially-observed data will not only largely increase the application spectrum of deep learning based models, but also provide benefit to new down-stream tasks, for example, data imputation.
 In particular, quantization to very low precision is especially efficient on custom hardware where arbitrary precision arithmetic operations require proportional resources.
 In ConvLSTM networks, each cell is a first-order recurrent model, where the hidden state is updated based on its immediate previous step.
Recent work has demonstrated that structurally sparse training can speed up execution on GPUs (He et al., 2017; Lym et al., 2019; Zhu & Gupta, 2017).
 Conversely, tasks such as super-resolution and semantic segmentation require the generation of details from coarser representations; this is achieved by the use of transposed (or fractionally strided) convolutions (Long et al., 2015).
 Then labeled source data is used to learn a model for the target domain.
 There has been conjecture that such models are connected asymptotically, with respect to the width of hidden layers.
 Since invariant data are high-dimensional in general, learning theory claims that the high-dimensionality reduces its generalization performance.
 By contrast with feature extraction methods, such as PCA (Jolliffe, 2011), feature selection also reduces the burden of measuring all features.
 (3) Previous studies, including (Caron, 2001; Turney, 2012; Bullinaria & Levy, 2012; Levy et al., 2015; Artetxe et al., 2018), empirically observe that α in word embedding E = Ud ·Σαd 1 has an important influence on the quality of word embedding.
 We then empirically analyze the instability and generalization associated with various magnitude-pruning (Han et al., 2015b) algorithms in different settings, making the following contributions:
To improve the variational lower-bound, one alternative way to using powerful posterior distributions is to learn the prior, an idea initially suggested by Hoffman & Johnson (2016).
From a mathematical perspective, invertible architectures enable several unique guarantees like:• Enabling flexible approximation of non-linear diffeomorphisms (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015; Dinh et al., 2017; Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018; Chen et al., 2019) • Memory-saving gradient computation (Gomez et al., 2017; Donahue & Simonyan, 2019) • Fast analytical invertibility (Dinh et al., 2014) • Guaranteed preservation of mutual information and exact access to invariants of deepnetworks (Jacobsen et al., 2018; 2019).
However, the existing randomized smoothing methods can only work against `2 attack, in which the perturbations are allowed within an `2 ball of certain radius.
Having fixed a definition of fairness, most works in algorithmic fairness proceed by imposing constraints during the training process in an attempt to enforce fairness (Hardt et al., 2016; Joseph et al., 2016; Zafar et al., 2017a;b).
 To leverage the world graph, we model hierarchical RL (HRL) agents where a high-level policy chooses a waypoint state as a goal to guide exploration towards task-relevant regions, and a low-level policy strives to reach the chosen goals.
 In contrast, standard training of neural networks employs a point estimate of the parameters, which cannot account for model uncertainty.
To improve the neighborhood aggregation scheme, some studies have incorporated node information; They fully utilize node information and reduce the effects of relational (edge) information.
Another class of approaches treat the deep learner as a black-box.
 For more details of current status, please refer to a recent survey (Akhtar & Mian, 2018).
 The weights are a representation of past data (the training set of inputs and outputs), trained for predicting statistics of the training set itself (e.g, the output), relative to prior knowledge.
 This can result in unbounded approximation error, divergence, policy cycling, and other undesirable behavior.
In recent years, many unsupervised representation learning methods (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Le & Mikolov, 2014; Misra et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2017; Gidaris et al., 2018) have been introduced, of which most are self-supervised approaches that formulate the problem as an annotation free pretext task.
 In 2015, the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis (Singer et al., 2016; Seymour et al., 2016; Shankar-Hari et al., 2016) committee worked towards incorporating medical and technological advances into an up-to-date definition of sepsis, providing scientists with widely acknowledged illness criteria.
 This type of attacks can be used as a “universal” way to evaluate robustness of any given models, no matter continuous or discrete.
 Intuitively, as the training data becomes less noisy, better performance can be obtained.
The problem of how to improve model prediction by leveraging semantic coherence among neighboring scene images has previously been considered in the literature.
 For example, there may be severe consequences if an RL-agent-driven autonomous vehicle is compromised by adversarial examples fed from a malicious attacker.
 Consequently, it is highly unstable and prone to miss modes Salimans et al., (2016); Che et al., (2016).
 This has previously been shown by Goyal et al., (2019) in partially-observable, goal-driven (i.g, with extrinsic rewards) 2D navigation settings, where using decision states to guide exploration enables faster learning.
 Lee et al., (2018a) propose to explicitly train a classifier using the OOD samples generated by a GAN (Goodfellow et al., (2014a)).
 Recent work in adversarial imitation learning (Ho & Ermon, 2016; Finn et al., 2016) has accomplished this by using a discriminator to judge whether a given behavior is from an expert or imitator, and then a policy is trained using the discriminator expert likelihood as a reward.
 These stored multi-step returns, however, will differ from the true value of the target-policy.
 The robot may switch from one environment to another during the course of deployment, and these task switches may not be directly observed.
 In this work, we focus on the efficient exploration aspect.
 Others have triedto understand robustness by highlighting systemic failure modes of current methods.
 SAC has a similar structure to TD3, but also employs maximum entropy reinforcement learning.
In this paper, we expand on this line of work and empirically answer other important open questions on winning tickets and the data-labels distribution on which they are generated.
 However, the sparsity of data points in high-dimensional space often leads to model overfitting, thus necessitating research on opposite mapping from y to x, i.g,g : Rdy → Rdx , y 7→ x = g(y),where g(·) is the opposite mapping function with respect to f(·), to reconstruct the data.
 This is a critical advantage, as training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on long sequences remains challenging due to unstable gradients and the computational requirements of backpropagation through time (BPTT) (Hochreiter, 1991; Bengio et al., 1994).
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Schmidhuber, 1990; Goodfellow et al., 2014) are a class of DNN that consist of two sub-networks: a generative model and a discriminative model.
 Inspired by BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), which has successfully applied Transformer to NLP tasks through large-scale language modeling, we pre-train UNITER through three pre-training tasks: (i) Masked Language Modeling (MLM) conditioned on image; (ii) Masked Region Modeling (MRM) conditioned on text; and (iii) joint Image-Text Matching (ITM).
 Such a formulation encapsulates plentiful important problems, including sparse graphical model learning (Zhou et al., 2019), sparse linear/logistic regression (Blumensath & Davies, 2009; Foucart, 2011; Pati et al., 1993; Bahmani et al., 2013), and low-rank regression (Rohde et al., 2011).
 Towards this end, we investigate the emergent visual representations that occur in RL policies.
 However, setting up Runge-Kutta involves several design choices, one of which is the step size controller.
 The users’ training data does not leave their devices.
 In addition, Arora et al., (2019) provided a generalization bound via a fine-grained analysis of the gradient descent.
 But the GAN formulation is not a convex-concave problem.
 We say that an action by an agent is dominated by another if the first action offers the agent a strictly lower reward than taking the second action, no matter which actions are taken by the other agents.
 Both input and output structures are modelled as Tensor Product Representations (TPRs) (Smolensky, 1990).
Statistically, this discrepancy means the two distributional functions of real texts and generated texts is different.
 For example, given no instance of chew in the training data, the model is expected to recognize it during testing.
Intriguingly, certain biological neurons extract representations that efficiently capture the predictive information in sequential stimuli (Palmer et al., 2015; Tkačik & Bialek, 2016).
 All of these techniques only sample one single chemical compound in geometry space.
 A molecule’s graph representation and a set of its conformations are shown in fig. 1
 This has given rise to the important literature of Domain Adaptation (Pan & Yang, 2010; Kouw & Loog, 2019).
 By sampling small training and test sets from a large collection of labeled examples of base classes, meta-learning based few-shot classification approaches learn to extract task-agnostic knowledge, and apply it to a new few-shot learning task of novel classes.
 During inference, it evaluates all the class conditional likelihoods of the test input, and outputs the class label corresponding to the maximum.
 As the most straight-forward way, supervised learning schemes can be used for training DNNs to imitate the solutions obtained from existing solvers (Vinyals et al., 2015; Li et al., 2018; Selsam et al., 2019).
 However, it might be the case that the available labeled examples are of different granularity level.
 The transformations required by the former not only add data preprocessing overhead, but also introduce spatial displacements that distort relevant correlations among points (Zhang et al., 2019a).
To summarise our contributions:
 In other words, to develop principled unsupervised RL algorithms that result in useful policies, maximizingH(S) is not enough.
 In this manuscript we restrict our attention to the VAE model, since by its architecture, it is the only one where the learnt representation, possibly from different datasets, can be used as input for networks performing different tasks, (Achille et al., 2018; Ramapuram et al., 2017).
Recent work has shown that evolutionary agents for architecture search can match or outperform deep RL methods (Real et al., 2018; So et al., 2019).
 Recently, automated frameworks, such as the so-called neural architecture search (NAS) (Zoph & Le, 2017), have been proposed.
 However, none of these models have taken the correlations between the manifolds into account.
 Specifically, Omniglot classes always correspond to alphabet characters, while miniImageNet classes always correspond to object categories as defined by the WordNet taxonomy (Miller, 1995; Russakovsky et al., 2015).
 CVAEs model diverse futures by factorizing the distribution of future states using a set of latent variables which are mapped to likely future states.
 Therefore we focus our work on individualized feature importance in time series settings.
 For example, the existence of adversarial examples (Biggio et al., 2013; Szegedy et al., 2014)—and the fact that they may correspond to flipping predictive features Ilyas et al., (2019)—suggests that deep neural networks make predictions based on features that are vastly different from what humans use, or even recognize.
 Weight sharing mechanism has shown to be a promising avenue for efficient NAS.
 Specifically, in environments with misleading rewards which may trap the agent in local optima, simply imitating ‘good’ trajectories that would accumulate misleading positive rewards may guide the agent to a myopic behavior and hinder it from reaching a higher return in the longer term.
 Moreover, these real-world network datasets have complex relationships going beyond pairwise associations.
 Accordingly, a myriad of techniques have been proposed to attempt to achieve tolerance to different types of transformations (see Cohen & Welling (2016) for a review).
Human intelligence is remarkable for their fast adaptation to many new situations using the knowledge learned from past experience.
 However, it is often not tractable to accurately model all the available information.
 GEM outperforms two state-of-the-art methods, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017) and iCARL (Rebuffi et al., 2017) on variants of the MNIST and CIFAR100 datasets.
 One hope for improving the accuracy further is to somehow capture modern innovations such as batch normalization, data augmentation, residual layers, etc. in CNTK.
 Meanwhile, there are additional objectives: picking up bullets and medicines, which may help kill more enemies in general, but their relationship with killing is still complex and ambiguous at every specific moment.
 Together, these changes create a new, artificial noise floor at each step of gradient descent, such that the unique signal of any individual example is below this new noise floor; this allows differential privacy to be guaranteed for all training examples (Dwork & Roth, 2014).
 Using only the top 5% of the gradients (ranked by magnitude), meProp can train a CNN and MLP on MNIST dataset without accuracy loss.
 We show that the quantized activation values {qi} can further be coded to reduce memory requirements.
 This property is called model compatibility (Park et al., 2018) or machine learning efficacy (Xu et al., 2019).
 Earlier approaches, such as behavioral cloning (BC), relied on training models to mimic expert behavior at various states in the demonstration data (Pomerleau, 1991).
 As known in Han et al., 2015b, large-valued weights tend to have an important role in the prediction.
 Existing defenses propose the use of generalization techniques such as adding learning rate decay, dropout or using adversarial regularization techniques (Nasr et al., 2018b; Salem et al., 2018).
 Studying NP from this perspective, Kim et al., (2019) demonstrates that the under-fitting problem significantly deteriorates the performance of NP.
 The cluster assumption — a special case of the smoothness assumption — states that decision surfaces should lie in low density regions, not crossing high density regions.
 Inspired by momentum and nesterov’s accelerated gradient descent, momentum SGD (MSGD) (Polyak, 1964; Tseng, 1998; Lan, 2012; Kingma & Ba, 2015) has been proposed and widely used in machine learning.
 However, the inputs that may be interpreted as handwritten digits, and hence constitute the \\u201cworld\\u201d of our problem, span but a lower-dimensional manifold within R784 which is not easily defined.
 The noise dominated regime typically arises for small or moderate batch sizes, while the curvature dominated regime typically arises when the batch size is large.
 However, it is also well known that there are limits to the optimality of separate systems in practical settings.
 Given a set of examples drawn from a latent distribution and a set of structural constraints, CANs learn to output valid structured with high probability.
In contrast, the Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) explicitly maximize data likelihood and can be forced to cover all modes (Bozkurt et al., 2018; Shu et al., 2018).
 One simple and seemingly sensible approach to detect a potential OoD input x∗ is to train a likelihood-based DGM (e.g, a VAE, auto-regressive DGM, or flow-based DGM) by (approximately) maximizing the likelihood p(D|θ) of the model parameters θ under the training data D, and to then estimate the probability p(x∗|θ) that x∗ was generated by the model θ (Bishop, 1994): If p(x∗|θ) is large, then x∗ must be in-distribution, and OoD otherwise.
 Although subgraph isomorphism is the key to solve graph representation learning based applications (Xu et al., 2019), tasks of identifying or counting subgraph isomorphisms themselves are also significant and may support broad applications, such as bioinformatics (Milo et al., 2002; Alon et al., 2008), chemoinformatics (Huan et al., 2003), and online social network analysis (Kuramochi & Karypis, 2004).
 There is a growing acknowledgement that this threat model is somewhat contrived: such examples are not a realistic security concern and also occupy a vanishingly small fraction of the set of potential adversarial inputs.
 These methods filter features using a per-feature relevance score that is created based on some statistical measure (Battiti, 1994; Peng et al., 2005; Estévez et al., 2009; Song et al., 2007; 2012; Chen et al., 2017).
 Similarly, we would like to enforce sparsity in our representations via task-specific measures.
 The main limitation of the aforementioned work is the unrealistic assumption that all the data used in the Q-learning algorithm are sampled i.i.d. from a fixed stationary distribution, which fails to capture the practical setting of neural Q-learning.
 The MAP solution can be written as the minimizer of the following loss (negative log likelihood + negative log prior):θ̂MAP = argmin θ L(θ, {xn, yn}Nn=1) = argmin θ− log p(θ)− N∑n=1log p(yn|xn,θ).
 Second, in order to be generally applicable to any model-free environment, underlying dynamical gradients are not used, even if they are available.
A natural solution is to add an auxiliary task with an unsupervised objective to improve sample efficiency.
 One drawback of UAPs though, is the requirement of training data for crafting perturbations.
Algorithm 1 Federated learning. wtk is the model parameters updated by learner k at communication round t, wt is the global model parameters at round t, K = {1, 2, · · · ,K} is the universal set of learners, Pk is the local training dataset of learner k, B is the local minibatch size, E is the number of the local epochs per round, η is the learning rate, and `(·) is the loss function.
 Using the Jacobian mapping associated with the neural network we characterize directions where learning is fast and generalizable versus directions where learning is slow and leads to overfitting.
 We argue that it is disadvantageous to utilize the discriminator as simply a reward function when it is known that gradient-based backpropagation is a far more efficient way to perform credit assignment.
 1 For instance, should the principal give all the reward to the top entry, or does it make sense to give some of the reward to the top entry, and some for the second best? Earlier research has investigated how different contest designs affect the utility of the principal (Archak & Sundararajan, 2009; DiPalantino & Vojnovic, 2009; Gao et al., 2012; Chawla et al., 2015).
 In the following, we will refer to weak (resp. strong) annotations for coarse (resp. accurate) labels and denote them as WL and SL.
Notation: Throughout the paper: N refers to number of training points, d refers to representation dimension, and L refers to number of labels.
Editing sequences poses a different problem from other seq2seq tasks, as in many cases, most of the input remains unchanged and needs to be reproduced.
 Other authors have remarked that batch normalization introduces noise by computing the batch statistics over a subset of the training data, helping generalization (Luo et al., 2019).
 Another line of research focuses on subspace identification (12), where the time series is modeled using a linear state-space and a change is identified using the model parameters.
 Followed by this, it was shown in (Peters et al., 2018) that language modeling is useful in providing deep contextual sentence embeddings that could be fine-tuned on a number of natural language understanding tasks.
 Applied to autonomous driving, groups of pixels classified as OOD would be considered as unknown objects.
 In biomedical information systems, it means possible onset of certain diseases.
 To achieve this, we introduce a novel reward function which, given the references, shapes the distribution of the history states.
 Wisdom et al., (2017) proposed an RNN design (coined Sista-RNN) by unfolding the sequential version ofISTA.
 Doing so learns local features and the degree of locality.
 We implement our idea using two principles: unsupervised feature learning and semi-supervised learning.
 As a result, many important questions remain unclear: how to characterize the factors that influence the tasks for different datasets? how do the different choices of datasets influence the models’ performance?Another way to improve the evaluation strategy is common in our routine experimental design.
 However, in the subsequent construction process, the dynamic of the city has been different from that in the initial stage.
 In addition, Voice cloning is one of the closely related task to VC (Arik et al., (2018)).
The preconditioner is a function that has to be selected properly w.r.t. f to obtain the desired linear convergence.
We approach this problem using compositional set embeddings.
 However, it has been pointed out that this approach does not work for generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL), which is a more general setting where test samples can be from both seen and unseen classes (Chao et al., 2016).
 Q-FP has the advantage of higher dynamic range compared to equivalent Q-FX representations and reduced hardware cost over single-precision floating point (FP).
 The storage pipeline is therefore a natural area to seek improvements in overall training times, which manifest from the storage medium, through the network, and into the compute nodes.
 The rank is upper-bounded by the inner dimensions of Y ,Z>.
 De-noising is an effective approach to improve accuracy under noise but can degrade accuracy for clean images (Na et al., (2019)).
 In some sense, this is the most general representation of a multiset that can be computed incrementally using only a finite amount of memory, and it can be directly implemented inside a neural network.
 In fact, it appears that the distance between train and test distribution may be critical for successful “generalization”.
 However, this option is not scalable, since it requires significant effort.
 The image pair can be consecutive frames of a video sequence, where the local pixel displacements are caused by the relative motions between the agent and the objects in the 3D environment.
 Many visual generative methods based on generative adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., (2014)) as Zhu et al., (2017); Zhou et al., (2018); Huang et al., (2018); Karras et al., (2017); Sangkloy et al., (2017) have demonstrated promising results.
 To enable learning from few examples, various viable meta-learning approaches (Lake et al., 2011; Ravi & Larochelle, 2016; Finn et al., 2017) have been developed.
 In particular, we hypothesize that the structure of sequential data provides a rich source of innate supervision.
 Their approach relies on multivariate extreme value theory (EVT) and is valid under regularity assumptions concerning the multivariate distributional tail which appear to be an homogeneity property above large thresholds: the tail behaviour at infinity is similar to the behaviour of polynomial function near infinity (see equation 1 below).
 That is, si is enough to determine the joint distribution of the ith event and the updated state si+1, which is needed to recursively predict all subsequent events.
This work We extend this technique in two key ways: (i) we demonstrate how to soundly approximate EXACTLINE, handling significantly larger networks faster than even methods based on sampling can (a form of deterministic abstract interpretation), and (ii) we use this approximation to provide guaranteed bounds on the probabilities of outputs given a distribution over the inputs (a form of probabilistic abstract interpretation).
 These processors work together to minimize an objective function.
 The former set of papers argued that the empirical covariance matrix of pre-activations became deterministic in the infinite-width limit and called this the conjugate kernel of the network while the latter papers studied the properties of these limiting kernels along with the kernel describingdistribution of gradients.
 When they are pre-trained on a classification task, they are considered to contain abstract knowledge that can be used as an input to perform further tasks (Vinyals et al., 2015; Karpathy & Fei-Fei, 2015; Xu et al., 2015).
In this paper, we address the problem of memorization with orthogonal RNNs and linear autoencoders.
Most defenses that rely on randomization, either apply randomized transformations to the input, e.g, (Xie et al., 2018), or randomization applied within the network, e.g, on the activations (Dhillon et al., 2018) or on the weights directly (Wang et al., 2018).
 The pooling operation reduces the spatial dimensions of an image and forms a hierarchical abstraction through successive downsampling.
 Recently, Vaswani et al., (2017) proposed Transformer, a model based on the attention mechanism for Neural Machine Translation(NMT).
 In 2017, Raghu et al., (2017) proposed trajectory length as a measure of expressivity; in particular, they consider the expected change in length of a one-dimensional trajectory as it is passed through Gaussian random neural networks (see Figure 1 for an illustration).
However, image processing outputs may not be accurately recognized by image recognition systems.
 Model-free data based methods have also been developed such as DINEOF (Alvera-Azcárate, 2011).
 In particular, this diversity is all the more important in tasks that hinge on the uncertainty output of the ensemble, e.g, in out-of-distribution scenarios (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017; Ovadia et al., 2019).
 However, due to the discrete nature, GANs have difficulty in text generation since the gradients from discriminator can not be passed to generator explicitly and thus most these GANs based models (Yu et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2017; Fedus et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018) treat text generation as a sequential decision making process (Bachman & Precup, 2015) and utilize policy gradient (Williams, 1992) to overcome this difficulty.
 These two perspectives complement each other: strategic perspective is global, static, and often imprecise, while tactical perspective is local, dynamic and exact.
 Empirical findings in (Yan et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016a; Radford et al., 2015) demonstrated that a simple linear interpolation on the learned image manifold can produce smooth visual transitions between a pair of input images.
 In particular, Salimans et al., (2015) proposed a promising modified VI method that reduces approximation bias by using MCMC transition kernels.
 As a concrete example, given a parallel corpus of English and French sentences, English and French become two channels and the corresponding generative model becomes p(English,French).
 Therefore, it is the filter that makes GNNs powerful, and thus the key to designing robust and accurate GNNs is to design proper graph convolutional filters.
 We test our approach on three representative attribution methods of Sliding-Patch (SP) (Zeiler & Fergus, 2014), LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016), and Meaningful-Perturbation (MP) (Fong & Vedaldi, 2017) across two large-scale datasets of ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) and Places365 (Zhou et al., 2017).
In this work, we propose a few shot learning model that targets few-shot regression tasks.
 Staying faithful to the analogy we name such models as Atomic Compression Networks (ACNs).
 What separates this example from the coffee robot that disturbs its owner’s sleep? The collision-alert system alters its data distribution in a way that is aligned with the goal of fewer collisions, whereas the coffee robot’s strategy results in changes that are misaligned with the goal of good coffee-timing (Leike et al., 2018).
 The success of FMs has been evidenced by applications such as click-through rate prediction (Rendle, 2012; Ta, 2015) and recommendation (Rendle et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2017).
 A number of novelty measurement strategies have been proposed in the past few years, such as the use of information gain (Houthooft et al., 2016), count-based methods utilizing counting tables (Bellemare et al., 2016; Ostrovski et al., 2017), and prediction-based methods exploiting prediction errors of dynamics models (Stadie et al., 2015; Pathak et al., 2017; Burda et al., 2019a;b).
 However, such temporal annotations are often ambiguous and expensive to collect.
 In this work, we hypothesize that spatially predictable representations may allow artificial systems to benefit from human-like data-efficiency.
 DFT has proved useful in QM due to its good trade-off between speed of computation and chemical accuracy (Cohen et al., 2012).
 Another interpretation is that this collection of experts represents the worst case scenario for behaviour cloning on how to perform a task “good enough”.
 We assume that words have latent features, e.g, meaning(s), tense, grammatical type, that are innate and fixed, irrespective of what an embedding may capture (which may be only a part, subject to the embedding method and/or the data source); and that this same latent structure gives rise to patterns observed in the data, e.g, in word co-occurrence statistics and in which words are related to which.
On the contrary to supervised deep learning, human beings are capable of learning a new behaviour or concept through the most typical cases rather than accumulative learning for a lot of cases.
 Besides, it is still challenging to tune a cost function with such complicated constraints.
 Recent studies (Micikevicius et al., 2017; Das et al., 2018) have shown that, deep neural networks can be trained using 16-bits of precision without any noticeable impact on validation accuracy across a wide range of networks.
In many scenarios, the true gradient is impossible to compute, however surrogate gradients are available.
This topic also has implications for the study of biological neural networks.
 The result is often a limited generalization capability which largely revolves around adaptation to changes in the object position.
 Many iterative algorithms such as ISTA (Daubechies et al., 2004), FISTA (Beck & Teboulle, 2009; Becker et al., 2011), ADMM (Chartrand & Wohlberg, 2013) and AMP (Donoho et al., 2009) have been proposed to solve it, which can be considered as unlearnable approaches since all the parameters are fixed instead of being learned from data.
 Another potential reason is that real-world graphs are often noisy due to the inevitably error-prone data measurement or collection.
 To this end, we propose the collaborative training algorithm of balanced random forest (CoBRF) to mitigate the challenging problems such as noisy labels, lack of training data, and misaligned or unknown categories (open set categorization).
Differences between audio and vision models Concretely, while an input to a vision model is a raw image, audio models typically come with a complex preprocessing stage (that involves non-trivial non-linear operations such as logarithm) which extracts relevant features from the signal.
 In our work, we generalize this method to also handle perturbations of the parameters of a given transformation (e.g, the angle of a rotation).
 The predictive inference speed has detained BNNs from wide applications.
 Dauphin et al., (2014); Orhan and Pitkow (2017) argue that optimization paths may get close to the singular regions induced by weight-space symmetry and this, in turn, slows down training for deep neural networks.
 KD can only be applied in classification task since the “soft target” is produced by the softmax function with temperature T.
Despite practical advances in finding adversarial examples and defending against them, it is still an open question whether (i) adversarial examples are unavoidable, i.g,no robust model exists, cf. (Fawzi et al., 2018; Gilmer et al., 2018), (ii) learning a robust model requires too much training data, cf. (Schmidt et al., 2018), (iii) learning a robust model from limited training data is possible but computationally intractable (Bubeck et al., 2018), or (iv) we just have not found the right training algorithm yet, i.g,adversarial examples exist because of intrinsic flaws of the model or learning objective that can ultimately be overcome.
 It is known that, even in min-max optimization problems with convex-concave objectives, GDA may fail to compute the min-max solution and may even exhibit divergent behavior.
 Consequently, the word occurrences are modeled in a fine-granularity.
However, in deep reinforcement learning (RL), those conventional regularization methods are largely absent or underutilized in past research, possibly because in most cases we are maximizing the return on exactly the same task as in training.
 For example, annotating a semantic image mask took “more than 1.
 We will call this approaches as experience replay (ER)-based methods in this paper.
 Particularly, a high-level meta-policy could be adopted in the hierarchical framework to choose corresponding low-level primitive skills to complete tasks in order.
 We refer to these biases as human priors.
 Previous approaches are either based on a low-dimensional analysis of the flow field based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), e.g, (Saini et al., 2016), or are based on physically reconstructing missing areas by solving the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, e.g, (Sciacchitano et al., 2012).
 In backward propagation, BNN uses Straight-Through-Estimator (STE) to estimate the backward gradient through the Sign function and update on full-precision weights.
Question 1: Is it possible to compress large-scale language representations such as BERT via weight pruning?Question 2: How would the weight-pruned, pre-trained model affect the performance of the downstream multi-task transfer learning objectives?The problem of weight pruning has been studied under many types of deep neural networks (DNNs) (Goodfellow et al., 2016), such as AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), VGG (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014), ResNet (He et al., 2016), and MobileNet (Howard et al., 2017).
 Second, being three-dimensional (3D) is a decisive property of the physical world.
 In real world scenario, the latency can be only worse (around 700ms) because indirect routing between internet service providers (ISP) and queuing delay in switches.
In this paper we consider deterministic “wait-k” decoders that are state of the art for low-latency decoding (Ma et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2019b).
 From this perspective, instability and mode collapse have been explained with the fact that for finite amounts of data and any continuous distribution G produced by the generator, a sufficiently powerful discriminator will be able to fully maximize the two summands in Equation 1 independently of each other, instead of searching for a trade-off.
 Due to the end-to-end training, interpreting each intermediate layer behaviors of a DNN, which, however, is still not clear.
 Both are valid outcomes.
 Recently, a series of works based on graph convolutional neural networks including ChebyNet (Defferrard et al., 2016), graph convolutional networks (GCN) (Kipf & Welling, 2017), GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017) and graph attention networks (GAT) (Velickovic et al., 2018) have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in node classification and clustering (Kipf & Welling, 2016; Wang et al., 2017) on attributed graphs.
 Depending on their design, the fidelity-based attribution evaluation varies: completeness (Sundararajan et al., 2017), sensitivity-n (Ancona et al., 2018), infidelity (Yeh et al., 2019), and causal local explanation metric (Plumb et al., 2018).
 Goodfellow et al., (2014) demonstrate that,under suitable conditions, GANs learn to generate samples with the same probability distribution as samples in the training data set have.
 For this purpose, we consider the KL divergence between the prior and the posterior distribution of a data point as a score to distinguish inliers and outliers.
Kortge (1990) attempted to encode knowledge for different tasks with minimal overlap via activation sharpening algorithms.
 Clever versions of ANNs have been proposed recently that avoid this criticism: ANNs whose backward weights are random and fixed (Lillicrap et al., 2016) and a variant that also uses random feedback weights but with zero initial conditions (Nø kland, 2016), a backpropagation interpretation of STDP (a widely accepted theory of plasticity) (Bengio et al., 2015), unsupervised learning using STDP (Diehl & Cook, 2015), ANNs driven by neural competition (Krotov & Hopfield, 2019), or ANNs with target value propagation at each layer rather than the loss gradient (Lee et al., 2015).
 In contrast, sentence (1) shares the phrase neural networks with sentence (3) and maple syrup is shared between (2) and (4).
 During training, the networks fit the low complexity components first and thus lie in the concept class of low complexity.
 The sampling variance and the slow convergence of SGD have been studied extensively in the past (Chen et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017; Toulis & Airoldi, 2017).
 Since the above mentioned generative models are usually trained using some gradient-based technique, this means that they cannot be directly applied as compression models, as quantization will destroy the learning signal, and hence a workaround is needed.
The ability of overparameterized deep networks to overfit noise while generalizing well suggests the existence of some kind of regularization in the learning process.
 Hence, it has become a hot research topic to design exploration strategy, and many exploration methods have been proposed in recent years.
Can machines also understand previously unseen choices and subsequently use them for solving tasks? From a reinforcement learning perspective, this brings an interesting question of how to enable generalization of discrete action policies to solve tasks using unseen sets of actions.
 The homoscedastic model will underestimate noise in certain regions which could induce a Bayesian Optimisation scheme to suggest values possessing large aleatoric noise.
 In contrast, as noted by Bianchi et al., (2019), one of the primary benefits of the ARMA filters over polynomial ones is that ARMA filters are not computed in the Fourier space induced by a graph Laplacian, and as a result, ARMA filters are local in the node space and enable to more flexibly and accurately capture the underlying graph topology.
 1.Accurately predict labels for the unlabelled part of the data using a set of supervised classifiers trained upon a small labelled dataset.
 However, model-based methods are typically limited to low-dimensional tasks or settings with certain assumptions imposed on the dynamics (Li & Todorov, 2004; Deisenroth & Rasmussen, 2011; Levine & Koltun, 2013; Chebotar et al., 2017)Several recent works have learned dynamics models parameterized by deep neural networks (Lenz et al., 2015; Finn & Levine, 2017; Williams et al., 2017), but such methods generally result in high-dimensional models which are unsuitable for planning.
 In particular, the core component of AdvCodec is a tree based autoencoder which converts discrete text tokens into continuous semantic embedding, upon which the adversarial perturbation will be optimized regarding the chosen adversarial target.
 In practice, many challenges arise with this approach, such as the computational expense of sampling during inference, how to pick an appropriate weight prior, or even how to learn such a representation given your prior.
 On the other hand, MSEE aims to search for a policy such that it maximizes the entropy of state distribution.
The lower-bound approximation of the log-likelihood provides a feasible solution for VAE.
(2) Even for the same data sample, different sub-structures may have different task dependency.
 Subsequently, this pre-trained model has to be deployed in three target hospitals - one in the US (Tus1) and two in China (Tcn1 and Tcn2).
 In this work, we show that in RC undersensitivity can be probed with automatically generated natural language questions.
 The initialized layers can range from the single word embedding layer Peters et al., (2018) to the whole model Howard & Ruder (2018).
In this work we constructed new protein representations combining different levels of abstraction.
 While this yields competitive results, it wastefully employs a separate NLI model for each language (Lample & Conneau, 2019).
 Random projections are attractive for BO because, by the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, they can be approximately distance-preserving (Johnson & Lindenstrauss, 1984) without requiring any data to learn the embedding.
 Deep linear networks provide an excellent mathematical framework for developing insightful theoretical understanding of the complex inner workings of deep nonlinear networks (Goodfellow et al., 2016).
 It is extremely challenging to perform fine-grained multi-label classification on both codes with labeled data (seen codes) and zero-shot (unseen) codes at the same time.
 Optimal schemes classically involve the inference of the considered covariance-based priors from irregularly-sampled data.
 One scalable potential approach that does not require ensembling many models nor the computational costs of relation networks, is to meta-learn an initialization.
 However, the implicit staleness introduced due to the asynchrony limits the parallelization of the approach, often leading to degraded performance.
 Employing semi-supervised learning can even counteract the noisy labels (Laine & Aila, 2016; Luo et al., 2018).
sequence such as the syntactic parsing tree.
 However, despite the high representational capacity of DL models, the extraction of good features remains challenging.
 Several advanced graph pooling methods, such as SORTPOOL (Zhang et al., 2018), TOPKPOOL (Gao & Ji, 2019a), DIFFPOOL (Ying et al., 2018), and SAGPOOL (Lee et al., 2019) , are recently proposed and achieve promising performance on graph classification tasks.
Recently, the seminal work namely deep graph matching (DGM) (Zanfir & Sminchisescu, 2018) is proposed to exploit the high capacity of deep networks for graph matching, which achieves stateof-the-art performance.
 Especially, in the case of few-shot learning, where a small number of training nodes are labeled, this kind of methods would drastically compromise the performance.
 This is also the core idea behind generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) (Ho & Ermon, 2016), which implements IRL using generative adversarialnetworks (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Finn et al., 2016a).
 Overall, at the moment, there is no dominant deep learning solution for tabular data problems, and we aim to reduce this gap by our paper.
 The noise derives from the limited transferability of source-domain features, the unknown number of target-domain identities, and the imperfect results of the clustering algorithm.
 Unfortunately, machines are still unable to effectively learn new classes without manual annotations.
 This issue is particularly problematic under function approximation, and can significant impede the quality of the learned policy (Thrun & Schwartz, 1993; Szita & Lőrincz, 2008; Strehl et al., 2009) or even lead to failures of Q-learning (Thrun & Schwartz, 1993).
 We define this novel problem Unsupervised Federated Domain Adaptation (UFDA), as illustrated in Figure 1(a).
 Our work considers a variety of mechanisms to estimate the network depth and applies a different layer at each step.
 This is not efficient in finding sparsity and may sacrifice the flexibility of the trained model.
 To reduce randomness, the search using each policy, i.g,, random and NAS ones, is repeated several times, with different random seeds.
 First, the sampling procedure is stochastic and the VAE samples can fail to cover some minor modes even with a large number of samples.
 Despite the success and popularity of SGD with momentum, its convergence had been an open problem.
 However, in all previous work, the tasks in the stream are essentially the same task but in different domains.
 Another important example is that the government wants some companies to invest on the poverty area to achieve the fairness of the society, which may inevitably reduce the profits of companies.
 Nonlinear transformations are applied to the representation passed from one node to another, called a message.
 However, as studied in (Nguyen et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2017), for DNNs with conventional (also referred as ‘vanilla’) training to minimize the softmax cross-entropy loss, the outputs do not contain sufficient information for well-calibrated confidence estimation.
 In the Hilbert space associated with κ, larger determinant implies larger spanned volume, thus the mapped points tend not to be similar or linearly dependent.
 Recently, learning the underlying structure across tasks provides a more effective way for balancing the customization and generalization.
Most of the existing methods highly depend on the model structure and require model-specific analysis in new applications, which makes it important to develop black-box inference and learning methods.
 And this paper focuses on the quantization of neural networks.
 In MIL, data consists of bags of instances and their corresponding bag level labels.
 These recent advances have largely alleviated the catastrophic forgetting, at least with a small number of tasks.
 Indeed, catastrophic forgetting is one of the main pathologies in continual learning (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989; Ratcliff, 1990; Robins, 1993; 1995; French, 1999; Pape et al., 2011; Goodfellow et al., 2014a; Achille et al., 2018; Kemker et al., 2018; Kemker & Kanan, 2018; Diaz-Rodriguez et al., 2018; Zeno et al., 2018; Ahn et al., 2019; Parisi et al., 2019; Pfulb & Gepperth, 2019; Rajasegaran et al., 2019).
 For example, on CVRP with 100 customers, LKH3 is able to produce an average cost of 15.65, but with an extremely long∗Equal contribution.running time of 13 hours (Kool et al., 2019).
 Cross-encoders must recompute the encoding for each input and label; as a result, they are prohibitively slow at test time.
 To reduce different amounts of redundancy among different weight kernels, these kernel-wise network quantization techniques should have searched a QBN for each kernel of each layer in a CNN.
 To our best knowledge, there is no related work in the literature examining whether these NAS architectures share any pattern, and how the pattern may impact the architecture search if there exists the pattern.
 For instance, Karkus et al., (2017) trained an agent to navigate in a partially observable grid world under the model-free setting, i.g,, the agent can only observe a part of the grid world and does not learn the transition function.
 Another deficiency is that, the combination of off-policy learning, bootstrapping, and function approximation, making up what Sutton & Barto (2018) called the "deadly triad", can easily lead to unstable or even divergent learning (Sutton & Barto, 2018, Chap.11).
 Firstly, MI is invariant under reparametrization of the variables — namely, if X ′ = f1(X) and Y ′ = f2(Y ) are homeomorphisms (i.g, smooth invertible maps), then I(X;Y ) = I(X ′;Y ′).
 This is partially caused by multiple confounding factors for RL generalization that can be hard to identify and separate.
 As the transformation is random, by feeding in samples of the transformed image through the CNN, we accumulate a set of CNN softmax outputs and predictions.
 A good quantization method should resolve the two following questions/challenges, which correspond to two contradictions respectively.
A limitation of CFR is that it requires traversing the whole game tree in each round, which is timeconsuming in large-scale games due to the fact that we have to apply RM to every immediate regret in each round.
Given the same training data, DNNs with different starting conditions usually converge to different knowledge representations, which sometimes leads to the over-fitting problem (Bengio et al., 2014).
 This enables at least coarse approximation of view-dependent effects.
 Some practical suggestions based on these findings have also been proposed to further improve the generalization ability of deep networks (Neyshabur et al., 2015a).
However, existing studies are restricted to dealing with unstructured text as the evidence, which would not generalize to the cases where the evidence has a highly structured format.
 Another challenge arises from the high variance inherent in policy gradient methods, which can be ameliorated through control variates such as in T-MAML (Liu et al., 2019), through careful adaptive hyperparameter tuning (Behl et al., 2019; Antoniou et al., 2019) and learning rate annealing (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017).
 In UTM, both data and programs that manipulate the data are stored in memory.
 However, planning to reach temporally distant goals is difficult.
This paper considers networked MARL (NMARL) in the context of networked system control (NSC), where agents are connected via a communication network for a cooperative control objective.
Decoder: This turns the latent space back into a set.
First, we briefly mention related work (§2).
 The pathbased (Xiong et al., 2017; Das et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2018; Wang, 2018) attempts to construct an explanatory path to model an iterative decision-making process using reinforcement learning and recurrent networks.
 Another category of these attempts is to apply various non-linear transformations, e.g, different operations of image processing (Guo et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2018; Raff et al., 2019).
 Indeed, more independence may lead to higher reconstruction error in some models (Higgins et al., 2017a; Kim & Mnih, 2018).
As others have proposed, compositional generalization can be assessed using a train-test split based on observable properties of the examples that intuitively correlate with their underlying compositional structure.
 These methods either directly impose the AT mechanism on the SCE loss or add additional regularizers.
 At the limit of infinitesimal initialization of the deep linear network, Gidel et al., (2019) show these dynamics exhibit a behavior of “incremental learning” - the singular values of the model are learned separately, one at a time.
 The encoder itself can therefore fail to generalize, and although the information bottleneck minimizes mutual information with the input on the training data, it might not compress successfully on new inputs.
 Expectedly, the notion of irreversibility plays a central role in the discourse.
 Recent works (Geirhos et al., 2019; Zhang & Zhu, 2019) further show that adversarially trained models capture more on global structure features but normally trained models are more biased towards local features.
 This caused CNNs to come with significant drawbacks: a lack of trust in their classifications, missing interpretability of learned features in the application domain, and the absence of hints as to what data could enhance performance (Molnar (2019)).
 In many cases, however, this is expensive, unethical, or even infeasible.
 This new algorithm for option discovery, deep covering options, is computationally tractable and it is applicable to environments with large (or continuous) state-spaces.
 While standard VAEs tend to capture all modes, they often generate ambiguous images on multimodal real data distributions.
 It is natural to make the hypothesis that such higher-order relationships are essential to extracting the full predictive power of data, across many domains.
 Alternatively, it is easy for the user to provide success-or-failure feedback, while exploratory interaction is useful for learning how to perform the task.
 For example, as shown by our analysis later in §4, an attack on objection detection needs to succeed consecutively for at least 60 frames to fool a representative MOT process, which requires an at least 98% attack success rate (§4).
 However, correctly estimating the noise transition matrix is challenging.
 Adversarial training can be regarded as a data augmentation technique that trains DNNs on adversarial examples, and can be viewed as solving the following min-max optimization problem (Madry et al., 2018):min θ1n n∑ i=1 max ‖x′i−xi‖p≤ `(hθ(x ′ i), yi), (1)where n is the number of training examples and `(·) is the classification loss, such as the commonly used cross-entropy (CE) loss.
As we are particularly interested in scalable RL algorithms that can be applied to multi-task settings where a single agent must perform a wide variety of tasks, we show for the case of discrete actions that the proposed algorithm surpasses previously reported performance in the multi-task setting for both the Atari-57 (Bellemare et al., 2012) and DMLab-30 (Beattie et al., 2016) benchmark suites, and does so reliably without population-based tuning of hyperparameters (Jaderberg et al., 2017a).
Therefore, we propose a novel method which tweaks a conventional neural network into a complexvalued one, such that intermediate-layer features are released without sacrificing input privacy too much.
 Yet, has not not theoretically clear whether Nesterov SGD accelerates over SGD.
 Nevertheless, for a given model complexity, pre-training by using an off-theshelf annotated image datasets such as ImageNet remains much more efficient.
 The disentanglement of the representation of such methods exhibit a large variance and while some models turn out to be well disentangled it appears hard to identify them without supervision (Locatello et al., 2019b).
 Such a notion of parameterisation redundancy has so far remained unexplored, despite its potential connections to the structure of the loss landscape, as well as to the literature on neural network capacity in general.
 Then, if such approximation is good enough, that is, p(x|M) ≈ p∗(x), OOD inputs should yield a low likelihood under modelM.
 Nevertheless, the insight brought by such results can also be limited.
 Another application of IDA is a quick adaptation to new domains.
 Otherwise humans must hand-design a curriculum for the agents, which requires domain knowledge and is time-consuming, especially as tasks and environments grow in complexity.
 The role of attention as a means of recovering input-output mappings, and various types of explanatory insights, is currently the focus of much research and depends to a significant extent on both types of identifiability.
 In shooting algorithms, the agent randomly generates action sequences, use the dynamics to predict the future states, and choose the first action from the sequence with the best expected reward.
We develop an algorithm that learns a value function that extrapolates to unseen states more conservatively, as an approach to attack the optimistic extrapolation problem (Fujimoto et al., 2018a).
 To further simplify the analysis, we only consider the expected learning dynamics in continuous time as opposed to the online algorithm with sampling.
 However, the situation is different for language data where most tasks operate at the lexical level.
Despite the wide use of stochastic momentum (Algorithm 1) in practice, 1 justification for the clear empirical improvements has remained elusive, as has any mathematical guidelines for actually setting the momentum parameter—it has been observed that large values (e.g, β = 0.9) work well in practice.
 They cannot add noise to arbitrary pixels, or make a building disappear.
 Videos of real-world interactions are plentiful and readily available, and a large generative model can be trained on large unlabeled datasets containing many video sequences, thereby learning about a wide range of real-world phenoma.
 GSTs are non-trainable GCNs comprising a cascade of graph filter banks followed by nonlinear activation functions.
As unstructured text encodes a great deal of information about the world, large-scale pretraining over text data holds the promise of simultaneously learning syntax, semantics and connecting them with knowledge about the real world within a single model.
 In most network architectures, a prediction for a single input depends on all model parameters.
 However, this approach is inherently limited as there are simple cases where history-based methods cannot generalize∗Work completed during an internship at Google. 1As Moore’s Law ends, prediction techniques in these fields have also stagnated.
 Despite a handful of preliminary successes, we observe that the successful human domain expertise in designing segmentation models appears to be not fully integrated into NAS frameworks yet.
 The DSGAN is a generative approach.
 Several online or stochastic algorithms forAUC maximization have been developed based on a convex surrogate loss (Zhao et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2013; Ying et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Natole et al., 2018).
 It cannot be formally guaranteed whether the resulting model is also robust against other attacks.
 Recent work (Jetley et al., 2018; Gilmer et al., 2018b) argue that adversarial examples can exist within the data distribution, which implies that detecting adversarial examples based on an estimate of the data distribution alone might be insufficient.
The majority of the current detection mechanisms focus on non-adaptive threats, for which the attacks are not specifically tuned/tailored to bypass the detection mechanism, and the attacker is oblivious to the detection mechanism.
 Unfortunately, this method can be impractical when decision-making requires a long-term memory because dimension of observation become unacceptably large if a long history is included.
 One simple way to exploit the best policy information is that we reset the policy parameter of each learner with that of the best learner at the beginning of the next M time steps; make each learner perform learning from this initial point for the next M time steps; select the best learner again at the end of the next M time steps; and repeat this procedure every M time steps in a similar way that PBT does (Jaderberg et al., (2017)).
So far, an array of recent work (Havrylov & Titov, 2017; Mordatch & Abbeel, 2018; Kottur et al., 2017; Foerster et al., 2016) has shown that in many game settings, the neural agents can use their emergent language to exchange useful coordinating information.
 And transfer-based attack is weak in targeted attack.
 As a result, a typical “large-scale” test set for image classification allows for tens of thousands of naturalimages to be examined, which are deemed to be extremely sparsely distributed in natural image manifold.
 To be specific, mixout(u) replaces all outgoing parameters from a randomly selected neuron to the corresponding parameters of u. mixout(u) avoids optimization from diverging away from u through an adaptive L2-penalty toward u.
Theoretical analyses of reinforcement learning fall into two broad categories: those assuming a simulator (a.k.a. generative model), and those without a simulator.k.a
 The classifier input is a positive `1 sparse code of scattering coefficients calculated in a dictionary D.
 The absence of worst-case performance analysis can potentially be a glaring problem depending on the application.
 This paper presents results that improve this understanding.
 When we test novelty detection schemes on the blurred data generated by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), we found that the novelty detection schemes assign higher confidence to the blurred data than the original data.
 By contrast,Neural networks with arbitrary depth and arbitrary piecewise linear activations (excluding linear functions) have infinitely many spurious local minima under arbitrary continuously differentiable loss functions.
 AR models based on recurrent (G)NNs can be viewed as special instantiations of SSMs in which the state transitions are restricted to being deterministic (Fraccaro, 2018, Section 4.2).
 In the PS setting, a central task is to design a synchronization policy, which coordinates the execution progress of all workers.
 Recently, Yang et al., (2018) proposed applying mean-field theory (Stanley, 1971) to solve large-scale multiagent learning problems.
 In the current implementation, the motion is taken as the trajectory of the center of mass of that character in the frame.
 Hence, choosing safe examples from the noisy dataset with small-loss criteria may be impractical.
 Consequently, in both theory and practice, iVAE inevitably leads to a suboptimal solution, which renders the learned model far less identifiable.
 In particular, given an example, a set of k most likely labels are predicted for the example.
 In the common case of non-negative rewards, this means Q-values are initialised to their lowest possible values, i.g,, a pessimistic initialisation.
 Also, due to the task-specific model design, it is difficult to benefit from pre-training, where the pre-training task may well be different from the target.
We argue that the awareness of deformations emerges from adaptivity – the ability to adapt at runtime (Kanazawa et al., 2016; Jia et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019).
 Knowledge uncertainty, also known as epistemic∗Equal Contributionuncertainty (Gal, 2016) or distributional uncertainty (Malinin & Gales, 2018), is uncertainty due to a lack of understanding or knowledge on the part of the model regarding the current input for which the model is making a prediction.
 For this reason, all the above mentioned works were forced to use homogeneous workers in a dedicated network, which serves to reduce the variance in the workers’ iteration times.
 How to leverage trained deep generative architectures to perform such extrapolations is an open problem, largely due to the non-linearities and high dimensionality that prevent interpretability of computations performed in successive layers.
In addition to showing that our model can learn physical parameters without object or state supervision (a task with intrinsic scientific interest in and of itself), we show that incorporating dynamics priors in the form of known physical equations of motion with learnable parameters together with learnable vision and graphics can improve model performance in two challenging tasks: long term video prediction and visual model predictive control.
 Successful applications include collaborative filtering (Hsieh et al., 2017), few-shot learning (Snell et al., 2017), and multi-goal reinforcement learning (Schaul et al., 2015).
 We include in this context all model parameters, such that traversing from one scale (in which all parameters are known) to another requires no additional resources for specifying the model (e.g, architecture search/design).
 Hence researchers have also considered learning semantic parsers from denotations (Berant et al., 2013; Yih et al., 2015), where training data consists of pairs (q, A), where q is a natural-language question and A is the desired answer.
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to learning loop invariants by modeling the loop behavior from program execution traces with a new type of neural architecture.
This work was done when the first author was an intern at Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab, London, United Kingdom.important to keep in mind, as an improvement in any of these elements will lead to a better final performance.
 This allows video prediction models to serve as a generative pre-training strategy of feature representation learning for a variety of downstream supervised tasks.
 However, this task only considers three types of simple logical relationships and only needs reasoning at sentence-level.
 Each block itself is composed of multiple residual modules with space-time convolutional layers, learning spatio-temporal representations.
 In fact, if the actual goal is learning good latent representations, evaluating generative models only based on reconstruction fidelity and subjective quality of typical samples is neither sufficient nor entirely necessary, and can be even misleading.
However, the VAE framework is still far from delivering the promised generative mechanism, as there are several practical and theoretical challenges yet to be solved.
 This raises a natural question: How to design an effective backbone dedicated to detection tasks?To answer this question, we first draw a link between the Effective Receptive Field (ERF) and the computation allocation of backbone.
 In this paper, we present a novel technique to generate insightful visualizations for pre-trained agents.
 GNNs can be used to solve node classification (Kipf & Welling, 2017) and link prediction (Zhang & Chen, 2018) tasks, or they can be applied to downstream graph classification (Bacciu et al., 2018).
 Furthermore, there is theoretical reason to expect that, as the number of parameters increases, the distance from initialization decreases.
 Among them, Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015), which dynamically adjusts the step size and the update direction by exponential average of the past gradients, has been extensively popular and successfully applied to many applications (Xu et al., 2015; Gregor et al., 2015; Kiros et al., 2015; Denkowski & Neubig, 2017; Bahar et al., 2017).
 In such applications, the statistics of the current data distribution are of particular interest.
Such improvements are consistent with our hypothesis that the use of appropriately applied multiplicative interactions can provide a more suitable inductive bias over function classes leading to more data-efficient learning, better generalization, and stronger performance.
Nevertheless, the problem posed by extremely scarce novel-class samples in the few-shot setting remains to persist as a formidable challenge, as it requires more rounds of aggregation to affect larger neighborhoods and hence necessitate greater depth in the GNN.
 Most of existing imitation learning methods fall in the following two categories:• Behavioral Cloning (BC, Pomerleau (1991)).
One security vulnerability of transfer learning is that pre-trained models, also refereed to as teacher models, are often publicly available.
 An evidence is that when they are applied to documents out of the domain of the training data, their performance drops dramatically, as will be seen in our experiments; and (2) it is difficult to collect enough training data for a new domain or a new language, as human effort is expensive.
 Additionally, arbitrary panning unlocks the possibility to adjust for different inter-pupillary distances of various persons.
 Besides, such models are designed to only operate at the sentence-level (i.g,, single tree), limiting their application to document-level processing.
 In a mean-field game, each agent has the same cost function and state transition, which depend on the other agents only through their aggregated effect.
 However, a set of properties must be known in advance, which might not always be possible.
 This avoids the need in GANs to numerically solve a saddlepoint problem.
 Perhaps the synthesizer is given a few pairs of lists of integers, and the user hopes that the synthesizer will produce a sorting function.
 To overcome this issue, Temporal Segment Network (TSN) (Wang et al., 2016) was proposed.
 The new algorithm, deep skill chaining, scales to high-dimensional problems with continuous state and action spaces.
 Existing photo compression standards, like JPEG, optimize for human perception alone and aggressively remove weak micro-signals already at the device.
Duo to the lack of the theoretical underpinnings, there is neither guarantee that warmup would bring consistent improvements for various machine learning settings nor guidance on how we should\\u2217Work was done during an internship at Microsoft.
 Instead of imposing heuristic metrics that have no relationship to the system dynamics, we quantify the distance between two states in terms of the number of time steps needed to transition between them.
 The meta-learner then learns a task-specific classifier on the support data and the classifier predicts on the query data.
 GLIDER then explicitly encodes the collected global interactions into a target model via sparse feature crossing.
As in the approach proposed in this work, human visual perception is not passive.
 However, this too is problematic because now the assessment relies on two measures which can make it difficult to compare models.
 Several methods are proposed to explicitly encourage the network to take into account input latent codes to encode diversity.
To date, most approaches for training low precision networks have employed uniform quantizers, which can be configured by a single step size parameter (the width of a quantization bin), though more complex nonuniform mappings have been considered (Polino et al., 2018).
 Figure 1 illustrates the kinds of transformations we explore.
 Certain categories (such as ‘building’ or ‘sky’) can appear∗Work done while interning at ElementAIwith two orders of magnitude more frequently than others (e.g, ‘pedestrian’ or ‘bicycle’).
 To estimate the magnitudes and signs of the gradient, the community at large has formulated a continuous optimization problem of O(n) complexity where n is the input dimensionality.
Unlike the standard unsupervised AD setting, in many real-world applications one may also have access to some verified (i.g,, labeled) normal or anomalous samples in addition to the unlabeled data.
 This is particularly true for those pursuing research directions that require a massive number of training runs, such as hyper-parameter tuning (Li et al., 2017) and neural architecture search (Zoph & Le, 2017; Cao et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019).
 Most approaches (Charikar, 2002; Jegou et al., 2011) aim to learn compact lower-dimensional representations that preserve distance information.
Two approaches have been proposed to reduce the variance.
 As derived by Ho & Ermon (2016), this divergence minimization may be achieved by iteratively performing two alternating steps, reminiscent of GAN algorithms (Goodfellow et al., 2014).
 This algorithm, with deep neural networks as the underlying model, has been highly influential, with significant follow on work, such as first order variants (Nichol and Schulman, 2018), probabilistic extensions (Finn et al., 2018), augmentation with generative modelling (Rusu et al., 2018), and many others (Hsu et al., 2018; Finn and Levine, 2017; Grant et al., 2018; Triantafillou et al., 2019).
 Exploiting the robustness of SELFIES (Krenn et al., 2019), we do not need to incorporate any expert based mutation or cross-over rules.
 Known bounds for deep nets normalize the output margin by a quantity that either scales exponentially in depth or depends on complex properties of the network (Neyshabur et al., 2015; Bartlett et al., 2017; Neyshabur et al., 2017b; Golowich et al., 2017; Nagarajan and Kolter, 2019; Wei and Ma, 2019).
Several reasons for exactly why neural text is degenerate have been posited, with the cause currently unknown.
However, these models are formally non-identifiable (Hyvärinen & Pajunen, 1999; Locatello et al., 2019) and this implies that repeated training runs will not reliably discover the same latent attributes.
 This suggests that underdetermination is a key threat to reliability in deep learning, and motivates flexible methods that can detect underdetermined predictions cheaply.
 During the inference phase when a trained model is deployed for task-solving, prediction-evasive attacks are plausible (Biggio & Roli, 2018; Goodfellow et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2018), even when the model internal details are unknown to an attacker (Chen et al., 2017; Ilyas et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2019a).
 Examples of this include learning models for word prediction on cell phone data (McMahan et al., 2018), clinical predictions using hospital records (Zhang et al., 2019), and fraud detectors for competing credit card companies (Stolfo et al., 1997).
 Omniglot is a dataset of 1623 handwritten characters from 50 different alphabets and contains 20 examples per class (character).
Central to the above is designing the scoring function f .
 The “model” is a dynamics model, used to plan under the user-supplied reward function.
 Second, while there are methods for multi-agent credit assignment when all agents share a single goal (i.g,, a global reward) (Chang et al., 2004; Foerster et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2018), and while one could treat the cooperative multi-goal scenario as a problem with a single joint goal, this coarse approach makes it extremely difficult to evaluate the impact of an agent’s action on another agent’s success.
 Our contributions are twofold:
In this paper, we consider the most challenging and practical attack setting – hard-label black-box setting – where the model is hidden to the attacker and the attacker can only make queries and get the corresponding hard-label decisions (e.g, predicted labels) of the model.
 To solve this problem, we first question the very statistical guarantees which the aforementioned optimization passes rely on.
 These illusions arise in the circuit from recurrent interactions between neural populations with receptive fields that tile visual space, leading to contextual (center/surround) effects.
 Our study focuses on image representations, so we explore various means of learning representations that are local and compositional for convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
 It is usually assumed (Gu et al., 2018) that knowledge distillation’s reduction of the “modes” (alternative translations for an input) in the training data is the key reason why distillation benefits NAT training.
 However, current attacks do not fully exploit the distributed learning methodology of FL, asthey embed the same global trigger pattern to all adversarial parties.
 Our goal is to propose a sampling-free method which uses probabilistic propagation to deterministically learn BNNs.
 It has even been difficult to tackle a simpler task: characterizing when specific changes to common normalization approaches might yield benefits.
 Recently, one of the most important applications of ZO optimization is the black-box adversarial attack to welltrained deep neural networks, since in practice only input-output correspondence of targeted models rather than internal model information is accessible (Papernot et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017a).
 To combat this, they wait for only a few rollout workers, and then asynchronously optimize the model.
 More precisely, this approach fits confidence estimates of the formfφ̂,τ (y | x) ∝ exp(τ log fφ̂(y | x)),where τ ∈ R>0 is a temperature scaling parameter that is fit based on the validation dataset.
 Existing studies mainly focus on static quantization, in which the precision of each weight and activation is fixed prior to inference (Hubara et al., 2017; He et al., 2016b).
NMNs perform well on synthetic visual question answering (VQA) domains such as CLEVR (Johnson et al., 2017) and it is appealing to apply them to answer questions over text due to their interpretable, modular, and inherently compositional nature.
 The parameters of this function are estimated by a ‘higher order’ encoder network, thus motivating the name for our method: Higher-Order Function networks (HOF).
 VHE by construction has the ability to generate texts given images.
 Now, what if there exists a new task? This drives us to ask: how to get a suitable architecture for a new task in NAS? Generally, there exist two simple solutions in handling multiple tasks.
 Further, an agent must be able to perform commonsense reasoning—IF games assume that human players possess prior commonsense and thematic knowledge—e.g, knowing that swords can kill trolls or that trolls live in dark places.
 One particularly promising line of work in this area focuses on learning the dynamics and conducting control in a low-dimensional latent embedding of the observation space, where the embedding itself is learned through this process (Watter et al., 2015; Banijamali et al., 2018; Hafner et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019).
 Inspired by previous work on the more general tasks of program synthesis and learning to execute (Zaremba & Sutskever, 2014; Kaiser & Sutskever, 2015; Kurach et al., 2015; Reed & De Freitas, 2015; Santoro et al., 2018), we show that by learning several algorithms simultaneously and providing a supervision signal, our neural network is able to demonstrate positive knowledge transfer between learning different algorithms.
 The success of deep compression (Han et al., 2016) and filter pruning (Luo et al., 2017) suggest that there is considerable redundancy in the parameter space of filters of CNNs.
 Hence, such methods are not directly applicable for tasks such as link prediction which require relation embedding vectors.
 As an alternative, one can use exclusively observational data and rely on different assumptions which make the graph identifiable from the distribution (see Section 2.2).
Is it possible that something similar happens with GD? We believe so.
 The reason hippocampal memories are kept separated is to minimize interference between experiences, which allows us to recall specific events in the form of ’episodic’ memories (Eichenbaum & Cohen, 2004; Squire et al., 2004).
Most open-vocabulary DST models rely on autoregressive encoders and decoders, which encode dialogue history sequentially and generate token ti of individual slot value one by one conditioned on all previously generated tokens t1:i−1.
 CTRNN dynamics evolves as follows:τ ġ(t) = −αg(t) + φ(Ug(t) +Wx(t) + b), t ≥ t0.
 The initial lottery ticket hypothesis, which was validated on comparatively small networks, proposed that small, sparse sub-networks found via pruning of converged larger models could be trained to high performance provided they were initialized with the same values used in the training of the unpruned model (Frankle & Carbin, 2019).
 They can be roughly divided into two categories: some of them try to improve vanilla BN by correcting batch statistics (Ioffe, 2017; Singh & Shrivastava, 2019), but they all fail to completely restore the performance of vanilla BN; Other methods get over the instability of BN by using instance-level normalization (Ulyanov et al., 2016; Ba et al., 2016; Wu & He, 2018), therefore models can avoid the affect∗Equal Contribution.
 This motivates us to consider efficient protocols for distributed learning in bandit problems.
 Training data manipulation research typically examines the impact of changing the input distribution during testing and observing the effect on ANN performance.
 Arora et al., (2018) studied the trajectory of gradient flow and showed that depth can help accelerate the optimization of deep linear networks.
Data with multiple input variables often exhibit some structure.
 Originally designed for classification problems, common wisdom suggests that this method may be effective only when a good fraction of the predictions on unlabeled samples are correct, otherwise mistakes are going to be reinforced (Zhu & Goldberg, 2009).
Inference for multivariate spatial point processes intensities is still a challenging problem (Taylor et al., 2015), especially with a large number of subprocesses.
 First, inference is restricted to a finite dictionary of types that have been observed during training time—i.g,, they cannot predict any user-defined data types.
 This is due to factors that are clearly*Equal contributionunrelated to one’s voice, such as lighting, glasses, and orientation, that also exist in the natural face image.
 Despite our 2-dimensional visual input, and despite never having been supplied a bounding box or segmentation mask as supervision, our ability for 3D perception emerges early in infancy (Spelke et al., 1982; Soska & Johnson, 2008).
 Another direction is to enhance recognition performance of the tail classes by transferring knowledge from the head classes (Wang et al., 2017; 2018; Zhong et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019).
 There are many types of environment perturbations.
 Such models rely on the explicit parametrization of importance.
 Such label corruption significantly degenerates the generalization performance of deep models.
 In other settings—including federated learning (FL) (McMahan & Ramage, 2017;McMahan et al., 2017), which is the motivation and focus of this work—the data cannot be inspected.
 It is shown that ensembles of models perform at least as well as its individual members and diverse ensemble members lead to better performance (Krogh & Vedelsby, 1995).
 Each neuron then adapts its parameters based on the temporal differences of its ”forward” and ”backward” activity.
Our contributions.
 Chen et al., (2015) proposed a nonlinear diffusion process for image restoration and de Bezenac et al., (2018) incorporated the transport physics (advection-diffusion equation) with deep neural networks for forecasting sea surface temperature by extracting the motion field.
 The method, known as ‘Bits Back with Asymmetric Numeral Systems’ (BB-ANS) was demonstrated by compressing the MNIST test set using a variational auto-encoder (VAE) model (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014), achieving a compression rate within 1% of the model ELBO.
In our paper, we show that the algorithm IMPACT realizes greater gains by striking the balance between high sample throughput and sample efficiency.
 Moreover, MLE requires target sequences for training, while for many scenarios in task-oriented dialogue (Williams & Young, 2007) and program synthesis (Zhong et al., 2017), only the final rewards to the generated sequences are available.
On the other hand, a solid theoretical understanding of training stability has not been established.
 The latter approach is more robust, as it does not require modeling assumptions about the real world’s dynamics.
 In effect, oversmoothing hurts classification performance by causing the node representations to be indistinguishable across different classes.
 This is nontrivial since the test error is much smaller than the error rate in training data.
 We distinguish two categories of factors of variations.
 Our results show that incorporation of such physics-based inductive bias offers insight about relevant physical properties of the system, such as inertia, potential energy, total conserved energy.
 Although these penalty∗Work done when interning at ByteDance.
1 Most solutions, however, assume that the energy pattern for each appliance is unique and known, and use this knowledge to create labeled data for their supervised models. (Kolter et al., 2010; Zhong et al., 2014; 2015; Kelly & Knottenbelt, 2015; Zhang et al., 2018; Bonfigli et al., 2018).
 While these spaces can approximate any regular (e.g, bounded Lipschitz) function up to arbitrary accuracy, the norm of the approximators can be exponentially large in the feature dimension for certain non-smooth but very simple functions such as a single ReLU (Yehudai & Shamir, 2019).
 To tackle this challenge, one can simplify the game by grouping similar states together to solve the simplified (abstracted) game approximately via tabular CFR (Zinkevich et al., 2007; Lanctot et al., 2009).
 Compared to monolingual BERT which exhibits no zero-shot transfer, multilingual BERT differs only in that (1) during pre-training (i.g, masked word prediction), each batch contains sentences from all of the languages, and (2) it uses a single shared vocabulary, formed by WordPiece on the concatenated monolingual corpora (Devlin et al., 2019).
Despite their common use to explain agent behavior, it is unclear whether saliency maps provide useful explanations of the behavior of deep RL agents.
This work We present a new approach for program synthesis from examples which addresses the above challenge.
 In this paper, we address this bottleneck and propose a novel alternative strategy for system identification.
 However, these two conflicting factors make it is difficult to improve strength and lower correlation simultaneously.
 It is believed that adhering to the original hyperparameters for fine-tuning with small learning rate prevents destroying the originally learned knowledge or features.
 AM helped with preparing datasets for discriminator training, automated evaluation, running experiments, and writing the manuscript.
 Many techniques are available for learning the relationship between 2D images and 3D objects.
A major issue with identifying reduced inputs is the combinatorially large space of arbitrary text deletions; this can only be searched exhaustively for short sequences.
Adversarially trained models gain robustness and are also observed to produce more salient Jacobian matrices (Jacobians) at the input layer as a side effect (Tsipras et al., 2018).
 The variance of the accuracies is extremely large in fig. 1
 Specifically, Lecuyer et al., (2019) and Cohen et al., (2019)∗Work done during an internship at DeepMind.
 The original KD objective introduced in (Hinton et al., 2015) treats all dimensions as independent, conditioned on the input.
 What is worse, such systems are highly susceptible to bias, because it is generally very hard to define a minimum and comprehensive axiom set for training.
 Although proxy tasks, i.g,, smaller models and reduced datasets, are taken to accelerate the searching process, tens of thousands of GPU-hours of consumption are still required.
 However, these approaches are all limited in that they do not explicitly aim to lower the generalization error on the test examples.
 We say a decision-making process suffers from disparate treatment if its decisions discriminate against individuals of a certain protected group based on their sensitive/protected attribute information.
 It has been increasingly applied to problems in domain adaptation and transfer learning (Seguy et al., 2017; Genevay et al., 2017; Courty et al., 2017b; Li et al., 2019).
 We posit instead that for each budget, there exist more powerful mixed-blocktype networks that assign non-uniform importance to each block by cheapening them to different extents.
 This, however, does not imply that the annotators are not trustworthy, but rather that these tasks are difficult even for domain experts.
 Weak supervision can allow one to build models that have interpretable representations even when human labeling is challenging (e.g, hair style in face generation, or style in music generation).
 However, as pointed by Dziugaite and Roy (2017), empirical correlation does not necessarily translate to a casual relationship between a measure and generalization.
 This is a nonconvex optimization problem which makes computing the exact solution challenging, and thus several algorithms are recently proposed to find the lower bounds of Eq. (1) in order to efficiently obtain a safety guarantee (Gehr et al., 2018; Weng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2019).
 Although both DeepSets and PointNet are known to be invariant universal (i.g,, can approximate arbitrary invariant continuous functions) they are not known to be equivariant universal (i.g,, can approximate arbitrary equivariant continuous functions).
Local SGD.
The general task of unpaired domain translation can be informally described as follows: given two probability spaces X and Y which represent our domains, we seek to learn a mapping G : X→ Ysuch that a sample x ∈ X is mapped to a sample G(x) ∈ Y whereG(x) ∈ Y is the best representative of x in Y .
 First, it has undesirable convergence properties: it fails to converge to some local minimax and can converge to fixed points that are not local minimax (Jin et al., 2019; Daskalakis and Panageas, 2018).
Meanwhile, existing CL methods can be classified into three different categories (Parisi et al., 2019): regularization, replay, and expansion methods.
 For instance, the node representations of the lynx and the orca in Figure 1 are indistinguishable due to an isomorphic equivalence between the nodes, making any edge prediction task that distinguishes the edges of lynx and orca a seemly futile exercise (see Appendix (Section 7) for more details).
 Both models are miscalibrated: all TransE combinations in Figure 1a under-forecast the probabilities (i.g, probabilities are too small), whereas ComplEx under-forecasts or over-forecasts according to which loss is used (Figure1b).
 It is not desirable that users get different average of predicted ratings just because they have rated different number of movies (regardless of their actual rating values).
 It does exist if we apply a deep GCN on small graphs (see 4-layer GCN on Cora in Figure 1).
 Therefore, the pre-processing steps such as image cropping and alignment are often required to avoid these problems by limiting the complexity of the data distributions (Huang et al., (2018); Liu et al., (2017)).
 It is known that models with increased capacity, for example increased model depth (He et al., 2016) or width (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016), generally help increase model performance when properly regularized.
In this paper, we extend the information bottleneck method to the unsupervised multi-view setting.
 Formalizing such knowledge is challenging in its own right and would require careful analysis for each modality and downstream task.
 The way of applying differential privacy is to add random noise to the input data or the data analysis procedure, such that the output difference caused by the input difference can be hidden by the noise.
 We consider two different objectives: 1) minimize running time, subject to not exceeding device memory limits, and 2) minimize peak memory usage.
While use of learning for exploration is well motivated, casting the exploration problem as an end-to-end learning problem has its own drawbacks.
Prior works have tried to overcome these vulnerabilities by proposing various defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks.
 From a neuro-psychological viewpoint, this resembles a hierarchical composition from low- to high-level features akin to the recognition-by-components model by Biederman (1987), a viewpoint which is also adopted in work on capsule networks (Hinton et al., 2011; Sabour et al., 2017).
 Following DeTone et al., (2018b) and Christiansen et al., (2019), we propose a self-supervised methodology for jointly training a keypoint detector as well as its associated descriptor.
 If well-chosen groups of weights are dropped simultaneously, the resulting small sub-networks can be very efficient.
 Our study is done in the context of only two languages, source (typically English) and target (multiple, quite different languages).
 This type of representation provides flexible segmentation maps that can handle objects and background segments of complex morphology.
 Bourgain theorem (1985) 6 proved that it is possible to construct an O(log(n))-dimensional Euclidean embedding of an undirected graph with n nodes with finite distortion.
 GNN-based methods typically require sufficient labeled instances on specific end tasks to achieve good performance, however, knowledge graphs have the long-tail nature (Xiong et al., 2018), i.g,, a large portion the relations in only are a few triples.
 Inaccuracies in the MPC predictions can reduce its effectiveness (and robustness) as the forecast diverges from the physical system trajectory over long horizons.
 We here study CHOCO-SGD—recently introduced for convex problems only (Koloskova et al., 2019)—which overcomes these constraints.
 However, for agents with continuous actions, the above strategies can not be directly applied.
 Self-attention was first added to CNN by either using channel-based attention (Hu et al., 2018) or non-local relationships across the image (Wang et al., 2018).
 However, learning state stationary distribution requires detailed information on distributions of the behavior policy, and we call them policy-aware methods.
 The inner RL algorithm is continually adapting to its input stream of states and rewards, attempting to learn a policy that optimizes the discounted sum of proxy rewards \\u2211 k\\u22650 \\u03b3 kr\\u0302t+k.
 An environment has sparse reward when a non-zero reward is only seen after taking a long sequence of correct actions.
 The inductive setting is what was originally proposed by Vinyals et al., (2016), in which only dlt is used to generate a model.
 (1) Detection of worst-case outliers in the form of adversarial examples; (2) Detection of average-case outliers in the form of ambiguous inputs and (3) Detection of incorrectly labeled indistribution inputs.
 The simplest is fully supervised - for each training image both the class and content are given as labels.
 Using a combination of different constant curvature spaces, Gu et al., (2019) aim to match the underlying geometry of the data better.
Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a flexible framework for black-box optimization that can harness modern deep generative sequence models.
 On the other hand, for black-box attacks, there are various techniques that have been used which do not require access to the model architecture.
 However, they have focused on relatively simple tasks with a single goal (e.g, multi-armed bandit, locomotion, navigation, etc.).
 We first collect a set of hidden activation values by feeding the original input to the autoencoder.
 Accordingly, the training process of a neural network amounts to finding the optimal control forces exerted on a dynamic system to minimize a specific energy form.
According to Elman (Elman, 1990)’s study, the recurrent neural networks was shown to be sensitive to regularities in word order in simple sentences.
 Our second contribution is a method for bridging most of the remaining gap, which boils down to minimizing the discrepancy between the output of the binary and the corresponding real-valued convolution.
For example, in classification, it reduces to cross-entropy loss.
 Stamoulis et al., (2019a) propose to use different kernel sizes in each layer of the supernet and reuse the weights of larger kernels for small kernels.
 After discussing related work (Section 2) and background on homotopy methods (Section 3), our contributions are as follows:
 A seminal work is the InfoMax principle (Linsker, 1988), where given an input instance x, the goal of the InfoMax principle is to learn a representation Eψ(x) by maximizing the MI between the input and its representation.
In this paper, we mainly focus on the efficient inference scenario for mobile devices, where the total number of Mult-Adds is constrained to be lower than 500M.
 Representational cost appears to play an important role in generalization performance; indeed Mei & Montanari (2019) show that minimum norm solutions are optimal for generalization in certain simple cases, and recent work on “double descent” curves is an example of this phenomenon (Belkin et al., 2019; Hastie et al., 2019).
Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT) (Miyato et al., 2019) is a semi-supervised learning method for improving robustness against local perturbations of the input.
 It may facilitate a variety of applications in NLP systems.
 The assumption brings severe limitation in practical scenarios: Imagine that a robot with a low speed limit navigates through a maze by imitating another robot which moves fast, then, it is impossible for the slow robot to execute the exact actions as the fast robot.
To motive our approach, we first review the key idea and limitation of existing 3D part segmentation methods.
Recent work based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014a) have introduced unrestricted attacks (Song et al, 2018).
 Spectral normalization is the most effective normalization method, in which weight matrices in the discriminator are divided by an approximation of their largest singular value.
 In more detail:Continuous functions (cf. Theorem 1.5).
 As a probabilistic temporal generative model, it can learn object-wise structured representation while modeling underlying stochastic temporal transitions in the observed data.
Defending against stealing attacks however has received little attention and is lacking.
 This has been the focus of recent work (Tzeng et al., 2017; Bermúdez-Chacón et al., 2018; Rozantsev et al., 2018; 2019), where source and target data pass through two different networks with the same architecture but different weights, nonetheless related to each other.
 Therefore, Gaussian models become unsuitable particularly in learning regimes involving high uncertainties where one cannot assume local linearity of the underlying space.
 Unfortunately, in counterpart to the human visual system, CNNs do not exhibit equivariance to other transformations encountered in visual data (e.g, rotations).
 STE allows the gradients to be backpropagated through the quantizers and, thus, the network weights can be adapted with standard gradient descent (Hubara et al., 2016).
In this paper, we present an algorithm that inherits the cheap gradient updates from negative sampling while still preserving much of the gradient signal of the original softmax regression problem.
 To address this issue, Ying et al., (2019) introduced NAS-Bench-101, a large tabular benchmark with 423k unique cell architectures, trained and fully evaluated using a one-time extreme amount of compute power (several months on thousands of TPUs), which now allows to cheaply simulate an arbitrary number of runs of NAS methods, even on a laptop.
 While deep ensembles can be related (Rubin, 1981) to Bayesian inference in settings where the individual models are trained on subsets of the data, this is not how they are used in practice.
 For example, Oymak (2018) studied the state equation of recurrent neural networks and showed that SGD can efficiently learn the unknown dynamics from few observations under proper assumptions.
 Besides, as FID and KID are based only on extrinsic properties they are unable to compare unaligned data manifolds.
 Compared to stealing a trained model (including all the weights), stealing the architecturalThis work was done when Michael Davinroy was a research intern at the Maryland Cybersecurity Center. details that make the victim DL system novel provides the benefit that the new architectures and pipelines are usually applicable to multiple tasks.
 Of all the techniques, conversion from ANN-to-SNN (Diehl et al., 2016; 2015; Sengupta et al., 2019; Hunsberger & Eliasmith, 2015) has yielded state-of-the-art accuracies matching deep ANN performance for Imagenet dataset on complex architectures (such as, VGG (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) and ResNet (He et al., 2016) ).
 We present a new class of adversarial examples that target not only the classifier output label, but also the certificate.
 MILk in particular has shown better quality/latency trade-offs than fixed policy approaches, such as wait-k (Ma et al., 2019) or wait-if-* (Cho & Esipova, 2016) policies.
 Our key intuition is that these per-sample gradients contain task-relevant discriminative information.
 The pretrained source weights serves as a starting point when training on the target data.
 Taking ISTA as an example, we know that 1) it converges very slowly with only a sublinear rate (Beck & Teboulle, 2009), 2) the correlation between each of the two columns of A should be relatively low.
 Besides, Wu et al., (2019a) reported that graph NNs achieved comparable performance even if they removed intermediate non-linear functions.
 There has been some recent progress based on neural message passing algorithms Gilmer et al., (2017); Xie & Grossman (2018), which learn the representations of entire graphs in a supervised way.
 (2)The samples S can be sampled independently or using alternatives such as stratified sampling which reduce variance to increase the speed of learning.
 To summarize, our contributions are the following:
 White-box methods such as Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) (Goodfellow et al., 2014), Basic Iterative Method (BIM) (Kurakin et al., 2016), Projected Gradient Decent (PGD) (Madry et al., 2018) and Carlini and Wagner (CW) (Carlini & Wagner, 2017) often suffer from low transferability in a black-box setting, thus posing only limited threats to DNN models which are usually kept secret in practice (Dong et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2019).
 Rui Wang was partially supported by JSPS grant-in-aid for early-career scientists (19K20354): “Unsupervised Neural Machine Translation in Universal Scenarios” and NICT tenure-track researcher startup fund “Toward Intelligent Machine Translation.”text-only NMT (Fadaee et al., 2017; Lample et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019).
 The generalization ability to unseen domains, however, is of critical importance due tothe difficulty to construct large training datasets for rare classes (e.g, , recognizing rare bird species in a fine-grained classification setting).
Each framework has its advantages and disadvantages, and Parisi et al., (2019) provide an excellent survey of these methods.
 For example, consider demographic parity, which requires the classifier to be independent of the group membership attribute.
 Various papers such as Goetschalckx & Ratliff (1990) show labor efficiency to be a bottleneck.
 The WL test works by constructing a labeling of the nodes of the graph, in an incremental fashion, and then decides whether two graphs are isomorphic by comparing the labeling of each graph.
 Theoretical approaches to understanding deep networks also increasingly focus on the early part of the optimization trajectory (Li et al., 2019; Arora et al., 2019).
 One routine involves grouping low-level visual features with their neighbors according to Gestalt laws like similarity, good continuation, etc. (fig.  1b, top; Jolicoeur et al., 1986; 1991; Pringle & Egeth, 1988; Roelfsema et al., 1999; Houtkamp & Roelfsema, 2010; Houtkamp et al., 2003; Roelfsema et al., 2002).
 Mathematically speaking, a correlated signal is generated by a convolution: b = k ∗ x = Kx (as illustrated in fig.  1 right), where k is the kernel and K is the corresponding convolution matrix.
 General unsupervised translation has not typically been considered style transfer, but for the purpose of comparison we also conduct evaluation on this task (Lample et al., 2017).
 Ingmar obtained the first results of tool use, contributed to environment variants, created domain-specific statistics, and with Bowen created the final environment.
 (1) Different search space is utilized, e.g, different macro skeletons of the whole architecture (Zoph et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2019) and a different operation set for the micro cell within the skeleton (Pham et al., 2018), etc.
However, pre-training on graph datasets remains a hard challenge.
 First, it can correctly deal with the diversity in knowledge selection of conversation.
 The exact manner of performing this trade-off, however, is left to be encoded in an acquisition function (AF).
 The d × p embedding matrix thus becomes a substantial, often dominating, part of the parameter space of a learning model.
 Instead of supervising rules and instance labels independently, we propose that each labeling rule be attached with exemplars of where the rule correctly ’fires’.
 Extending GNNs to model them directly is not straightforward since GNNs solely rely on pairwise distances, which ensures their invariance to translation, rotation, and inversion of the molecule, which are important physical requirements.
 An important property of deep learning is that it generalizes well even though its parameter size is quite large compared with the sample size (Neyshabur et al., 2019).
To overcome the synchronization bottleneck, asynchronous training (A-SGD) has been proposed (Dean et al., 2012; Recht et al., 2011).
 The existing theory assumes knowledge of the intrinsic problem dimension, but this is unrealistic for anything but artificially generated datasets.
 This is a difficult and labor-intensive task.
routine, i.g,, training a large model fully, pruning it and then retraining the pruned model to restore the performance (the process can be iterated several rounds).
In this paper, we seek to understand whether deep learning theories accurately capture the behaviors and network properties that make realistic deep networks work.
 Peters et al., (2018) propose an improvement by adding a reverse objective that also predicts the word token that precedes the context.
 To meet it, existing MPNNs adopt permutation-invariant aggregation functions which treat all “messages” from neighborhood as ∗This work is conducted partially during his visit at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
 There are many practical scenarios where a collection of sampled trajectories is available, having been collected off-line by an external mechanism that chose states and recorded the subsequent next states.
 It runs E steps of SGD in parallel on a small sampled subset of devices and then averages the resulting model updates via a central server once in a while.

 A BaB algorithm consists of two key components: branching strategies and bounding methods.
 These dynamics are likely to possess some structured forms in various settings, such as being governed by partial differential equations.
 Additionally, employing a value network as a baseline function only marginally decreases the variance of gradient estimates compared to using true value as a baseline (but still dramatically increases agent\\u2019s performance compared to using no baseline at all).
 Furthermore, for multi-class classification, we may want to treat the learning for each class differently to handle class imbalance.
 Therefore, computational prediction of RNA secondary structure becomes an important task in RNA research and is useful in many applications such as drug design (Iorns et al., 2007).
 Extending into the temporal setting, we further empirically demonstrate the generality of target-embedding for recurrent, multi-variate sequence forecasting.
Do large Transformer models fundamentally require such huge resources or are they simply inefficient? Consider the following calculation: the 0.5B parameters used in the largest reported Transformer layer account for 2GB of memory.
 Moreover, the dependence of this exploration process on the human eye to identify “interesting” patterns is strongly limiting further advances.
 Given an image of a railway locomotive, the attribution map might highlight the train tracks instead of the train itself.
 Each layer of a capsule network represents and detects instances of a set of components (of a visual scene) at a particular semantic resolution.
that are almost indistinguishable from real data.
 This relates to the notion of stationarity.
 This setting raises a natural question: can we leverage ideas from both, adversarial training techniques and provable defense methods, so to obtain models with high accuracy and certified robustness?This work: combining adversarial and provable defenses In this work, we take a step towards addressing this challenge.
One shortcoming of FedAvg is coordinate-wise averaging of weights may have drastic detrimental effects on the performance of the averaged model and adds significantly to the communication burden.
 In this paper, we intend to teach machine agents to realize and utilize useful priors to generalize to new tasks without finetuning.
 We illustrate the power of DRNets for disentangling two overlapping handwritten Sudokus (Multi-MNIST-Sudoku) (see fig. 1) and for solving a substantially more complex de-mixing task in scientific discovery that concerns inferring crystal structures of materials from X-ray diffraction data, which we refer to as Crystal-Structure-Phase-Mapping.
To solve the composition optimization including the finite-sum structure in (1.1), two most straightforward approaches are the gradient descent (GD) and the stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
 Moreover, He et al., (2018a) studied the expressiveness of these decision boundaries at perturbed inputs and showed that these boundaries do not resemble the boundaries around benign inputs.
A typical approach for these types of problems are agents based on deep neural networks including recurrent hidden states, which encode the relevant information of the history of observations Mirowski et al., (2017); Jaderberg et al., (2017).
 However, several approaches in adversarial attacks fail to enforce the semantic relatedness that ought to exist between the inputs and their adversarial counterparts.
 There are three appealing perspectives in terms of their simplicity and effectiveness: 1) Examples weighting.
 In sum, there are multiple elements in deep learning that contribute to reduce overfitting and thus improve generalization.
 These methods, however, have difficulty scaling up to complex neural networks with multiple stochastic layers: low-variance unbiased estimators are too expensive 1 , while the compounded bias from the continuous relaxations on multiple stochastic layers leads to poor minima.
 To address this problem, we propose the X-Forest.
 In this scenario, the lack of any known structure between features to be used as a prior would lead to the use of a fully-connected multilayer perceptron network (MLP).
 Methodologically, while a globally interpretable model fits a single inherently interpretable model (such as a linear model or a shallow decision tree) to the entire training set, locally interpretable models aim to fit an inherently interpretable model locally, i.g,for each instance individually, by distilling knowledge from a high performance black-box model.
 Different methods (Ngiam et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2019) have demonstrated the importance of carefully selecting the most relevant samples to minimize this mismatch.
 Nevertheless, they still have some limitations, and the quality could be further improved (see fig.  1 (a)).
 Anchors are regression references and classification candidates to predict proposals for two-stage detectors or final bounding boxes for single-stage detectors.
 To better adapt the optimization process of gradient descent, GoogleNet (Szegedy et al., 2015) adopted parallel modules, and Highway networks (Srivastava et al., 2015) utilized gating units to regular the flow of information, resulting in multipath and elastic topologies.
 Further, Madry et al., (2017) formalize the adversarial training as the following minimax optimization problem:minθ 1 n ∑n i=1  maxδi∈B `(f(xi + δi;θ), yi)  , (1)where {(xi, yi)}ni=1 ⊂ Rd × Y are n pairs of input feature and the corresponding label, ` denotes a loss function, f(·;θ) denotes the neural network with parameter θ, and δi ∈ B denotes the perturbation for xi in constraint B.
 Deep Audio Prior (DAP)’s capability to train on a single audio file has several advantages.
 Simple probabilistic predictions or pseudo labels may not accurately represent the semantic information of input instances, misleading the alignment.
 Secondly, to learn to “master” the environment potentially helps the agent to learn to achieve goals in sparse reward settings.
 Therefore, the recommendation systems may suffer overfitting, and their performance may degrade accordingly, especially in the initial phase of deployment.
The gradient descent process can be described by a system of first-order differential equations in the continuous-time limit, in the form of ẋ(t) = H(t)x(t).
 A standard and popular means to alleviate this nuisance is noisy data augmentation in training, i.g,a DNN is exposed to noisy input images during training so as to bolster its robustness during inference.
 More recently, it was shown that such adversaries can also be as simple as Gaussian noise (Bibi et al., 2018).
 But we also compare different selectivity measures on specific units in VGG-16 (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014) and GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al., 2015) trained on the the ImageNet and Places-365datasets that were characterized by Zhou et al., (2018a) as “object detectors” based on their Network Dissection method (Zhou et al., 2018a).
 However, for one thing, there are not so much theoretically supported or potent procedure for tackling the issue of training SNNs, which limits SNNs from going deeper, therefore SNNs hardly fulfill the ability in real-world complex missions, such as video-based recognition/detection, natural language pro-cessing et al..
 In this paper we provide sufficient conditions on the data, initialization, and over-parameterization for dynamically normalized ReLU networks to converge to a global minimum of the loss function, and rigorously illustrate the utility of normalization methods.
 GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., (2017b)), a hierarchical sampling and aggregating framework, successfully leverages feature information to generate embeddings of the new nodes.
 Second, due to their heuristic nature, generalizing the methods is difficult.
 Thirdly, our setting is general enough to cover amortised inference.
 Static channel pruning approaches aim to design a measurement to evaluate the importance of each channel over the whole training dataset and remove the least important channels to minimize the loss of performance after pruning.
 In the first stage, the segmentation network is trained using the labeled images.
 Here, the loss function of a deep neural network is reformulated as a nested function associated with multiple linear and nonlinear transformations across multi-layers.
 Using the skeleton by itself will generate images that lack variability as it restricts the representation to that specific skeleton itself.
 One of the first GAN models for sound synthesis have been designed to first produce the spectrogram (or some other similar intermediate representations) (Donahue et al., 2019; Engel et al., 2019; Marafioti et al., 2019).
We focus on inherently-interpretable deep neural network modeling with the foundations of prototypical learning.
 Such observation can be used to inform policy, achieve accountability and direct on-the-ground action, e.g, within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (Jensen & Campbell, 2019).
 However, these RL policies are usually not transferable and require training a new policy from scratch for each individual graph.
 For example, graphlet kernel (Shervashidze et al., (2009)) is based on the Kelly conjecture (see also Kelly (1957)), anonymous walk kernel (Ivanov & Burnaev (2018)) derives insights from the reconstruction properties of anonymous experiments (see also Micali & Allen Zhu (2016)), and WL kernel (Shervashidze et al., (2011a)) is based on an efficient graph isomorphism algorithm.
 Take batch normalization module (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) for example, its pervasiveness in both academia and industry is undoubted.
 In this work, we focus on the distillation utilizing the network outputs Hinton et al., (2015); Furlanello et al., (2018); Yang et al., (2018a); Bagherinezhad et al., (2018); Yang et al., (2018b).
The main original contributions of this work are:
 The variational distribution is often constructed with some special structures to reduce the number of variational parameters and speed up the computation.
 These post-processing methods, whilst very effective and appealing, are derived from heavy assumptions on the representation geometry and the similarity measure.
 In this paper, we want to leverage the power of deep representations in order to compute feature descriptors that are robust across multiple views.
 However, the standard BN procedure only normalizes the features to ensure that they have the same mean and variance.
To avoid costly exact differential evaluations, many works explore the finite-sum structure of problem (1) and develop stochastic cubic regularization approaches.
 At earlier timesteps, prediction of infection may be more reliable than mortality, thus we may want knowledge transfer to happen from task infection to mortality; at later timesteps, we may want the opposite situation to happen.
 Both previous works (Vaswani et al., 2017; Popel & Bojar, 2018), as well as our empirical study, show that such a warm-up stage is essential in training the models.
 However, the success of BatchNorm is indisputable, therefore there may exist a profound mathematical mechanism behind BatchNorm.
 However, exact calculation is intractable as p(a|z) is unknown in general.
 Formally, consider multiple instances of a single environment that differ in their state transition dynamics, e.g, independent ant robots with different leg designs in Figure 1, which reach different locations by executing the same walking actions.
In this work, we focus on field data, i.g,dense grids of scalars, similar to images, which were generated with known partial differential equations (PDEs) in order to ensure the availability of ground truth solutions.
In this study, we propose graph warp module (GWM), a supernode (Li et al., 2017; Gilmer et al., 2017; Battaglia et al., 2018) based auxiliary module that can be attached to generic GNNs of various types to improve its representation power.
 First, when the gradient of the loss function does not consider the normalization to a hypersphere, a large part of the gradient is lost when points are re-projected back to the sphere, especially in the easy-positive/hard-negative cases of triplets including nearby points.
 Other methods have developed specific grounding or attention modules that aim to attend to the correct region(s) for generating visually groundable word.
In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a novel differentiable PDE layer (PDEL) that efficiently enforces spatial PDE constraints for neural networks, at costs on par with a single CNN layer.
Simply combining existing DP-preserving mechanisms and provable robustness conditions (Cisse et al., 2017; Kolter & Wong, 2017; Raghunathan et al., 2018) cannot solve the problem, for many reasons.
We wish to improve the efficiency of similarity search.
 However, RNN is a mapping from a sequence space to another sequence space and the current output depends on both current input and the whole observation history.
 Deng et al., (2016a) proposed an end-to-end formula recognition method for images generated directly from LaTeX code.
 Specifically, we consider the line of sparse reward problems that employ partially observable inputs, with the inputs scaling to high-dimensional state spaces, such as images.
 In this paper, we propose AutoGrow that can automate depth discovery given a layer architecture.
 It is well recognized that devising these architectures is non-trivial and requires engineering expertise.
 As illustrated in Figure 1 for the image synthesis task, given an image, we first compute a heatmap via a deep network whose local maxima correspond to locations of interest.
 Among all existing certifiable defensive techniques, randomized smoothing emerges as the most popular one due to its scalability to large datasets and arbitrary networks.
 However, current methods for solving these tasks often rely on simple heuristics (e.g,1For reproducibility, the code and trained models will be released accompanying this paper.uniform averaging), resulting in significant performance drops when comparing to our proposed min-max optimization framework.
 During the process of learning the new task, the originally learned knowledge will typically be disrupted, which leads to catastrophic forgetting.
 Recently, lifelong learning methods based on episodic memory (Lopez-Paz et al., 2017; Chaudhry et al., 2018b; d’Autume et al., 2019) such as A-GEM (Chaudhry et al., 2018b) are shown to be able to achieve the state-of-the-art performance across several benchmarks.
 Scaling-translation-equivariant (ST -equivariant) CNNs, on the other hand, have typically been studied in a less general setting in the existing literature (Kanazawa et al., 2014; Marcos et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2014; Ghosh & Gupta, 2019).
In this work, we propose a new pruning framework, called MaskConvNet, to address the above mentioned issues simultaneously.
 Most of these models are linear and thus ignore some important non-linear correlations among the OD flows.
 Thus, we argue that an efficient representation is extremely crucial to the sample efficiency.
 With input-independent dropout regularization, each neuron has no choice but to encode generic information for all possible inputs, since it does not know what input and tasks it will be given at evaluation time, as each neuron will be retained with fixed rate regardless of the input.
 The data is embedded in the Euclidean space (Stemmer & Kaplan, 2018), which causes the failure on clustering non-convex clusters (Beliakov & King, 2006).
Until recently, CNF has mostly been trained using unlabeled data.
 Analogously to how generalization bounds for standard learning algorithms reveal the role of dataset size in generalizing to new datapoints, our bound reveals the roles of both dataset size (m) and number of datasets (n) in generalizing to new tasks.
 Quantization has the following three advantages over other techniques.
 Our goal is to find a generator such thatDreal = Dg .
 Prior work includes various methods that find the justification in an input text — also called rationale or mask of a target variable.
It can be well captured by CNN, because of the position invariance of CNN.
 The minimization problem is to search for the optimal discriminator f that can distinguish two distributions as much as possible and the maximization problem is to find the optimal generator g such that the discriminator can not find the difference.
 Another line of research is to pose the problem of disease progression estimation as an optimization problem.
 We directly impose these constraints through a suitable parameterization of the feasible set.
 Hence it is tempting to speculate that the methods for deep learning that work so well for artificial neural networks also play a role in the brain (Marblestone et al., 2016; Scholte et al., 2017).
 What is the representation power of neural networks for expressing the Qfunction, the policy, and the dynamics? How do the model-based and model-free algorithms utilize the expressivity of neural networks?Our main finding is that even for the case of one-dimensional continuous state space, there can be a massive gap between the approximability of Q-function and the policy and that of the dynamics:The optimal Q-function and policy can be significantly more complex than the dynamics.
 To overcome this problem, Zhu et al., (2017b) proposed BicycleGAN, which learns to encode the distribution of different possible outputs into a latent vector z, and then learns a deterministic mapping G : (A, z)→ B.
A key component of attention mechanisms is the transformation that maps scores into probabilities, with softmax being the standard choice (Bahdanau et al., 2015).
 This strategy is used in inverse problems, where the input to the network is a set of observations/measurements (e.g, x-ray tomography, ultrasound) and the output is the set of parameters of interest (tissue density etc.) Feigin et al., (2018); Lucas et al., (2018); McCann et al., (2017); Seo et al., (2019).
 Inevitably, adversarial examples generated by existing optimizationbased approaches (Carlini & Wagner (2018)) could involve non-negligible perturbation on the silent and pause positions, which would affect the quality of adversarial examples and alert the users.
 This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that different optimizers such as SGD or Adam work best on different datasets and require very different learning rate schedules.
 FastGCN employs a random layer-wise node sampling (Chen et al., 2018b).
 TS algorithm for binomial bandit could achieve optimal regret bound as well Kaufmann et al., (2012).
 The other direction is to explicitly model domain specific characteristics with a multi-stream network structure where different domains are modeled by corresponding sub-networks at the cost of significant extra parameters and computations Rozantsev et al., (2018b).
 In particular, the need to directly operate on existing data with domain knowledge prevents many previous data augmentation strategies from being applicable to more general settings.
 Indeed, while models are trained on inaccurate data, they are evaluated on their ability to predict event occurences as precisely as possible with respect to the ground-truth.
 There are mainly two types of methods to perform convolution on a graph: spectral methods and non-spectral methods.
When dealing with multiple source domains, one may attempt to directly use these approaches by combining all source data into a large joint dataset and then apply one-to-one adaptation.
Unlike other approaches, BERT also provides a multilingual contextual representation which is enabled by its shared sub-word vocabulary and multilingual training data.
Our study is particularly motivated by the design of data poisoning and evasion adversarial attacks from black-box machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) systems, whose internal configuration and operating mechanism are unknown to adversaries.
In this work we introduce a simple continual learning algorithm for fixed capacity networks which can be trained using standard gradient descent methods and by construction suffers zero deterioration on previously learned problems during the training of new tasks.
 The benefits of our compressed TT–layer are twofold.
 These advances, in addition to novel pre-training tasks, relied on bigger models with a larger embedding size.
Skerry-Ryan et al., (2018) augment a Tacotron-like model (Wang et al., 2017) with a deterministic encoder that projects reference speech into a learned embedding space.
 More concretely, at a given time step in generating the output sequence, the model is conditioned either on ground-truth or model prediction from the previous time-step with some probability.
 The above analogic relations can be used, including adding difference vector−−−−−→woman−−−→man to −−→ king to transfer −−→ king to −−−→queen.
 For Imagenet, the norms of the mini-batch gradients are typically quite small and well concentrated around their mean.
One very successful area of applying generative models to the sciences has been the field of drug discovery (Jin et al., 2018; Gómez-Bombarelli et al., 2018; Assouel et al., 2018) (see Schwalbe-Koda & Gómez-Bombarelli (2019) for an excellent summary of many methods).
 In this paper we focus on knowledge distillation, an idea proposed by Hinton et al., (2015) in a teacher-student framework.
 However, as some past work has argued, NAS is an optimization problem – find the architecture with the lowest validation error – so there is no explicit need to maintain a state and transition function, and this approach may require evaluating a larger number of architectues to achieve the same result as other methods (Kandasamy et al., 2018; Elsken et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2017).
The key observation we have is that most prior literature in this space studies quantization for fixed network architectures, which is reasonable for evaluating the effectiveness of quantization algorithms, but unnecessary when considering the Pareto efficiency (accuracy vs. model size) of neural networks.
 The intuition is that if a model can generate a good approximation of the data then it must have learned something about its underlying representation.
 One approach is to express the data distribution in an auto-regressive pattern (Papamakarios et al., 2017; Oord et al., 2016); another is to express it as an invertible transformation of a simple distribution using the change of variable formula, where the invertible transformation is defined using a normalizing flow network (Dinh et al., 2014; 2016; Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018).
 Meanwhile, we expect the model could generate novel behaviour, i.g,, unseen motion in training set.
 With the increase in the number of network layers, the size of the receptive field is also constantly increasing.
(Ormazabal et al., 2019) propose using joint learning as a means of mitigating these issues.
 Label scalability denotes scalability to graphs with many node/edge labels.
 If we are to use the model as it is, one must at least understand when the model is going to work and when it is not, to have some confidence metric that tells about the expected performance of the methods when applied to our problem.
 Several training approaches have been proposed on this model, e.g, training with RL controller (Pham et al., 2018), training by applying dropout (Bender et al., 2018) or architecture weights on candidate choices (Liu et al., 2018c).
 The ‘unofficial’ open source release of BigGAN works around this by accumulating gradients across 8 different V100 GPUs and only taking an optimizer step every 8 gradient accumulation steps.
 However, most researchers could not be fully convinced from only above explanation because it is just a part of whole.
 These graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches usually consist of two common phases: the propagating phase and the readout phase.
 On the other hand, `2 regularization is often utilized for correlated weights as some low-pass filtering, sometimes in the form of weight decay (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) or early stopping (Yao et al., 2007; Wei et al., 2017).
 Most of them require significant amount of computational cost, which is normally orders of magnitude higher than training a network.
 For that purpose, we use a measure of the discrepancy between the estimated state value and the observed returns.
 This is because of the fact that, in morphologically rich languages, dependency relation exists between not only orthographic words (space-delimited tokens) but also relation within the word itselfNivre (2013).
 They found that this threshold varies across different patient groups (context).
 The performance of a Continual Learning algorithm can then be measured with two protocols : multi-head or single-head.
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) was first used in medical imaging.
 In general, it is difficult to design a decoder that balances the efficacy of the graph generation and the simplicity of the implementation and training.
 Since a nonnegligible accuracy drop is inevitable in extreme quantization, some papers have proposed increasing the number of channels to compensate for the lack of expressivity (Lin et al., 2017).
 Our setting is as follows: we assume a fixed input y0 to an L layer neural network with weights given by W , and intermediate output for any layer l denoted by yl.
 Deep VIB (Alemi et al., 2017) leads to improved generalization, adversarial robustness and model compression algorithms (Dai et al., 2018).
While a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model with a copy mechanism works better than existing code generation approaches on AnyC2C (see Section 5), it ignores the structural information available from the code’s AST.
For a versatile model of language, other aspects of language, viz.
 This work focus on the most challenging case, i.e, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), where no target label is available.
 Constant features are instead modeled within the transformation function f(xt, żt), which leads to a disentanglement of transformation and content.
First, it gives rise to inconsistent performances.
In the case of `0-norm attacks on neural networks, the adversary can perturb a bounded number of coordinates in the input vector but has no restriction on how much each coordinate is perturbed in absolute value.
A key component of clustering approaches is the choice of similarity metric for the considered data objects which we try to group (Irani et al., 2016).
 By aligning the student’s predictions to those of the teacher, the student can improve its performance.
 In another work (Zhang et al., 2019), though a bound on the gap between standard accuracy and adversarial accuracy is derived so that the gap between these two quantities could be explicitly controlled, the underlying reason of such trade-off is still not fully characterized.
 SLD also occurs in real applications; for example, an autonomous driving system should be able to handle changing frequencies of pedestrians and cars when adapting from a rural to a downtown area.
 This is very powerful when compared to classical MLNs, where either domain experts are required to design some useful statistics about the domain of interest by hand (i.g, logical rules) or structure learning based on combinatorial search needs to be performed.
 S is called strictly proper if it holds for any p and q that Ex∼PS(p, x) > Ex∼PS(q, x).
 DP-ERM minimizes the empirical risk while guaranteeing that the output of learning algorithm is differentially private with respect to the training data.
To provide uncertainty estimation, each prediction produced by the machine learning module during inference should be a distribution over the target domain.
As the number of contributions is growing fast, it becomes harder and harder to make a proper comparison between different algorithms.
 Fortunately, there is a wealth of observational data available in the medical domain from electronic health records (Henry et al., 2016).
 To maintain repeatability, authors are encouraged to publish their code, containers, and write documentation which details the usage along with HW/SW requirements (Mitchell et al., 2019; Reproducibility Checklist; Dodge et al., 2019; Lipton & Steinhardt, 2019; Pineau et al., 2018).
 Nevertheless, in many situations, more data with noisy labels are available or can be acquired for the end task.
 Due to its advantage of the simplicity of implementation, low memory requirement, and low computational complexity (Nemirovsky & Yudin, 1983; Beck & Teboulle, 2003; Lei & Tang, 2018), SMD is one of the most widely used methods in machine learning.
 Figure 1, produced using our proposed estimator, illustrates one such insight that is similar to the observations of Shwartz-Ziv & Tishby (2017), where training can be separated into two distinct phases, the fitting phase and the compression phase.
 We show that most existing neural-network personalization techniques, which satisfy the split-personalization constraint (1,2,3), can be used directly in FL, with only a small change to Federated Averaging (McMahan et al., 2016), the most common FL training algorithm.
 Alternatively, domain randomization, in which the visual and physical properties of the training domains are randomized at the start of each episode during training, has also been shown to lead to improved generalization and transfer to the real world with little or no real world data (Tobin et al., 2017; Sadeghi & Levine, 2016; Antonova et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2017; Mordatch et al., 2015; Rajeswaran et al., 2016; OpenAI, 2018).
 For example, given a C-class dataset S = {(x0i , yi)}ni=1 with x0i ∈ Rd as a normal or clean example in the d-dimensional input space and yi ∈ RC as its associated one-hot label, the objective of adversarial training is to solve the following min-max optimization problem:min θ1N N∑ i=1 max ‖zi−x0i‖≤ `(hθ(zi), yi) (1)where hθ : Rd → RC is the deep neural network (DNN) function, ` is the loss function and is the maximum perturbation constraint.
However, mismatches exist between the data sets utilized by most existing learning-based methods and the real images captured by a mobile phone.
 The saliency maps corresponding to adversarial images show perceptible differences to that of the original image, even though adversarial images themselves often seem unperturbed.
 Because they effectively combine the context information in different receptive field to ensure the highlevel semantic information and high resolution information fusion at the same time.
 Slight changes in learning rate, learning rate decay, momentum, and weight decay (amongst others) can drastically alter performance.
 Although the demand toward PC layer has been and will be growing exponentially in modern neural network architectures, there has been a little research on improving the naive structure of itself.
In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method to perform a training data subset search by using ensemble Active Learning (AL).
 We, in this paper, present a novel unsupervised representation learning approach that is applicable to more generic type of data and tasks.
 Kwok and Tsang (Kwok & Tsang, 2003) show that in a single-label prediction task, via pushing two origin nearby instances of different classes further apart with a large margin in RKHS, performance of kNN can be greatly improved.
In this work, we propose the Random Path GAN (RPGAN) — an alternative design of GANs that allows natural interpretability of the generator network.
Generative modelling, where generators are trained for sampling from given data distributions, is a popular application of OT.
 Deep learning methods (Li et al., (2018); Che et al., (2018); Cao et al., (2018); Luo et al., (2018a)) have been proposed to capture temporal relationship based on RNN (Cho et al., (2014b); Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997); Cho et al., (2014a)).
To deal with such problem, another major branch of RLfD takes advantage of the demonstrations in reward shaping, by either designing the demonstration-oriented potential-based reward shaping function (Brys et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2018), or inducing implicit dynamic reward shaping through learning a discriminator from demonstrations, which can distinguish between demonstrations and self-generated data (Zhu et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2018).
 FPN(Lin et al., (2017a)) augmented a top-down path with lateral connections for object detection.
 Moreover, even though we do not discuss a new activation quantization method in this paper, if activations are also quantized by using binary codes, then most computations are replaced with bit-wise operations (using XNOR logic and population counts) (Xu et al., 2018; Rastegari et al., 2016).
 Even so, these techniques cannot easily scale to large datasets, e.g, ImageNet.
 Several works showed that this method significantly improves the calibration of the probabilities (Guo et al., 2017; Neumann et al., 2018).
 Instances of RISE operate recursively on all intermediate time steps between two observed values, by imputing the first unobserved value in a row based on the preceding observed values and then working with the imputed value as though it were observed.
 However, they still require fairly strong assumptions on the reward function.
 The popular ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015) contains 100,000 testing images (100 per class) for testing various image classification models.
 In addition, the partition of the latent space into diagonal Gaussians leads to either mode-mixing issues or regions of poor sample quality (Kingma et al., 2016).
Our main findings are:
 If the dimension of the generated sample is higher than that of the raw data, the additional generated portion must follow the potential distribution of raw data points.
 Unfortunately, high-quality paired data are not always available across different text domains and styles.
 On the one hand, regularization techniques can work well in principle, but come with the caveat of relying on a new task’s proximity to previous knowledge.
 Conventionally, the mean representation is used as the encoded latent variables, an unnoticed high TCmean is usually the culprit behind the undesirable entanglement.
 Besides, generative approaches not only learn the required classification representations, but also capture the semantics-disentangled factors that generate the data, making it easier to generalize to different tasks (Narayanaswamy et al., 2017).
 We extend the uncertainty metric to Top k predictions.
 This is a hindrance for state-of-the-art deep learning models, where all parameters are updated after observing each example.
 However, it is ideal to achieve this in an unsupervised learning setting to take advantage of the large amount of available unlabeled data.
The more structured and informative the input representation is with respect to the task, the quicker the agent can be trained.
 Therefore, the segmentation along temporal axis and discarding uninformative signal waves are required.
 Unfortunately, because of the large number of constraints, using standard optimization techniques, researchers have been forced to restrict either the kinds of metrics learned or the size of the problem that can be solved.
 Along the way we also recover the state-of-the-art bounds for matrix completion.
 However, because running multiple runs of training simply to train this teacher network entails an n-fold increase in training time for n runs, this is infeasible in many practical settings.
 In addition to the sequential reading, our model is designed to collect pieces of information in parallel and to aggregate them in its last layer.
Semi-supervised Few-shot Learning (SS-FSL): Few-shot learning methods typically adopt a supervised learning setup (e.g, (Vinyals et al., 2016; Ravi & Larochelle, 2017b; Snell et al., 2017)), very recently, Ren et al., (2018) and Zhang et al., (2018) developed Semi-supervised few-shot learning approaches that can leverage additional unlabeled data.
 Among the three models, LASER is based on neural machine translation approach and strictly requires parallel data to train.
 We train agent policies to respond to synthetic, template-based language but also endow them with powerful language encoders that are pretrained on natural language text.
 Similarly, the common performance measures of DR such as trustworthinesscontinuity (Venna & Kaski, 2005), precision-recall (i.g, AUC) (Venna et al., 2010), and nearestneighbor accuracy have also been developed by retaining the same focus on reflecting the local accuracy of the embedding.
 Thus, for deep neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD), this could present a (partial) explanation for their generalization performance (Zhang et al., 2016), since minibatch SGD tends to converge to flat local minima (Zhang et al., 2018; Jastrzębski et al., 2017).
 This reduces the applicability of differential privacy to deep learning in practice, where strong performance tends to require a large number of model parameters.
 Note that this model involves no fake news.
This removes the need to manually collect data and allows for scalable data collection, resulting in massive datasets. For example, Mahajan et al. (2018) pre-trains using existing images and their corresponding hashtags from Instagram to obtain state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2014).
We present a qualitative study of how 3D CNNs and CLSTMs respectively compute video features: what do they learn, and how do they differ from one another?
Successfully detecting out-of-distribution examples is crucial in a safety critical environment.
 Newer long-read technologies can sequence complete genomes of viruses and small bacteria, but with a higher error rate (Jain et al., 2016).
 Recently other uncertainties such as dissonance, consonance, vagueness, and monosonance (Josang et al., 2018) are also introduced.
 On the other hand, neural semantic parsing models have a high recall, i.g,top-n predictions of the model cover the gold-standard meaning representation most of the time (c.f. Table 2 in Section 2).
 Ganin & Lempitsky (2014)), the goal is to adapt a model trained on a source domain (often using unlabeled data) so that its performance improves on a target domain that contains the same set of target classes but under a distribution shift.
 The zeroed-out d− k elements are stored as residual pt for the next iteration.
 While being commonly used, MPC has serveral drawbacks (Atkeson & Schaal, 1997; Thananjeyan et al., 2019).
 For examples when x→∞, 2x2 + 5x has a leading power of 2 (because the expression behaves like x2) and 1/x2 + 1/x has a leading power of −1.
 However, the attacker cannot get access to the gradients or model parameters under this setting; whereas in the white-box setting, the attacker is allowed to analytically compute the model’s gradients, and have full access to the model architecture and weights.
 The most widely used divergence measure is KL(q||p) where p is the target distribution and q is the approximate distribution.
A simple yet effective method to address the problem of the inability of neural networks to detect OOD examples is to train them so that they make highly uncertain predictions for examples generated by novel class distributions.
 In this regime, SGD seems to converge quickly with constant learning rates.
In this work, we investigate the role of noise injection in consistency training and observe that advanced data augmentation methods, specifically those work best in supervised learning (Simard et al., 1998; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Cubuk et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018), also perform well in semisupervised learning.
 Key to the ALI-G algorithm are the following two ideas.
 The scarcity of standard recognized benchmark datasets and evaluation frameworks is another.
To end the cycle between defenses and attacks, a line of work on certified defenses has gained attention where the goal is to train classifiers whose predictions are provably robust within some given region (Huang et al., 2016; Katz et al., 2017; Ehlers, 2017; Carlini et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2017; Lomuscio & Maganti, 2017; Dutta et al., 2018; Fischetti & Jo, 2018; Bunel et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018a; Wong & Kolter, 2017; Wang et al., 2018b; Wong et al., 2018; Raghunathan et al., 2018b;a; Dvijotham et al., 2018a;b; Croce et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2018; Gowal et al., 2018; Gehr et al., 2018; Mirman et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018b; Weng et al., 2018).
 Furthermore, with multiple tasks, one must take into account the impact of shared operations.
 Neither does it rely on a multitude of simulations across randomly generated source domains.
 Instead, variants of ensemble decision trees still dominate data science competitions with tabular data (Kaggle, 2019b).
In this work, we aim to address this limitation by extending the search space of NAS with feature self-calibration operations for scaling up the search boundary.
 Another, different, approach for address costly labeled data is that of active learning (AL).
Recent work has suggested that the expressive capacity of LSTMs resembles that of counter machines (Merrill, 2019; Suzgun et al., 2019; Weiss et al., 2018).
 Another limitation of the current GNN architectures is that they are mostly unable to do the hierarchical feature learning employed in the CNNs (He et al., 2016; Krizhevsky et al., 2012).
 Since it is unrealistic to augment the training data towards all possible manipulations that many occur, a principled method that fundamentally improves the robustness is much needed.
Contributions.
 We extend this approach to the constrained setting from a black-box density with compact support.
 Towards this goal, we investigate the challenging problem of predicting a turbulent flow, governed by the high-dimensional nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations.
 Knowing this upper bound allows to accelerate the convergence of an RMax algorithm (Brafman and Tennenholtz, 2002).
 Several techniques have been proposed in the literature based on hashing and quantization to solve the approximate maximum inner product search problem efficiently, and the quantization based techniques have shown strong performance (Ge et al., 2014; Babenko and Lempitsky, 2014; Johnson et al., 2017).
 The most commonly used noise in the literature is uniform (or symmetric) labelflipping noise, in which the label of each example is independently and uniformly changed to a random (incorrect) class with probability p.
 The common data structure for representing knowledge graphs is a set of triples relation(head, tail) that represent information as a collection of binary relations.
 Furthermore, existing defences are vulnerable to new, stronger attacks: Carlini & Wagner (2017a) and Athalye et al., (2018) advocate designing specialized attacks to circumvent prior defences, while Uesato et al., (2018) warn against using weak attacks to evaluate robustness.
The gradient is another fundamental element in deep networks that is utilized to learn new information from given inputs by updating model weights (Goodfellow et al., 2016).
 For example, node embeddings trained on a Flickr user graph were shown to predict user-specified Flickr “interests" (24).
 Besides, these methods are heavily data-driven, limiting the diversity of generated questions and requiring large training sets for different goals and contexts.
 For example, in the formalized writing task, the rewritten span should align well with the surrounding context (e.g, personal email, scientific content) to keep a coherent text flow.
 We hypothesize that in such scenarios, coordination-promoting inductive biases on the policy search could help discover coordinated behaviors more efficiently and supersede task-specific reward shaping and curriculum learning.
 This observation is typically described as a trade-off between robustness and accuracy (Tsipras et al., 2018; Stutz et al., 2019; Raghunathan et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019).
 The recent progress on verification spans from the exact verification method (Katz et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2017; Carlini et al., 2017) to the approximate (relaxed) verification method (Kolter & Wong, 2018; Raghunathan et al., 2018; Weng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Boopathy et al., 2019; Dvijotham et al., 2018b; Wong et al., 2018).
 Attributed network embedding methods (Yang et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2017; Liao et al., 2018) leverage this additional information to supplement that of node neighbourhood structure, benefiting many applications, e.g, recommender systems, node classification and link prediction (Yang et al., 2018; Yang & Yang, 2018; Zhang et al., 2018).
 At token-level, KD approaches minimize DKL(q(yt|y<t,x)‖p(yt|y<t,x)) where q(yt|y<t,x) teacher or p(yt|y<t,x) student is a probability distribution over tokens in the vocabulary conditioned on previous tokens y<t and the source sentence x.
 Hendrycks and Gimpel (2017) and others (Nguyen et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2011) showed that looking at the maximal softmax value is insufficient.
One straightforward way is to build a translation system by using a graph encoder-decoder architecture.
 We address the challenges of building the tree and running simulations by adopting a hybrid method, in which we first train a policy using existing model-free RL methods, and then use the pre-trained policy distribution to draw actions with which to build the tree.
 Given a set of region proposals, these methods perform object classification and bounding box regression on each proposal individually, without taking the semantic context into consideration.
 However, they still rely on autoregressive or recurrent components to predict the frame-level acoustic features (e.g, 100 frames per second), which can be slow at synthesis on modern hardware optimized for parallel execution.
 (2) One task is not able to exploit useful information from the other (e.g, the type of relation identified by the RE system may be useful to the NER system for determining the type of entities involved in the relation, and vice versa).
 It is also crucial to demystify why CNNs make certain decisions.
 This idea of progressive learning is actually a general manner of cognition process (Elman, 1993; Oudeyer et al., 2007), which has been formally named curriculum learning in machine learning (Bengio et al., 2009).
 A similar strategy has also been explored in Sabour et al., (2017); Qin et al., (2019) for Capsule networks, and exploiting semi-supervised (unlabeled) data in Lasserre et al., (2006); Grabner et al., (2007); Larochelle & Bengio (2008); Le et al., (2018).
 Thus, the verification feedback can be directly used to improve the model.
The work described in this paper continues in the direction of inference optimization by pruning.
 Therefore, substitute attacks are proposed to attack models without the gradient information.
 BERT cannot be finetuned for such tasks with long text directly or perform good on these tasks, since it is limited by the fixed-length position embedding which was determined during pretraining.
 Hence, directly solving high-level CV tasks with these C-JPG images will lead to poor performance.
 Variational autoencoders (Kingma & Welling, 2014) provide functionality for both (approximate) inference and sampling.
 These approaches were first explored by Liu et al., (2017) using LSTM models; the current state-of-the-art performance on this task uses Transformer models (Lin et al., 2019; Karpov et al., 2019).
 In this way, we train neural networks to perform relatively simple tasks in a supervised manner, and obtain complex behaviors through composition.
 Agents do not know which latent MDP they are interacting with, preventing them from acting optimally with respect to that MDP.
The generator tries to minimize the number of these off-manifold points, and thus they are generally just a small fraction of the total generated distribution.
 This type of methods do not rely on expert knowledge, can be easily generalized to various combinatorial optimization problems, thus become promising research direction at the intersection of ML and OR.
 If the batch data is not sufficient to cover the state-action space, BRL models can suffer from extrapolation error, learning unrealistic value estimates of state-action pairs not contained in the batch (Fujimoto et al., 2018b).
 Representing uncertainty is important for many reasons, including robust classification and decision making, informing downstream models, interpreting representations, and detecting out-of-distribution samples.
 However, it is a well-known challenge to define the reward function under the real-world scenarios(Abbeel & Ng, 2004).
For the largest LMs, the input size can reach up to four thousand tokens; however, this is still a limitation as they cannot process arbitrarily long documents.
 On-chip training has also been demonstrated for handling hardware imperfections (Zhang et al., 2017; Gonugondla et al., 2018).
Level Set methods (Zhao et al., 1996; Brox et al., 2006) and Active Shapes (Paragios & Deriche, 2000; Chan & Vese, 2001) have been proposed to incorporate shape and image priors to mitigate boundary ambiguities (Tsai et al., 2003; Rousson & Paragios, 2002).
 Therefore, many unsupervised learning approaches have been proposed to take advantage of large amounts of unlabeled data that are more readily available.
Extending this line of research, we propose a novel and simple feature scoring metric, NormLIME, which estimates the importance of features based on local model explanations.
 Accordingly, previous successes have used GNN (Graph Neural Networks) and message-passing based embeddings to solve SAT problems.
Two lines of work, curriculum learning and label smoothing, offer alternative strategies to improve learning in deep networks.
 Implicit generative models such as GANs which optimize a generator and a discriminator in a min-max fashion have recently become popular for their ability to synthesize realistic data (Karras et al., 2018; Engel et al., 2019).
Most previous works of MBRL adopt supervised learning with `2-based errors (Luo et al., 2019; Kurutach et al., 2018; Clavera et al., 2018) or maximum likelihood (Janner et al., 2019), to obtain an environment model that synthesizes real transitions.
The remarkable performance achieved by such models largely comes from their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequences.
In sport there exists strong, complex group-structure which is less prevalent in other multi-agent systems such as pedestrian tracking.
 The ability to prune networks with seemingly so little degradation to accuracy is puzzling.
Many different strategies are proposed for automatically discovering the task hierarchy or learning the temporal abstraction.
 However, no theory exists for how to choose pivoting rules based on the LP instance distributions encountered in practice, let alone how to design new pivot rules based on properties of the instance family.
 However these methods focused on learning a state-space model that doesn’t capture the compositional nature of observations: the visual scene is represented by a single latent vector and thus cannot be expected to generalize well to different objects layouts.
 Currently GANs are considered as the state-of-the-art for generative modeling tasks, producing high-quality images but are more difficult to train due to unstable training dynamics, unless more sophisticated variants are applied.
Assuming there is an expert policy πE that is optimal for an unknown reward function, here we refer to a feature as task-irrelevant if it does not affect that reward.
 On contrast, the explicit or hand-crafted rules can be interpreted as policies by neural networks to make decisions, which are insensitive to problem settings.
 Therefore, it is meaningful to recognize unseen attribute-object pairs based on seen pairs.
 In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by giving a comprehensive explanation which justifies both kinds of observations.
 For this optimization problem, Madry et al., (2017) propose to train a robust model with the augmented data generated by the projected gradient descent method (PGD).
 Inference methods (Raykar et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2012; 2014) have been applied to perform smarter aggregation that aims to outperform majority-voted answers.
 One can only query the function value (i.g,, obtaining f(w)) by training a model with the hyper-parameter values indicated by w.
 However, the original method only works on this specific architecture configuration and needs retraining for visualizing other applications.
 This analogy is comprehensible since every molecule has a unique text representation named SMILES (Weininger, 1988).
For ease of exposition, we phrase the problem we consider in the classical survival analysis context of predicting time until death.
 A landmark localized to a smaller, rigid area of the object will offer more precise pose information in the event of object motion.
 However,BNNs require significant modifications to the training procedure, and exact Bayesian inference is computationally prohibitive in practice.
 It contains nodes and message functions with partial information, the final output of model relies on a sequence of communication operations which transforms the nodes information dynamically over iterations.
 A commonly adopted strategy is to first locate similar sequences from the original passage using a pre-defined threshold (using metrics like ROUGE-L) and then treat them as positive training examples.
 Mitzenmacher (2002) proposed Compressed Bloom filter to address the suboptimal space usage of BF, where the space usage can reach the theoretical lower bound in the optimal case.
DPSGD, for a given minibatch, first computes the per-observation gradient, g(xi), and then clips g(xi) in l2 norm, g(xi)/max(1,||g(xi)||2/C) (Line 6 in Abadi et al., (2016), Algorithm 1).
 This limits the network’s depth and restricts the receptive field of the vertices in the graph to a few-hop neighborhood, which is insufficient to properly capture local structures, relationships between nodes, and subgraph importance in sparse graphs such as molecules.
 Most state-of-the-art solutions are trying to find a new objective or add some new regularization terms to the cost function, which mainly affect the generator (Arjovsky et al., 2017; Arjovsky & Bottou, 2017; Mao et al., 2017; Nowozin et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2018).
 In this paper we consider the problem of generating semantic adversarial examples (SAEs) (Hosseini & Poovendran, 2018; Joshi et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2019; Dreossi et al., 2018b).
 In this setting, the sample complexity of simple exploration strategies was shown to grow exponentially with state dimension in some cases (Osband et al., 2016b).
 A natural diagnostic question, with which we begin our work, is whether the long-term generations of these models exhibit the same entropy rates as the underlying languages they are modeling predictively.
 Other works adopt the same idea and extend to specific tasks such as video-based person re-identification (Li et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018) and action recognition (Wang et al., 2018c) by learning spatial-temporal attentions.
The conventional black-box methods employed unnatural and fragile perturbation schemes such as single colour out (Seo et al., 2018; Petsiuk et al., 2018; Ribeiro et al., 2016; Zeiler & Fergus, 2013), random noise (Tian & Cai, 2017; Zintgraf et al., 2017; Fong & Vedaldi, 2017) and smoothing (Fong & Vedaldi, 2017).
 In this example, an action in the current round will not affect the rewards in future rounds, and not all rewards received in future states do contribute to the advantage function of the current action.
As pointed out in (Morcos et al., 2018), a CNN that generalizes well would have its channels contributed equally in its feed-forward computations.
 We are interested in the class of SSM which has both discrete and continuous latent variables, which we denote by st and zt, where t is the discrete time index.
 Our main goal is to provide an alternative that does not require the specification of the noise rates, nor an additional estimation step for the noises.
 There are several reasons for choosing WDs:
 However, clusters identified from these approaches these approaches are purely unsupervised – they do not account for each patient’s observed outcome (e.g, adverse events, the onset of comorbidities, etc.) – which leads to heterogeneous clusters if the clinical presentation of the disease differs even for similar patients.
 Thus, there has been considerable interest towards research in reducing the memory footprint and faster inference speed for these models (Sainath et al., 2013; Acharya et al., 2019; Shu & Nakayama, 2017; Shi & Yu, 2018; Jegou et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2018; Winata et al., 2018).
 Furthermore, larger models in off-chip memory become dominant energy cost (Han et al., 2015a), complicating on-line training on battery-power devices.
Methods aimed at large-scale training have been proposed and can be roughly divided into two categories: (1) sampling-based methods and (2) clustering-based methods.
 This change largely mitigates the rapid decay of learning rate in Adagrad and hence makes this family of algorithms, especially Adam, particularly popular on various tasks.
 On the other side, a limit form of Euler’s constant indicates that τ = 1/Ω(L) is sufficient for the forward stability as shown in previous work (Allen-Zhu et al., 2019; Du et al., 2019).
 With the availability of large annotated video datasets such as ILSVRC 2015 Object Detection from Video Challenge (Russakovsky et al., 2015) and YouTube-Bounding Boxes (Real et al., 2017), it has become popular to learn features directly by optimizing tracking objectives.
 Each architecture inherits its weights from the supernet.
 However, instead of directly pointing out why the target class is derived based on input, it is likely to answer the question (Montavon et al., 2018): What makes this instance more or less similar to the target class? To tackle this limitation, perturbation-based explanation methods are proposed.
 LSTMs serve as a fine-grained component, but are wrapped within a larger multigrid connection topology, from which novel capabilities emerge.
 Then to reconstruct the HR patch, the sparse representation of LR patch can be applied to the HR dictionary with the assumption that LR/HR patch pair shares similar sparse representation.
 Tanay & Griffin (2016) provide the perspective that adversarial examples exist because the class boundary extends beyond the data sub-manifold and can be lying close to it in some cases.
 Given data set D, model M(·, λ) and loss function L(·, ·), it aims to find an optimal parameter vector w to minimize L(M(w;λ),D).
 These packages include significant amounts of code duplication and hand written gradients.
 Intriguingly, recent research (Arjovsky et al., 2017; Dai & Wipf, 2019) suggests that the discrepancy between the intrinsic and ambient dimensionalities of data also contributes to the difficulties in training GANs and VAEs.
 For example, to run a model on chips with strict memory limitations, 1 bit or 2 bits’ quantization suffers from severe accuracy loss (Rastegari et al., (2016)) while 16 bits’ or 8 bits’ quantization cannot significantly reduce the model size.
In this work, we explore a new approach to defend various attacks by developing a generative cleaning network with quantized nonlinear transform.
 Instead of showing which class of function a GCN or GNN model can theoretically learn, we develop quantitative bounds for the gaps between GCN/SGC and a two-layers fully connected neural network.
 More concretely, the gating functions of our model are now parameterized repeatedly by instances of itself which imbues our model with the ability to reason deeply1 and recursively about certain inputs.
 For such signals, it is of interest to provide guarantees with respect to temporal specifications (e.g, absence of repetitions in a generated sequence, or that a generated sequence halts appropriately).
 However, both IS and FID were introduced in the context of unconditional image generation and, hence, focus on capturing certain desirable properties such as visual quality and sample diversity, which do not fully encapsulate all the different phenomena that arise during conditional image generation.
 Structured pruning methods (Li et al., 2016; Anwar et al., 2017; Lemaire et al., 2018) prune the entire filters and feature maps.
 These seemingly diverse problem statements share a common thread: the presence of a partially known physical prior that can be blended with a neural network.
Modelling spectrograms can simplify the task of capturing global structure, but can weaken a model’s ability to capture local characteristics that correlate with audio fidelity.
 We study the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain waves of the human-in-the-loop to generate the reward functions that can be used by the DRL algorithms.
 Cai et al., (2017) and Gao et al., (2018) are two major works that study active learning for GNN.
 Even if the overall fairness goal is a potentially harmful, zero-gap classifier, pursuing first a Pareto-fair classifier and later applying other harmful methodologies ensures that all possible non-harmful trade-offs are covered before explicitly degrading performance, therefore minimal harm is introduced to the decision.
 In this case, one branch of the literature, dating back to the pioneering work of Bucila et al., (2006), recommends generating synthetic data for compression and proposes tailored generation schemes for tabular (Bucila et al., 2006) and image (Urban et al., 2017) data.
 Several discriminative models corresponding to the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) have been proposed (Axelrod et al., 2006; Bahl et al., 1996; Klautau et al., 2003; Tsai & Chang, 2002; Tsuji et al., 1999; Tüske et al., 2015; Wang, 2007).
 The observations in some locations/time-steps differ substantially from the observations in their neighboring locations/time-steps.
 Similar phenomenons are also observed in the sales of different products in E-commerce.
 Conditioning on a class label or embedding allows, for instance in the case of face images, to generate a range of different images of a given person identity varying in pose, lighting, expression, etc., by conditioning on the latent embedding learned by a face recognition network (e.g, Van den Oord et al., 2016).
 In both cases, however, the dimensionality of the factor vector space is fixed and defined prior to training.
 Rather, inliers are distributed in a complex, unknown fashion potentially with multiple clusters of inliers in the feature space (6).
 There have been several attempts to propose such metrics.
 Displaying attended region might be used for indirect reasoning.
 The high-level idea of these works is that during training, we predict the strongest perturbation to each sample against the current model and use the perturbed sample together with the correct label for gradient descent optimization.
In this work, we introduce a new retrospection loss that utilizes prior training experiences of a deep neural network to guide parameter updates and improve performance.
 Having such policies would empower many downstream tasks, including behavior discovery (Eyjolfsdottir et al., 2014), realistic simulations (Le et al., 2017), virtual agent design (Broll et al., 2019), and counterfactual behavioral reasoning (Zhan et al., 2019).
 A variety of loss functions have been proposed such as contrastive loss (Hadsell et al., (2006)), binomial deviance loss (Yi et al.,), margin loss (Wu et al., (2017)), lifted-structure (LS) loss (Oh Song et al., (2016)), N-pair loss (Sohn (2016)), triplet loss (Schroff et al., (2015)), multi-similarity (MS) loss (Wang et al., (2019).
Data imputation with deep generative models has been an active research area (Yoon et al., 2018; Ivanov et al., 2019; Nazabal et al., 2018).
 To prevent accuracy degradation, many approaches have employed training the model with quantization constraints or modifying the network structure.
 Therefore, they cannot easily capture higher-order temporal correlations needed for long-term prediction.
 However, these training mechanisms add regularization and computational overhead to eliminate unnecessary weights.
 Furthermore, dilated convolutions can be used to aggregate information and provide context over a larger receptive fields without increasing the number of parameters (Yu & Koltun, 2016).
 Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks can learn more transferable features for domain adaptation (Glorot et al., 2011; Yosinski et al., 2014).
 Recently, Freeman & Bruna (2016) proved this for rectified networks with one hidden layer.
 However, the methods for invariant data achieve better accuracy, thus it contradicts the theoretical principle.
The prior work on unsupervised feature selection is diverse, with methods designed to provide good clustering results (Cai et al., 2010; Dy & Brodley, 2004) to preserve the local structure of data (He et al., 2006; Zhao & Liu, 2007; Cai et al., 2010), and to eliminate redundancy (Farahat et al., 2011; Mitra et al., 2002).
 But these works did not provide theoretical explanation for this behavior of α or practical guide to set this parameter.
 Later on, Huang et al., (2017) applied RealNVP (Dinh et al., 2017) to learn the prior.
Despite the increased interest in invertible neural networks, little attention has been paid to guarantees on their numerical invertibility.
 A stronger type of attack, such as the `∞ attacks, is much more challenging to defense and verify due to the larger set of perturbations, but is more relevant in practice.
 Recent works can handle very complex learning algorithms such as neural networks (Beutel et al., 2017; Wadsworth et al., 2018; Madras et al., 2018; Manisha & Gujar, 2018).
Our framework consists of two phases.
 Unfortunately, exact Bayesian inference is intractable in general for neural networks.
 A recent approach, graph attention networks (GAT), employs the attention mechanism so that weights used for neighborhood aggregation differ according to the feature of nodes (Veličković et al., 2018).
 In this domain, Baehrens et al., (2010) use a Parzen window classifier to approximate the target classifier locally.
Although it is known that adversarial examples are widely existent (Su et al., 2018), some fundamental questions are still far from being well studied like what causes it, and how the factor impacts the performance, etc.
 The activations are a representation of (possibly unseen) future inputs (test set), ideally sufficient to predict future outputs, and invariant to nuisance variability in the data that should not affect the output.
 To handle delusion, the authors propose a policy-consistent backup operator that maintains multiple Q-value estimates organized into information sets.
 These methods explore easily accessible information, such as temporal or spatial neighbourhood, to design a surrogate supervisory signal to empower the feature learning.
 Together with the rise of Electronic Health Records (EHR), the scientific community is now armed with both the data and labelling techniques to experiment with novel prediction methods (Islam et al., 2019; Henry et al., 2015; Ghosh et al., 2017; Calvert et al., 2016; Desautels et al., 2016), which are already proving effective in increasing survival rate (Shimabukuro et al., 2017) and promising in decreasing costs.
 For instance, Cheng et al., (2018); Chen et al., (2019a) have applied decision-based attacks for evaluating robustness of Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) and random forest.
 Among those works, the representative methods are MentorNet (Jiang et al., 2018) and Co-teaching (Han et al., 2018b; Yu et al., 2019), they take small-loss samples in each mini-batch as clean instances.
 Previous studies consider the problem as a post-classification task.
Given the sequential nature of RL, it is not necessary to attack at every time step to degrade the agent’s performance significantly (Lin et al., 2017; Kos & Song, 2017).
 To obtain more stable models, the generative moment matching networks (GMMNs) Li et al., (2015) are proposed, wherein instead of training a discriminator network, a non-parametric statistical hypothesis test is performed to accept or reject the generated samples via the computation of the kernel maximum mean discrepancy Gretton et al., (2007).
Goal-independent Decision States.
 They empirically try to show that, for effective OOD detection, the generated OOD samples should follow and be close to the low-density boundaries of in-distribution, and the proposed GAN training indeed tries to do that.
 While successful in multiple problem domains, this approach makes it difficult to accommodate the second feature of human learning: imitation across shifts in embodiment and dynamics.
 In order to benefit from n-step data, the replay buffer has to be restricted in size or n has to be set to a small value to keep the samples close to the target-policy (Barth-Maron et al., 2018; Hessel et al., 2018).
 Furthermore, using an existing time series from interaction to craft a meta-dataset may require a difficult or expensive process of detecting switches in task.
 In particular, we focus on those challenging environments with sparse external rewards, where exploration is commonly driven by some sort of intrinsic reward.
 For instance, networks exhibit excessive invariance to visual features (Jacobsen et al., 2018), texture bias (Geirhos et al., 2018a), sensitivity to worst-case (adversarial) perturbations (Goodfellow et al., 2014), and a propensity to rely on non-robust, but highly predictive features for classification (Doersch et al., 2015; Ilyas et al., 2019).
In this paper, we first seek to understand the primary contribution of the entropy term to the performance of maximum entropy algorithms.
 In particular, we want to know if “good” tickets can be obtained when few data samples, or few labels, or even no labels, are available.
 In general, the role of g(·) is a regularizer to f(·) or a generator to produce more data.
 Applying the STFT on the raw signal, on the other hand, is computationally efficient, as in practice it is implemented with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) whose computational complexity is O(n log(n)).
 Their training process aims to achieve a Nash Equilibrium between these two sub-models.
 To further investigate the effectiveness of MRM, we propose three MRM variants: (i) Masked Region Classification (MRC); (ii) Masked Region Feature Regression (MRFR); and (iii) Masked Region Classification with KL-divergence (MRC-kl).
However, Problem (1) is in general NP hard, which is caused by the non-convexity of the sparsity constraint.
 We investigate on various objectives and environment conditions, and find that the quality of visual representation learning correlates well with progress in reward optimization.
 Using an adaptive step size strategy instead of a constant step size can often increase efficiency by several orders of magnitude, c.f. (Söderlind, 2006).
 The basic FL algorithm, Federated Averaging (FedAvg) (McMahan et al., 2017), has been used in production applications, for instance for next word prediction in mobile keyboard (Hard et al., 2018), which shows that Federated Learning can outperform the best model trained in a datacenter.
 These studies provide the first steps to understand the role of over-parameterization of neural networks and the gradient descent on regression problems using the squared loss function.
 As stated by Daskalakis & Panageas (2018), our knowledge of min-max optimization in non convex-concave settings is “very limited.” Therefore, existing results often only analyze local stability or local convergence (Daskalakis et al., 2017; Daskalakis & Panageas, 2018; Azizian et al., 2019; Gidel et al., 2018; Mazumdar et al., 2019; Yazıcı et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2019; Sanjabi et al., 2018).
 In iterated elimination of dominated strategy we iteratively examine the actions of every agent, and remove strictly dominated actions, until no further actions can be removed.
 During encoding, NL-input symbolic structures are encoded as vector space embeddings using TPR ‘binding’ (following Palangi et al., (2018)); during decoding, symbolic constituents are extracted from structure-embedding output vectors using TPR ‘unbinding’ (following Huang et al., (2018; 2019)).
 Reducing this distributional difference may be a practicable way to improve text generation.
 Recognizing diverse even unseen predicates is significant for providing very rich relationship information, describing the complex scenes, and analogizing the known abstract concepts to the novel ones.
 In Palmer et al., (2015), spiking responses of neurons in salamander retina had near optimal mutual information with the future states of sequential stimuli they were exposed to, while compressing the past as much as possible.
Here we explore—to our best knowledge for the first time in depth—the simultaneous generation of chemical compounds and geometries.
 Under a wide range of conditions, the probability p(x) of a conformation x, is governed by the Boltzmann distribution and is proportional to exp{−E(x)/kBT}, where E(x) ∈ R is the conformation’s energy, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.
 These two issues are usually independently addressed by developing models handling only the missing data or the domain adaptation problem.
One notable type of task-agnostic (or meta) knowledge comes from the shared mechanism of data augmentation or hallucination across categories (Wang et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2018; Schwartz et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018a).
 Conditional generative models are powerful and natural choices to model the class conditional distributions, but they suffer from two big problems: (1) it is hard to scale generative classifiers on high-dimensional tasks, like natural images classification, with comparable performance to the discriminative counterparts.
 However, such a direction can be criticized, for its quality and applicability are bounded by those of existing solvers.
 For example, it is possible that it is only trained to differentiate between cats and dogs, but is tested on differentiating different breeds of dogs.
 On the other hand, the latter are largely location-invariant, while recent literature suggests spatial correlations should be revisited over time, to suit series prediction tasks (Shi et al., 2017).
 We need a mechanism that allows us to control the resulting policy to achieve new tasks at test-time.
 Although VAE, by its training robustness and general good generative performance is the most popular model for representation learning, in particular cases it suffers from the uninformative representation issue: the representation is entangled and the generative model tends to be independent of z, i.g,pθ(x|z) ≈ pθ(x).
 On the surface, it seems like we have only added information about the label distribution, so why does the test error increase?In this work, we theoretically study minimum norm interpolation in well-specified linear regression, and show that data augmentation with label-preserving perturbations can increase the test error in some regimes, even when the targets are noiseless.
 Evolutionary agents can efficiently leverage a single good model by generating similar models via a mutation process.
 Tan et al., (2019) proposed a NAS method to accelerate the inference speed on smartphones by incorporating resource-related constraints into the objective function.
On the other hand, a field of research named manifold alignment (Ham et al., 2003) has its primary concern in learning the correlations between the manifolds.
 One consequence is that benchmarks with consistent class semantics have similar class semantics between meta-training and meta-evaluation1.
 However, CVAEs assume a standard Gaussian prior on the latent variables which induces a strong model bias (Hoffman & Johnson, 2016; Tomczak & Welling, 2018) which makes it challenging to capture multi-modal distributions.
 In addition, besides identifying relevant features, we also identify the relevant time instances for those specific features, i.g,, we identify the most relevant observations.
 (This message has been also corroborated by several recent works (Brendel & Bethge, 2019; Geirhos et al., 2019; Jetley et al., 2018; Zhang & Zhu, 2019).) In fact, we show a more direct example of such a shortcoming (c.f. Section 2), wherein one can construct pairs of images that appear completely different to a human but are nearly identical in terms of their learned feature representations.
 Latest algorithms on efficient NAS fall into two categories: one-shot approaches (Bender et al., (2018)) and gradient-based approaches (Liu et al., (2018b)).
 Therefore, imitating diverse trajectories wouldbe more desirable to help encourage exploration in diverse directions and avoid being distracted by the misleading rewards.
 Such relationships can be modelled naturally and flexibly by hypergraphs.
 Interestingly, recent theoretical work (Achille & Soatto, 2018) has shown that invariance to “nuisance factors” should naturally emerge from the optimization process of deep models that minimize the information of the representations about the inputs, while retaining the minimum information about the target, as proposed by Tishby & Zaslavsky (2015) in the information bottleneck principle.
 However, agents trained by conventional DRL methods mentioned above can only learn one separate policy per task, failing to generalize to new tasks without additional large amount of training data.
 This is both due to the fact that conditioning on high-dimensional data such as images would require modeling and generating images in order to plan over several timesteps (Finn & Levine, 2017), and to the fact that modeling images is challenging and may unnecessarily focus on visual details which are not relevant for acting.
Despite the elegance of its mathematical formulation and the computational efficiency in solving the dual problem, the GEM model has following drawbacks for practical use.
 The current paper shows how to incorporate simple data augmentation.
There have been two kinds of ways to solve the objective-constrained task.
Training using DP-SGD is eminently practical and in addition to privacy offers advantages such as strong generalization and the promise of reusable holdouts (Google, 2019; Dwork et al., 2015).
 The computational flow of meProp is shown in Figure 1a and 1b.
 The raw quantized data require dlog2(L)e bits per value for storage.
 The organizations can share the generated data with high model compatibility to the public and enjoy the solution derived from it without leaking the real dataset.
 However, these models suffer from the problem that even small differences between the learned policy and the expert behavior can lead to a snow-balling effect, where the state distribution diverges to a place where the behavior of the policy is now meaningless since it was not trained in that part of space (Ross & Bagnell, 2010).
 Therefore, theabsence of large values can cause the accuracy degradation.
 All these approaches assume that the test data is from the same distribution as the training dataset.
 To address this, ANP (Kim et al., 2019) and the method in Rosenbaum et al., (2018) augment attention to NP and GQN (Eslami et al., 2018), respectively.
 This typically holds in classification tasks, where most successes of consistency regularization have been reported so far.
 In practice, MSGD can achieve better performance than SGD (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Sutskever et al., 2013).
 Its dimension can nevertheless be estimated to be around D \\u2248 14 based on the neighbourhoods of inputs in the data set (Grassberger & Procaccia, 1983; Costa & Hero, 2004; Levina & Bickel, 2004; Facco et al., 2017; Spigler et al., 2019).
 The curvature dominated regime may also arise if the epoch budget is small or the loss is poorly conditioned (McCandlish et al., 2018).
 Most importantly for this work, limitations arise when we seek to encode finite length messages (Kostina & Verdú, 2013).
 This is achieved by augmenting the standard GAN loss with a penalty term that discourages the model from producing infeasible structures.
 VAEs enable sampling by constraining the latent space to a unit Gaussian and sampling through the latent space.
 However, recent works have shown that this likelihood-based approach does not work in general, as deep generative models sometimes assign higher probability to OoD data than to in-distribution data (Nalisnick et al., 2018; Choi & Jang, 2018).
 For example, in a social network, we can solve search queries like “groups of people who like X and visited Y-city/state.” In a knowledge graph, we can answer questions like “how many languages are there in Africa speaking by people living near the banks of the Nile River?” Many pattern mining algorithms or graph database indexing based approaches have been proposed to tackle subgraph isomorphism problems (Ullmann, 1976; Cordella et al., 2004; He & Singh, 2008; Han et al., 2013; Carletti et al., 2018).
 Therefore, there is a burgeoning interest in adversarial attacks that are unrestricted, in the sense that they do not necessarily derive from a perturbation of a natural input (Brown et al., 2018; Song et al., 2018b).
 Wrapper methods (Kohavi & John, 1997b; Stein et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2007; Reunanen, 2003; Allen, 2013) use the outcome of a classifier to determine the relevance of each feature, which requires recomputing the classifier for each subset of features.
 3) Domain knowledge: The user should be able to easily integrate domain knowledge about object relationships.
In this paper, in order to bridge the gap between the empirical success of neural Q-learning and the theory of conventional Q-learning (i.g,, tabular Q-learning, and Q-learning with linear function approximation), we study the non-asymptotic convergence of a neural Q-learning algorithm under non-i.i.d. observations.
 (2)The MAP solution is computationally efficient, but only gives a point estimate and not a distribution over parameters.
 In other words, valuable information that could greatly aid control tasks is not taken advantage of in these schemes.
 The simplest option is an autoencoder with a pixel reconstruction objective.
 This is increasingly infeasible as the datasets are becoming quite large and might not be publicly released due to privacy or copyright reasons.
Server executes: initialize w0 for each round t = 1, 2, · · · , T dofor each learner k ∈ K in parallel do wtk ← LearnerUpdate(k,wt−1) end for wt ← ∑ k∈K |Pk|∑ j∈K|Pj |wtk end forLearnerUpdate(k,w): // Run on learner k B ←(split Pk into batches of size B) for each local epoch ε from 1 to E dofor each batch b ∈ B do w← w − η∇`(w;b)end for end for return w to serverContributions.
 The main contributions of this work are as follows.
 In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised text generation technique, called CaptainGAN, which propagates a modified gradient signal from discriminator to generator in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the estimator.
 Such work examines a specific model of the all-pay auction given as a normal-form game and analytically solves for the Nash equilibrium of the bidding strategy, expressed as a probability distribution over the possible bids.
Task 1 detects and classifies each object and roughly determines its region through an undersegmentation mask.
 Additionaly, Y refers to the label matrix where yij = 1 if jth label is relevant to ith instance, and 0 otherwise.
 When using existing decoders, this requires painstaking word-by-word copying of the input.
 Meanwhile, both Balduzzi et al., (2017) and Yang et al., (2019) argued that the combination of batch normalization and skip connections preserves the correlation between the gradients of different training examples at initialization, and they speculated that this enables the efficient training of deep architectures.
Since all these methods make strong assumptions on the distributions, a need arises for more generic solutions and non parametric algorithms, such as direct density estimation methods.
 (Howard & Ruder, 2018) is another example of such a success.
 Depending on the location of the unknown objects, a planner would then proceed with caution or hand over control to a safety driver.
 In Internet of Things (IoT) systems, it may represent a hardware failure or alarming event captured by sensors.
 This reward function, combined with goal proposing learning frameworks, maximizes the entropy of the history states.
 That study assumed that two consecutive signals are close in the `2-norm sense, formally, R(ht,ht−1) = 1 2‖Dht − FDht−1‖ 2 2, where F ∈ Rn0×n0 is a correlation matrix between st and st−1.
Free-form filters, directly defined by the parameters, are general and able to cope with unknown variations, but are parameter inefficient.
 While both are well recognized in deep learning in general, we argue that their value has been unexplored or underestimated in the context of deep active learning.
 That is to evaluate our models on multiple datasets with a holistic metric (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018).
 The original scheme may not be suitable for the current situation.
 However, in this research work we only focus to advance the Voice Conversion.
 Although Maddison et al., (2019) gives some hints to precondition DPGD, there is currently no analytical way for finding a suitable preconditioner.
 Like traditional embeddings, we train a function f that maps each example x ∈ Rn into an embedding space Rm so that examples with the same classes are mapped close together and examples with different classes are mapped far apart.
 This is because all examples of the training set are obtained from the seen classes, so thedata to be predicted as one of the unseen classes also has a strong relationship with the seen class attributes, resulting most of them assigned to one of the seen classes.
 This has influenced application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) such as Google’s tensor processing unit (TPU), which supports 16-bit floating point (16-FP) and soft processors such as Microsoft’s Project Brainwave which utilizes 8-FP.
In this work, we propose a novel on-disk format called Progressive Compressed Records (PCRs) as a way to reduce the bandwidth cost associated with training over massive datasets.
 Recent studies by Arora et al., (2019); Gunasekar et al., (2017), suggest that overparametrizing X as a product of several matrices results in a low rank matrix due to an implicit regularization induced by the gradient descent trajectories.
 Moreover, de-noising networks trained on a certain noise type do not perform well if the a different noise structure is experienced during inference (Zhussip & Chun (2018)).
 We show how to train these automata efficiently by approximating them with string automata whose weights form complex, diagonal matrices.
 Following a similar line of thought, Uguroglu & Carbonell (2011) devised a distribution measurement to select only features that do not vary from one domain to another.
 Instead, an approach where the sharing pattern is learned and adapted to the task relatedness, is preferable.
 Perceiving such local motions can be crucial for inferring ego-motion, object motions, and 3D depth information.
 Many of these machine learning methods have also been applied to stroke-based rendering tasks, including modeling the brush (Xie et al., (2012); Zheng et al., (2019)), generating brushstroke paintings in an artist’s style (Xie et al., (2015)), reconstructing drawings for specific paintings styles (Tang et al., (2018)), and constructing stroke-based drawings (Ha & Eck (2017a); Zhou et al., (2018); Huang et al., (2019); Jia et al., (2019a)).
 However, they rely on having examples from each of the classification task’s classes, which prevents their application to OCC tasks.
 For example, signal reconstruction or forecasting could improve the intermediate representation by capturing the underlying data-generating process.
 To wit, it is necessary for the multivariate survival function of the considered random vector to be approximately homogeneous of degree −1, up to appropriate marginal standardization.
Figure 1a and its caption show the three types of influence in the model.
 We believe this is the first time probabilistic abstract interpretation has been applied in the context of neural networks.
 Each processor has access to the current parameter vector of the model.
 In particular, it was shown that the spectrum of the conjugate kernel of wide fully-connected networks approached a well-defined, data-independent, limit when the depth exceeds a certain scale, ξ.
Such point-based representations have achieved great results for many tasks, but lack flexibility.
 Our objective is to find a solution to the problem of memorization of long sequences.
 However, all these approaches typically introduce artificats (e.g, sparsity in the weights or activations) and can be defeated by carefully crafted attacks (Athalye et al., 2018).
 For graphs, a similar hierarchical abstraction is particularly important for maintaining the structural information and deriving a faithful feature representation.
 Transformer has shown outstanding performance in natural language generation tasks.
 Their primary theoretical result was that, in expectation, the length of a one-dimensional trajectory which is passed through a fully-connected, Gaussian network is lower bounded by a factor that is exponential with depth, but not with width.
 As shown in fig.  1, the output image of an denoising model could easily be recognized by a human as a bird, but a recognition model classifies it as a kite.
 Note that for physical observation modeling problems of this type, there is never any direct supervision available.
 Similarly, by losing the diversity of the ensemble, this simple form of distillation makes it impossible to estimate measures of uncertainty such as model uncertainty (Depeweg et al., 2017; Malinin et al., 2019).
 Despite the impressive achievements, they inevitably have a problem of high variance due to the use of reinforcement learning (RL) strategies.
 We argue that value function can be considered as an example of the former, while a planner as an example of the latter.
In this paper, we introduce a novel attack SemanticAdv which generates unrestricted perturbations with semantically meaningful patterns.
 Another technique reduces the computational complexity of MCMC by initialising the Markov simulation from a pretrained variational approximation (Hoffman, 2017; Han et al., 2017).
 One key advantage to this formulation is that single model can be trained that can capture the full expressivity of the underlying concept, allowing us to compute conditionals and marginals along with the joint.
Recently, many GNN architectures are proposed (Zhou et al., 2018) with their own graph filter designs.
 For each dataset, we use a separate pair of pre-trained image classifiers and inpainters.
 Our model takes inspiration from the idea that the degree of freedom of F (x) can be significantly reduced when it is modeled a linear combination of sparsifying basis functions.
 Extensive experimental results show that by repeating the same set of neurons, ACNs achieve unprecedented compression in terms of the total neural network parameters, with a minimal compromise on the prediction quality.
This makes it an example of a specification problem (Leike et al., 2017; Ortega & Maini, 2018): we did not intend the robot to ensure its predictions were good using such a strategy, yet a naive specification (e.g, maximizing likelihood) incentivized that strategy.
To further improve the performance of FMs, numerous variants have been proposed (Blondel et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2017; He & Chua, 2017; Juan et al., 2016; Lian et al., 2018; Qu et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2017).
 These prediction-based methods differ in the targets of prediction.
 Mithun et al., (2019) seeks to circumvent these problems by proposing to address this task in the weakly-supervised setting where only full video-sentence pairs are provided as weak labels.
Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC, van den Oord et al., 2018) is an unsupervised objective which learns such predictable representations.
 However, as DFT calculations are proportional to the number of interacting electrons (Lanyon et al., 2010), computation for large systems remains intractable.
Imitation learning frameworks generally make certain assumptions of the optimality of the demonstrations (Ziebart et al., 2008; Levine, 2018), yet never considered the scenario when the experts specifically attempt to be adversarial to the imitator.
 As such, an understanding of the latent structure from one embedding task (e.g, word embedding) might be useful to another (e.g, knowledge graph entity embedding).
 Intuitively, we may ask: Is it really necessary to train a deep neural network with massive samples? Are we able to select a subset of most representative samples for network training which can save the annotation cost, improve data efficiency and lead to an at least equivalent or even better model? To the best of our knowledge, this is a less explored domain in deep learning and relevant applications, where a lot of efforts have been put into optimizing the network designs.
 Without certain predefined constraints, existed methods fail to find a feasible policy.
 Today, state-of-the-art training platforms support 16-bit precision in the form of high-performance systolic array or GEMM engine (General Matrix Multiply) implementations (Markidis et al., 2018; Köster et al., 2017a).
 Here, we use the term surrogate gradients for directions that are correlated but usually not equal to the true gradient, e.g, they might be biased or unbiased approximations of the gradient.
 Experimental neuroscientists can record some variables within the brain (e.g, the output of a complex cell in primary visual cortex) but not others (e.g, the pre-synaptic simple cells), and many biological neurons appear to be well modeled as the ReLU of a linear combination of their inputs (Chance et al., 2002).
 While imitation learning has been successfully applied to a wide range of tasks including table-tennis Mülling et al., (2013), locomotion Chalodhorn et al., (2007), and human-robot interaction Amor et al., (2014) an important question is how to incorporate language and vision into a differentiable end-to-end system for complex robot control.
Recently, inspired by the deep learning techniques, SR problem is instead turn to the data-driven approaches.
 More importantly, many applications such as those in natural language processing may only have non-graph structured data or even just the original feature matrix, requiring additional graph construction from the original data matrix to formulate graph data.
In random forests, multiple decision trees are learned by optimizing the information gain for the randomly selected subset features at each node split.
 Additionally, audio systems typically use recurrent architectures (Chiu et al., 2017) which computer vision verifiers do not handle as they focus on fully-connected, convolutional and residual architectures.
 This generalization means that we can now apply and study the effectiveness of smoothing across a wider range of interesting perturbations (e.g, image rotation and translation), not previously possible.
 BNN executes NN inference for dozens of samples from weight distributions.
 Exploiting weight-space symmetries, we give insights into and partial explanations of three observations on neural network landscapes.
 In recent studies, many methods focused on the intermediate representation of the teacher network, in which the feature map (Romero et al., 2015), attention map (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016a) or the factor (Kim et al., 2018) extracted from student network are induced to mimic the corresponding one from teacher network by minimizing the difference between them.
In this work, we investigate the origin of adversarial vulnerability in neural networks by focusing on the attack algorithms used to find adversarial examples.
 Hence, these works have studied conditions under which GDA converges to a globally optimal solution under a convex-concave objective, or different types of locally optimal solutions under nonconvex-concave or nonconvex-nonconcave objectives.
 On other hand, a topic (Blei et al., 2003; Gupta et al., 2019) has a global word context (view): TM infers topic distributions across documents in the corpus and assigns a topic to each word occurrence, where the assignment is equally dependent on all other words appearing in the same document.
 In other words, there is a lack of generalization gap from the training environment to the test environment (Cobbe et al., 2018).
5h on average” on the Cityscapes dataset (Cordts et al., 2016).
 Specifically, ER-based methods are useful when we can access previous task data though the amount of past data is limited.
Although discovered skills are both distinguishable and diverse, it is still exceedingly difficult to integrate such skills for a complex task that requires smooth transitions between skills (Lee et al., (2018)).
 Program synthesis problems involve human priors as well.
 A main challenge with these traditional techniques is to predict data in large occluded or empty areas, e.g, where more than 50% of the data has to be predicted.
 The forward and backward loop of a BNN, therefore, becomes similar to the full-precision neural network with hard hyperbolic tangent htanh activation.
 It is shown that weight pruning can result in a notable reduction in the model size.
 We humans, equipped with such 3D representation in our brain (Yamane et al., 2008), can retain consistency on the identity of an object even if it is observed from different viewpoints.
 Such high latency cause severe scalability† issue for distributed training.
 These decoders first read k tokens from the source, after which they proceed to alternatingly produce a target symbol and read another source symbol.
 This is because it can first maximize the second summand and then modify its value in -neighborhoods of the true data to maximize the first summand.
 To provide interpretability, existing works try to produce a single prediction and observe the classification performance of each layer (Papernot & McDaniel, 2018; Szegedy et al., 2013; Kaya et al., 2019).
 However, deterministic physics engines will either predict one trajectory or the other.
The key component of these models is one-dimensional (1-D) graph convolution, a function that naturally combines graph structures and node contents by aggregating a node’s features with its neighbours’.
 The idea of smallest sufficient region (SSR) and smallest destroying region (SDR) (Fong & Vedaldi, 2017; Dabkowski & Gal, 2017) is worth noting because it considers the ranking of the feature attribution scores, not the actual score itself.
However, there is one notable drawback of GANs compared to classical generative models like Gaussian Mixture Models by Xu & Jordan (1996) or Naive Bayes classifiers by McCallum et al., (1998).
 Our contributions are summarized as follows:
 Lew recorded the inputs orthogonal and attempted orthogonal encoding at all hidden layers (McRae & Hetherington (1993), French (1994)).
Here we take a very different approach.
3 While the two occurrences of each phrase share the meaning, they are used in different structural (syntactic) configurations, serving different roles within the sentence (appearing in subject vs object position).
 Arguments like this may lead to rigorous guarantee for generalization.
 To ensure convergence, machine learning practitioners have to either increase the mini-batch size or decrease the learning rate toward the end of the training (Smith et al., 2017; Ge et al., 2019).
 A nice remedy to this problem is to replace the quantities affected by quantization (or at least their derivatives) by some smooth approximation during training, as is done in recent approaches, e.g, Ballé et al., (2016); Theis et al., (2017); Ballé et al., (2018); Mentzer et al., (2018); Johnston et al., (2018).
 Sometimes the regularization is explicit, as in the case of Tikhonov or `1 regularization (Krogh & Hertz, 1992; Bishop, 1995; Han et al., 2015; Bartlett et al., 2017).
Some heuristic methods for exploration, such as -greedy (Silver et al., 2016; Sutton & Barto, 1998), uniform sampling (Mnih et al., 2015) and i.i.d./correlated Gaussian noise (Lillicrap et al., 2016; Schulman et al., 2015), try to directly obtain more different experiences during exploration.
 Prior work in deep reinforcement learning has explored generalization over environments (Cobbe et al., 2018; Nichol et al., 2018), and tasks (Finn et al., 2017; Parisi et al., 2018).
 In an application such as high-throughput virtual screening the cost of misrepresenting the noise during the screening process could amount to a year wasted in the physical synthesis of a drug 14.
In this paper we further advance this localized approach to DL on graphs and propose a fractional generalized graph-based convolutional filter for semi-supervised learning, which casts the Lévy Flights into random walks on graphs.
 Each classifier in our set is analogous to an agent in a crowdsourcing setting.
 In order to efficiently apply model-based planning in high-dimensional spaces, a promising approach is to learn a low-dimensional latent state representation of the original high-dimensional space.
 Finally, a tree based decoder will decode the generated adversarial continuous embedding vector back to the sentence level based on the tree grammar rules, aiming to both pre-serve the original semantic meaning and linguistic coherence.
Instead, we formulate learning as an evidence acquisition process, where the model can acquire evidence during training in support of its prediction (Sensoy et al., 2018; Malinin & Gales, 2018).
 In this way, the agent can escape from the local optimum caused by insufficient state exploration.
 But it also causes new problems.
 Take sentence classification as an example.
 Due to variations in sonogram machines and medical training of sonographers, a domain shift is likely to occur in the test samples; hence we need to apply uDA to adapt the source classifier in the target domains.
 In turn, we use these to both make RC models more sensitive when they should be, and more robust in the presence of biased training data.fig. 1 shows an examples for a BERT LARGE model (Devlin et al., 2019) trained on SQuAD2.0 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018) that is given a text and a comprehension question, i.g,”What was Fort Carolinerenamed to after the Spanish attack?” which it correctly answers as ”San Mateo” with 98% confidence.
 This approach should reduce the size of the required labeled data since language models learn the language syntax and semantic in an unsupervised way on a very large unlabeled corpora by predicting the next word.
 More specifically, we constructed a 128-dimensional vector for each protein where the first 64 dimensions are derived from the amino acid sequence and the remaining 64 dimensions are obtained from embedding the protein into a tissue-specific protein-protein interaction networks.
Our contributions are two-fold:
 Random embeddings come with several strong theoretical guarantees, but have shown mixed empirical performance for HDBO.
 Despite their simplicity, deep linear networks capture the essential nonlinear relationship between network’s input-output maps and their parameters, and exhibit comparable learning behavior to their nonlinear counterparts that can be exactly solved for rigorous analysis.
 Automatic ICD coding for both seen and unseen codes fits into the generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) paradigm (Chao et al., 2016), where test examples are from both seen and unseen classes and we classify them into the joint labeling space of both types of classes.
 This may however be at the expense of Gaussianity and linearity assumptions, which do not often apply for real signals and images.
In this work, we specifically address the problem of meta-learning initializations for deep neural networks that must produce dense, structured output, such as for the semantic segmentation of images.
 The feasibility of computing gradient on large minibatches in parallel due to recent hardware advances has seen the resurgence of simply using synchronous SGD with large minibatches as an alternative to asynchronous SGD.
 However, the decision which labels are noisy and which are not is decisive for learning robust models.
 Failing to utilize the rich text structure information beyond the simple word sequence may limit the effectiveness of these models for QG.
 For instance, the performance of the learning process can degrade when unrelated tasks are used together (Caruana, 1997; Baxter, 2000); another detrimental issue may occur when the training of a single model is not balanced properly among multiple tasks (Hessel et al., 2018).
 We do so by comparing a setting where the reward is informative, vs. one where it is constant.
 However, none of them explicitly models the relationships among different nodes and thus may ignore important structural information.
 This is in contrast to some early works which incorporate learning strategy.1We assume graphs are of equal size for narrative simplicity.
 For example, the Pubmed graph dataset (Sen et al., 2008) consists ∗Corresponding author: Zhen Cui.
 Since the true reward function for the task is unknown, these methods construct a reward signal from the demonstrations through adversarial training, making them difficult to implement and use in practice (Kurach et al., 2018).
We introduce Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles (NODE), a new DNN architecture, designed to work with tabular problems.
 The refinery of noisy pseudo labels has crucial influences to the final performance, but is mostly ignored by the clustering-based UDA methods.
In this paper, we thus consider the problem of discovering new visual classes automatically, assuming that a certain number of classes are already known by the model (Hsu et al., 2018; 2019; Han et al., 2019).
 More recently, experiments across several domains suggest that this overestimation problem is common (Hado van Hasselt et al., 2016).
There is a large body of existing work on unsupervised domain adaptation (Long et al., 2015; Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015; Tzeng et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2017; Gong et al., 2012; Long et al., 2018), but the federated setting presents several additional challenges.
 Moreover, Dehghani et al., (2018) fix the number of steps for large-scale machine translation whereas we vary the number of steps to demonstrate substantial improvements in speed at no loss in accuracy.
 On the other hand, the `0 regularizer directly reflects the real sparsity of weights and is scale invariant (i.g, ||αW ||0= ||W ||0,∀α 6= 0), yet the `0 norm cannot provide useful gradients.
We perform a series of experiments on the Penn Tree Bank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1994a) and CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) datasets, in which we compared the state-of-the-art NAS algorithms whose code is publicly available—DARTS (Liu et al., 2019b), NAO (Luo et al., 2018) and ENAS (Pham et al., 2018)—to our random policy.
 Second, since VAE sampling is based on the implicit likelihood function encoded in the training data, if most of the training data is centered around a specific mode while other modes have less data (fig.  1 (a)), the VAE samples will reflect this bias and concentrate around the major mode (fig.  1 (b)).
 Assuming f is convex, analyzing the convergence was first attempted in Kingma & Ba (2015) and later concluded in Reddi et al., (2018).
 To achieve lifelong language learning on fundamentally different tasks, we propose LAMOL — LAnguage MOdeling for Lifelong language learning.
 Similar to previous example, the companies may leave when the government forces them to invest.
 These transformations have the same input/output dimension, i.g,, the dimension of the node representation.
 Posterior probability estimates (e.g, the softmax outputs) can be interpreted as confidence estimation, but it calibrates the decision quality poorly (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016) – the confidence tend to be large even when the classification is inaccurate.
DPP can be viewed from two perspectives: sampling and learning.
 Representatively, Yao et al., propose a hierarchically structured meta-learning method to customize the globally shared knowledge to each cluster (Yao et al., 2019b).
 Previous work (Ranganath et al., 2014; Schulman et al., 2015) shows the ability to automatically infer the latent variables and obtain gradient estimate in directed models.
Quantization technique is also closely related to the implementation of specialized hardware that maps the procedure of network inference onto the energy-efficient low-precision integer or fixedpoint arithmetic circuits.
 Although the labels are somehow related to instances inside the bags, the instances are not explicitly labeled.
However, to deploy continual learning to real-world systems, there are a number of issues that should be resolved.
Many approaches to continual learning employ an architecture which is divided a priori into (i) a slowly evolving, global part; and (ii) a quickly evolving, task-specific, local part.
 Intuitively, if we can alter the representation in a layer whose features are representative of the data for the given task, but not specific to the model, the adversarial example may transfer better (to unobserved architectures) than attacks derived from logit-layer information.
 This line of research motivated us to study a framework that combines the strength of Operations Research (OR) heuristics with learning capabilities of machine learning (RL in particular).
 However, the search space of choosing a QBN for each weight kernel is too large, so prior kernel-wise network quantization (Zeng et al., 2019; Choukroun et al., 2019b; Zhang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Krishnamoorthi, 2018; Sasaki et al., 2019) still uses the same QBN for the entire CNN.
 These questions are fundamental to understand and improve existing NAS algorithms.
 The agent uses its local observations to update its beliefs (McAllester & Singh, 2013; Babayan et al., 2018).
 These inherent issues limit their sample-efficiency.
 Secondly, estimating MI in high-dimensional spaces is a notoriously difficult task, and in practice one often maximizes a tractable lower bound on this quantity (Poole et al., 2019).
 For instance, an agent can overfit to the MDP dynamics of the training set, such as for control in Mujoco (Pinto et al., 2017; Rajeswaran et al., 2017).
 As such, existing transformationbased defenses take a majority vote of the CNN predictions from the randomly transformed image (Prakash et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2017).
How to determine the optimal clipping threshold to balance clipping range and projection resolution? The resolution indicates the interval between two quantization levels; the smaller the interval, the higher the resolution.
 Existing works on avoiding traversing the whole game tree can be mainly divided into two categories: Pruning-based CFR (Brown & Sandholm, 2015; 2017a) and Monte-Carlo CFR (MC-CFR) (Lanctot et al., 2009).
 However, ideally, well learned DNNs with high robustness usually comprehensively encode various types of discriminative features and keep a good balance between the completeness and the discrimination power of features (Wolchover, 2017).
 However, these approaches often produce ghosting artifacts due to view blending on inaccurate geometry, or artifacts at occlusion boundaries.
Despite the aforementioned phenomenal success achieved by deep neural networks, it is observed that adversarially constructed small perturbation to the input can potentially fool the network into making wrong predictions with high confidence (Szegedy et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015).
 Since such structured evidence (graphs, tables, or databases) are also ubiquitous in real-world applications like database systems, dialog systems, commercial management systems, social networks, etc, we argue wikipedia as a conference paper at ICLR 2020United States House of Representatives Elections, 1972that the fact verification under structured evidence forms is an equivalently important yet underexplored problem.
 A control unit then reads the programs from the memory and executes them with the data.
 As the planning horizon increases model error compounds, and the cost function often provides only a noisy or sparse signal of the objective.
 Each agent performs decentralized control based on its local observations and messages from connected neighbors.
 The elements in the target set have an arbitrary order, so a standard reconstruction loss cannot be used naïvely – the decoder would have to somehow output the elements in the same arbitrary order.
 Then, we introduce the intuition behind our proposal in detail (§3), which is motivated by our observation that we can cluster words in a sentence according to the similarity of their attention distributions over words in the sentence.
 A question is: can we construct structured explanations other than a path to better explain reasoning in graph context.
 They are usually off-the-shelf for different classifiers, and generally aim to disturb the adversarial perturbations, as shown in fig.  1(b).
 Worse still, the independent representations may mismatch human’s predefined concepts (Locatello et al., 2019).
 Finegan-Dollak et al., (2018), for example, propose to test on different output patterns than are in the train set, while Lake & Baroni (2018) propose, among others, to split examples by output length or to test on examples containing primitives that are rarely shown during training.
 Although the AT methods are relatively strong, they could sacrifice accuracy on clean inputs and are computationally expensive (Xie et al., 2019).
 To1 Mila, University of Montreal,2 Deepmind, 3 University of California, Berkeley, :anirudhgoyal9119@gmail.comaddress this issue, we propose to divide our input into two categories: standard input and privileged input, and then we aim to design a bottleneck that does not need to access the privileged input before deciding how much information about the input is necessary.
 In statistical physics, it is posited that the arrow of time (i.g, entropy production) is driven by irreversible processes (Prigogine, 1978; Seifert, 2012).
 In intuition, global structure features tend to be robust against adversarial perturbations but hard to generalize for unseen shape variations, instead, local features generalize well for unseen shape variations but are hard to generalize on adversarial perturbation.
 Explaining the decisions made by CNNs might even become a legal requirement in certain applications (Alber et al., (2018)).
 Here, we are forced to approximate treatment effects from off-line datasets collected through Observational Studies.
 Despite methods that learn representations generally being more flexible, more scalable, and often leading to better performance, before this paper, covering options could not be easily combined with modern representation learning techniques.
 We propose that these phenomena relates deeply with the singularities of distribution transport maps.
In accordance with this hypothesis, we introduce a generalisation of the Transformer architecture, the 2-simplicial Transformer, which incorporates both 2- and 3-way interactions.
 To this end, our goal is to build an agent that can first infer a policy from∗Work done as a one demonstration, then attempt the task using that policy while receiving binary user feedback, and finally use the feedback to improve its policy such that it can consistently solve the task.
 To the best of our knowledge, no existing attacks on objection detection can achieve such a high success rate (Eykholt et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2017a;b; Zhao et al., 2018b; Chen et al., 2018).
 Some methods leverage the predictions from DNNs to correct labels and modify the loss accordingly (Reed et al., 2015; Tanaka et al., 2018).
 The inner maximization generates adversarial examples that can be used by the outer minimization to train robust DNNs.
 For a few individual levels in DMLab and Atari we also show that V-MPO can achieve scores that are substantially higher than has previously been reported in the single-task setting, especially in the challenging Ms. Pacman.V-MPO is also applicable to problems with high-dimensional, continuous action spaces.
 More precisely, we turn the original real-valued features into complex-valued ones, rotate these features by a random angle, and feed them to the cloud for further processing.
As we show in this work, both theoretically and empirically, Nesterov SGD with any parameter selection does not in general provide acceleration over ordinary SGD.
 This is consistent with the theoretical result of Locatello et al., (2019b) that the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations is impossible without inductive biases.
Specifically, we consider feed-forward ReLU networks, with weight matrices W1, . ,WL, and biases b1, . ,bL,.
 With complex data like audio or images, this strategy was long thought to be unattainable due to the difficulty of learning a sufficiently good model.
 Knowing that a sufficiently large network can be used to solve any problem does not reveal much about how neural networks should be designed in practice.
 If the environment of a deployed machine learning system changes frequently, traditional methods like jointly training all domains require the learning machine to be re-trained from scratch every time a new domain comes.
 It would be preferable to have an algorithm that could automatically generate a curriculum for agents as they learn.
 However, RS usually has worse asymptotic performance than model-free controllers (Nagabandi et al., 2017), and the authors of the the PETS algorithm (Chua et al., 2018) suggest that the performance of RS is directly affected by the quality of the learnt dynamics.
 Consider a state s in the demonstration and its nearby state s̃ that is not in the demonstration.
 This means that we are eschewing discussions of off-policy data, exploration, sampling variance, and step size.
 Words that are highly informative for one task may not be relevant for other tasks.
 It should be noted that Algorithm 1 is the default momentum-method in popular software1Heavy ball momentum is the default choice of momentum method in PyTorch and Tensorflow, instead of Nesterov’s momentum.
 Similarly, in financial trading an attacker can send orders to an exchange which will appear in the victim’s market data feed, but the attacker cannot modify observations of a third party’s orders.
 Such a model could be useful for learning representations for further downstream tasks (Mathieu et al., 2016), or could even be used directly in applications where predicting the future enables effective decision making and control, such as robotics (Finn et al., 2016).
 The graph filter banks are mathematically designed and are adopted to scatter an input graph signal into multiple channels.
 However, existing pretraining objectives are usually defined at the token level and do not explicitly model entity-centric knowledge.
 Therefore, updating a neural network to change its predictions on a single input can decrease performance across other inputs.
 For example, the winner ofthe most recent branch prediction championship increased precision by 3.7% (Dundas, 2016).(Section 4.6).
 For example, human-designed architectures for real-time segmentation (Zhao et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018a) commonly exploit multi-resolution branches with proper depth, width, operators, and downsample rates, and find them contributing vitally to the success: such flexibility has not been unleashed by existing NAS segmentation efforts.
 Traditionally, generative approaches, which are usually conducted in an unsupervised learning manner, are developed for learning the data distribution from its samples, from which subsequently, they produce novel and high-dimensional samples, such as the synthesized image Saito et al., (2018).
 However, all of these works only consider learning a linear predictive model.
 Moreover, attack iterations are usually quite expensive.
 Instead, in this paper we develop methods for detecting adversarial examples by making use of class-conditional reconstruction networks.
 In fact, Carlini & Wagner (2017a) and Athalye et al., (2018) showed that the detection methods presented in (Bhagoji et al., 2017; Feinman et al., 2017; Gong et al., 2017; Grosse et al., 2017; Metzen et al., 2017; Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2017; Li & Li, 2017; Ma et al., 2018), are significantly less effective than their claims under adaptive attacks.
Another category is based on model-free RL methods with recurrent neural networks (RNN) as function approximators (Schmidhuber, 1990; 1991; Igl et al., 2018; Kapturowski et al., 2018; Jaderberg et al., 2019), which is usually more tractable to implement.
 We will refer to this method as the resetting method in this paper.
 While the best way to design games to favour language emergence is still open to debate, there is a consensus on the fact that we should gear these emergent languages towards sharing similarities with natural language.
 On the contrary, the success rate of score-based attack has only small gap to the white-box attack but it requires many queries.
 Model comparison based on a limited number of samples assumes that they are sufficiently representative of the whole population, an assumption that has been proven to be doubtful in image classification.
 Unlike mixout(u), dropout encourages a move toward the origin which deviates away from u since dropout is equivalent to mixout(0).
 In the first category, the algorithm is allowed to query the outcome of any state action pair from an oracle.
 The matrix D is learned together with the classifier by minimizing a classification loss over a training set.
 Moreover, data-dependent methods for model compression (e.g, Mozer & Smolensky (1989); Srivastava et al., (2014); Hu et al., (2016); Yu et al., (2018); Baykal et al., (2018)) rely on the statistics presented in a data set.
Motivated by this observation, we employ blurring to prevent the OOD detector from overfitting to low resolution.
∗Both authors contributed equally.
 Despite their simplicity, it has been pointed out that their modeling capability is bottlenecked by the deterministic state transitions (Chung et al., 2015; Fraccaro et al., 2016) and the oversimplified observation distributions (Yang et al., 2018).
 This synchronization policy determines in each step, i.g,whenever a gradient is pushed by some worker, the state (“run” or “wait”) of each worker, until the next update arrives at the parameter server.
 More recently, Palmer et al., (2018) extended the idea of leniency (Potter & Jong, 1994; Panait et al., 2008) to deep MARL and proposed the retroactive temperature decay schedule to address stochastic rewards problems.
 This can be readily generalized to separate different motion elements.
In this paper, aiming at avoiding such a pitfall, we propose to learn an identifiable generative model through flows (short for normalizing flows (Tabak et al., 2010; Rezende & Mohamed, 2015)).
 However, existing certified robustness results are limited to top-1 predictions, leaving top-k robustness unexplored.
While initialising a neural network optimistically would be trivial, e.g, by setting the bias of the final layer of the network, the uncontrolled generalisation in neural networks changes this initialisation quickly.
 There lacks a common ground for studying the feature design and pretraining of visual-linguistic tasks in general.
 Modeling of geometric transformations has been a constant pursuit for vision researchers over decades (Lowe et al., 1999; Lazebnik et al., 2006; Jaderberg et al., 2015; Dai et al., 2017).
 This form of uncertainty arises when the test input x∗ comes either from a different distribution than the one that generated the training data or from an in-domain region which is sparsely covered by the training data.
 Unlike cloud computing, dedicated networks are expensive and therefore not available to most users.
 The use of Euclidean distance, however, has at least two downsides.
We empirically explore the behavior of the generalization error over a wide range of datasets and models in vision and language tasks.
 Typically A is a set of KB entities—e.g, if q is the first sample question above, A would be1 the singleton set containing Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.
 We note that inferring loop invariants can be posed as learning formulas in Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) (Biere et al., 2009) over program variables collected from program execution traces (Nguyen et al., 2017).
 But is a method with a more (manually) tuned search space a better AutoML algorithm? If the key idea behind NAS is to find the optimal architecture, without human intervention, why are we devoting so much energy to infuse expert knowledge into the pipeline? Furthermore, the lack of ablation studies in most works makes it harder to pinpoint which components are instrumental to the final performance, which can easily lead to Hypothesizing After the Results are Known (HARKing; Gencoglu et al., 2019).
To date, most of the existing models for video prediction employ a hybrid of convolutional and recurrent layers as the underlying architecture (Wang et al., (2017); Shi et al., (2015); Lotter et al., (2016)).
 Thus, order learning is related to LTR and ordinal regression.
 To push the development of models in logical reasoning from simple logical relationship classification to multiple complicated logical reasoning and from sentence-level to passage-level, it is necessary to introduce a reading comprehension dataset targeting logical reasoning.
In this paper, we uncover the problematic failure mode where representations learned by VAEs exhibit over-sensitivity to semantically-irrelevant changes in data.
 A major weakness of VAEs is∗Equal contribution.
 The ERF is only small Gaussian-like factor of theoretical receptive field (TRF), but it dominates the output (Luo et al., 2016).
Currently, the generalization capability of an agent is—in the best case—evaluated on a validation set of scenarios.
 In literature, such models are usually evaluated on chemical and social domains (Xu et al., 2019).
 This motivates generalization bounds in terms of distance from initialization (Dziugaite and Roy, 2017; Bartlett et al., 2017).
 Despite the outstanding performance, Reddi et al., (2018) pointed out that Adam suffers the non-convergence issue, and developed two modified versions, namely AMSgrad and AdamNC.
 Old data may be outdated and can even deteriorate learning if the drift in the data distribution is neglected.
 We argue that these operations should feature more widely in neural networks in and of themselves, especially in theincreasingly important setting of integrating multiple streams of information (including endogenously created streams e.g, in branching architectures).
 However, when it comes to GNNs, experimental studies have shown that an increase in the number of layers results in dramatic performance drops in GNNs (Wu et al., 2019; Li et al., 2018b).
 BC treats the IL problem as supervised learning.
 For example, Google Cloud ML tutorial suggests using Google’s Inception V3 model as a pre-trained model and Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) suggests using ResNet18 as a pre-trained model for tasks such as flower classification Wang et al.,(2018).
As a step towards application of knowledge-grounded dialogue generation in real-world systems, we explore how to learn a model with as few knowledge-grounded dialogues as possible, yet the model achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes well on out-of-domain documents.
 Figure 1 shows some generated left and right view images for a given single image input by our Deep 3D Pan pipeline, which we call it the “monster-net” (monocular to stereo network).
We propose a novel attention-based method that encodes trees in a bottom-up manner and executes competitively with the Transformer at constant parallel time complexity.
We compute the limit of the first moment Tr (S) and characterize its evolution during training, of the second moment Tr ( S2 ) which stays constant during training, and show that the higher moments vanish.
 As a result, the optimal policy ofeach agent depends solely on its own state and the aggregated effect of the population, and such an optimal policy is symmetric across all the agents.
 Moreover, enforcing a set of properties during the training procedure can significantly affect the accuracy of the network on the primary task.
Unfortunately, although MMD-nets work well on low dimensional data, these networks have not on their own matched the generative performance of adversarial methods on higher dimensional datasets, such as natural images (Dziugaite et al., 2015).
 Then useful properties might include functions that check if the input and output lists have the same length, if the input list is a subset of the output, if element 0 of the output list is less than element 42, and so on.
 TSN uniformly samples multiple clips from the entire video, and the average scores are used to guide back-propagation during training.
Work was done during an internship at Microsoft.
 This is a natural choice for dynamical systems, and prior works have explored learning such distances in simple and low-dimensional domains (Kaelbling, 1993).
 Updates to the meta-learner is computed based on the performance of the classifier on the query set.
In our experiments on ad-click recommendation, we found that the interpretations generated by GLIDER are illuminating, and the detected global interactions can significantly improve the target model’s prediction performance.
 These limitations challenge the effectiveness of these methods for estimating or optimizing MI.
 Rather it involves a creative interplay between external stimulation and an active, internal generative model of the world (Rao & Ballard, 1999; Friston, 2005).
 Without further information about the relative trade-off between the two dimensions it is impossible to claim which is superior (Figure 1, left subplot).
 For example, Mao et al., (2019) explicitly maximizes the ratio of the distance between generated images with respect to the corresponding latent codes; while Zhu et al., (2017b) applies an auxiliary network for decoding the latent codes from the generative images.
 Early work with low precision deep networks used a simple fixed configuration for the quantizer (Hubara et al., 2016; Esser et al., 2016), while starting with Rastegari et al., (2016), later work focused on fitting the quantizer to the data, either based on statistics of the data distribution (Li & Liu, 2016; Zhou et al., 2016; Cai et al., 2017; McKinstry et al., 2018) or seeking to minimize quantization error during training (Choi et al., 2018c; Zhang et al., 2018).
 Consider the dog at the top-left.
 This can lead to undesired biases and performance properties for learned models.
 Most recently work has sought to reduce this complexity by means of data-/time-dependent priors Ilyas et al., (2019).
 Such samples could be hand labeled by a domain expert for instance.
Work done while at Argo AI.
While there has been ample work on learning compact representations, learning sparse higher dimensional representations have been addressed only recently (Jeong and Song, 2018; Cao et al., 2018).
 The first approach is the so-called batch TD, which takes a fixed sample set and transforms the empirical mean square projected Bellman error (MSPBE) into an equivalent convex-concave saddle-point problem Du et al., (2017).
 First, one estimates the density ratio of states and actions between the target distribution and the behavior policy.
∗Equal contributionDespite the popularity of MAML, and the numerous followups and extensions, there remains a fundamental open question on the basic algorithm.
Starting from only simple methane molecules, our algorithm outperforms other generative models in optimization tasks for molecular design.
 This is evidently more complicated than the linear case in (1.1).
 Possible candidates include the problem being (i) a by-product of the model architecture, e.g, the Transformer architecture preferring repeats (Holtzman et al., 2019; Vig, 2018), (ii) an intrinsic property of human language (Holtzman et al., 2019) rather than a modeling deficiency, or that (iii) a training objective relying on fixed corpora cannot take into account the real goal of using the language (Choi, 2018).
 Even if they did, a lengthy human post-processing stage is necessary to identify what the model has learned on any given training run.
With this motivation, we present local ensembles, a post-hoc method for measuring the extent to which a pre-trained model’s prediction is underdetermined for a particular test input.
 In this research, we will demonstrate that by using mode connectivity in loss landscapes, we can repair backdoored or error-injected DNNs.
 In such cases, each data-owner can benefit from information learned from other tasks, but each also desires, or is legally required, to keep their raw data private.
 Most recent methods obtain very high accuracy on Omniglot, rendering the comparisons between them mostly uninformative. mini-ImageNet is formed out of 100 ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) classes (64/16/20 for train/validation/test) and contains 600 examples per class.
 Recently, BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), along with its many successors such as XLNet (Yang et al., 2019b) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), has led to significant improvements to many NLP tasks such as sentence pairs classification and question-answering.
 Planning enables these approaches to perform new tasks at test-time.
 Instead, the multi-goal scenario can benefit from fine-grained credit assignment that leverages available structure in action-goal interactions, such as local interactions where only few agents affect another agent’s goal attainment at any time.
 A commonly used algorithm proposed in this setting, also called Boundary attack (Brendel et al., 2017), is based on random walks on the decision surface, but it does not have any convergence guarantee.
 The current approaches are oblivious to the patterns in the design space of schedules that are available for exploitation, and causes inefficient search or even converges to solutions that may even be suboptimal.
 For the orientation-tilt illusion, neural populations encoding the surrounding grating can either suppress or facilitate the activity of neural populations encoding the central grating, leading to repulsion vs. attraction, respectively.
 We also leverage the structure of CNNs and available annotations from ZSL datasets as a means of interpreting various models in terms of these factors.
 However, this intuition has not been rigorously tested, leading to three important open questions:∗Equal Contribution.
 We call such attacking scheme centralized backdoor attack.
A seemingly unrelated area of deep learning research is that of quantized neural networks (QNNs), which offer advantages of computational and memory efficiency compared to continuous-valued models.
 In all, this has created an environment where approaches such as Batch Normalization are still used as-is, unchanged since their creation.
Although ZO optimization is popular for solving ML problems, the performance of existing algorithms is barely satisfactory.
However, this paradigm – of a single parameter server and thousands of (typically CPU) workers – appears to be fundamentally incompatible with the needs of modern computer vision and robotics communities.
 The goal is to choose τ to minimize calibration error, which roughly speaking measures the degree to which the reported error rate differs from the actual error rate.
 Along this line of work, researchers have explored tuning the bitwidth per layer (Wu et al., 2018b; Wang et al., 2019; Dong et al., 2019) as well as various types of quantization functions (Wang et al., 2018; Courbariaux et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016).
 We find, however, that it is non-trivial to extend NMNs for answering non-synthetic questions against open-domain text, where a model needs to deal with∗Work done while at Allen Institute for AI.
 This procedure is shown in Figure 1.
 To further enhance its text generation performance and allow synthesizing photo-realistic images given an image, text, or random noise, we feed the variational posterior of VHE in lieu of random noise as the source of randomness into the image generator of a generative adversarial network (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014).
 One of them (S1) is to search an architecture for a new task from scratch but it is inefficient and not flexible for practical application scenarios.
 Knowledge graphs provide us with an intuitive way of representing these partially observable worlds.
 We refer to this approach as learning controllable embedding (LCE).
 The supervision signal is driven by how a known classical algorithm would process such inputs (including any relevant intermediate outputs), providing explicit (and reusable) guidance on how to tackle graph-structured problems.
 Based on this observation, our goal of compression can be achieved by encouraging filters to share weights.
 Initial attempts at learning representations for relations in graphs (Monti et al., 2018; Beck et al., 2018) have shown some performance gains on tasks like node classification and neural machine translation.
 This is the approach employed in this paper.
 In contrast, local elasticity is not observed in linear classifiers due to the leverage effect (Weisberg, 2005).
 The type of randomized-label experiments described above show that if there are common patterns to be found, then GD finds them.
 Clearly, this separation is in conflict with the above mentioned role of the hippocampus in generalisation – i.g,how can separated memories be chained together? Interestingly, a recent line of research (Kumaran & McClelland, 2012; Banino et al., 2016; Schapiro et al., 2017; Koster et al., 2018) sheds lights on this tension by showing that the integration of separated experiences emerges at the point of retrieval through a recurrent mechanism.
 For downstream tasks of DST that emphasize on low latency (e.g, generating real-time dialogue responses), auto-regressive approaches incur expensive time cost as the ongoing dialogues become more complex.
 (1)Here, x(t) ∈ Rd is the input signal, g(t) ∈ RD is the hidden state vector of D neurons, ġi(t) is the rate of change of the i-th state component; τ, α ∈ R+, referred to as the post-synaptic time-constant, impacts the rate of a neuron’s response to the instantaneous activation φ(Ug(t) +Wx(t) + b); and U ∈ RD×D, W ∈ RD×d, b ∈ RD are model parameters.
 However, follow-up work found that rewinding the weights to their values at some iteration early in the training of the unpruned model, rather than to their initial values, was necessary to achieve good performance on deeper networks such as ResNets (Frankle et al., 2019).
 Work was done when Junjie Yan was an intern at Megvii Technology.
A straightforward communication protocol for bandit learning is immediate sharing: each agent shares every new sample immediately with others.
 Geirhos et al., (2018) showed that ANNs trained on images with one type of distortion may not perform well when tested on other types of distortions, even if images with both distortions appear identical to the human eye.
 Ji & Telgarsky (2019); Gunasekar et al., (2018) investigated the implicit bias of GD for training deep linear networks and deep linear convolutional networks respectively.
 For example, the El Nino dataset (Bay et al., 2000) consists of measurements by weather buoys in the ocean, and one expects that nearby buoys can be grouped together.
 In the field of natural language processing, some early work have successfully applied self-training to word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995) and parsing (McClosky et al., 2006; Reichart & Rappoport, 2007; Huang & Harper, 2009).
 For popular Gaussian processes-based approaches (Williams & Rasmussen, 2006), the multivariate intensity often consists of independent and multi-output Gaussian processes.
 Second, even without considering user-defined types, the accuracy of these systems is relatively low, with the current state-of-theart achieving 56.9% accuracy for primitive/library types (Hellendoorn et al., 2018).
 To reflect the diverse characteristics presented in the face images “in-the-wild”, we therefore model the generation process by incorporating two latent factors into the neural network.
In this paper, we explore the link between view predictive learning and the emergence of 3D perception in computational models of perception, on mobile agents in static and dynamic scenes.
 Nevertheless, the common belief behind existing approaches is that designing proper sampling strategies, losses, or even more complex models, is useful for learning high-quality representations for long-tailed recognition.
 These include changing lighting/weather conditions, sensor noise, actuator noise, action delays etc (Dulac-Arnold et al., 2019).
 We propose here implicit uncertainty-guided importance representation.
 This calls a lot of attention on robustness in deep learning with noisy labels.
 In FL, raw data remains distributed across a fleet of devices, such as mobile phones, while an orchestrating server coordinates training of a shared global model.
 More recently, Lakshminarayanan et al., (2017) showed that deep ensembles give reliable predictive uncertainty estimates while remaining simple and scalable.
 The two significant critic points of CHL are the requirement for symmetric ”forward-backward” connections and the use of alternating ”forward” and ”backward” phases (Baldi & Pineda, 1991; Bartunov et al., 2018).
 Lutter et al., (2019) introduced deep Lagrangian networks specialized to learn Lagrangian mechanics with learnable parameters.
More recently, Hoogeboom et al., (2019) and Ho et al., (2019) have proposed flow-based methods for lossless compression, and Kingma et al., (2019) have presented ‘Bit-Swap’, extending BB-ANS to hierarchical models.
 In our experiments, we demonstrate in the experiments that IMPACT exceeds state-of-the-art agents in training time (with same hardware) while maintaining similar sample efficiency with PPO’s.
To overcome the aforementioned issues of MLE, it is common to refine a contextual sequence generation model pre-trained with MLE under the reinforcement learning (RL) framework (Zaremba & Sutskever, 2015; Ranzato et al., 2016; Bahdanau et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2018; Paulus et al., 2017).
 Several empirical observations point to an incomplete understanding.
 And, SNOW does require neither persistent training data nor episodic memories (Sprechmann et al., 2018; Li & Hoiem, 2018) to overcome catastrophic forgetting.
 It often finds more success in short-horizon problems like contextual bandits, but its variance often grows exponentially in the horizon, a phenomenon known as “the curse of horizon” (Liu et al., 2018).
 Later, several others have alluded to the same problem (Xu et al., 2018; Klicpera et al., 2019; Rong et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019) (See §5 Related Work).
 How to explain such generalization phenomenon is an intriguing theoretical question.
 Modal factors of variation are discrete values that correspond to isolated clusters in the data distribution, such as the category of the generated object.
 These insights, in turn, enable a more accurate prediction of future behavior and improvement in out-of-sample behavior.
 YZ would like to thank Chong You at UC Berkeley for meaningful discussions.
 Unfortunately, such solutions do not generalize well because the energy pattern of an appliance depends on its brand and can differ from one home to another (Kelly & Knottenbelt, 2015; Bonfigli et al., 2018).
 Using NTK analyses, the sample complexity bound for learning these functions can be poor whereas experimental evidence suggests that the sample complexity is mild (Livni et al., 2014).
 Constructing an effective abstraction, however, demands rich domain knowledge and its solution may be a coarse approximation of true equilibrium.
 Therefore, we might wonder: (1) How can we better understand BERT’s multilingualism? (2) Can we further improve BERT’s cross-lingual transfer?In this paper, we show that contextual embedding alignment is a useful concept for addressing these questions.
 Some prior work has evaluated the applicability of saliency maps for explaining the behavior of image classifiers (Samek et al., 2017; Adebayo et al., 2018; Kindermans et al., 2019), but there is not a corresponding literature evaluating the applicability of saliency maps for explaining RL agent behavior.
 The key idea is to resolve ambiguity by iteratively strengthening the initial specification I with new examples.
Summary of contributions.
 If the individual decision trees in a random forest are strengthened independently, it is likely for the trees to resemble the strongest tree in the forest, and consequently the correlation of the forest becomes high.
 For instance, many studies conduct fine-tuning of ResNets (He et al., 2016b) with these default hyperparameters: learning rate 0.01, momentum 0.9 and weight decay 0.1.
 SD, RL & AM ran the external baselines.
 Typically used 3D representations are voxel grids (Yan et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; Choy et al., 2016; Henzler et al., 2019), point clouds (Fan et al., 2017), and meshes (Rezende et al., 2016; Kato et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Kato & Harada, 2019).
 Prior work has considered heuristics like beam search (Feng et al., 2018) or bandits (Ribeiro et al., 2018a), but these are generally not guaranteed to find the worst-case reductions.
 These Jacobians visually resemble their corresponding images for robust models but look much noisier for standard non-robust models.
 This suggests that progress in the past few years may be less significant than it seems if one only looks at the mean accuracies.
have shown that robustness properties can be more easily verified for the smoothed version of a base classifier h producing labels in some set Y:hs(x) = arg max y∈Y P X∼µ(x) h(X) = y , (1)where the labels returned by the smoothed classifier hs are obtained by taking a “majority vote” over the predictions of the original classifier h on random inputs drawn from a probability distribution µ(x), called the smoothing measure.
 Let yT be the output of the teacher and yS be the output of the student.
 It is highly possible that some forms of equivalence are not covered in the training set, and fail to be recognized by the model.
 In addition, these data augmentation policies optimized on proxy tasks are not guaranteed to be optimal on the target task, and the fixed augmentation policy is also sub-optimal for the whole training process.
 How can we then perturb the training instances such that the perturbed instances will be actually helpful in lowering the test loss? Enforcing this generalization objective is not straightforward in standard learning framework since the test data is unobservable.
 On the other hand, we say it suffers from disparate impact if the decisions adversely affect a protected group of individuals with certain sensitive attribute – see Zafar et al., (2015).
 Optimal transport is an approach for taking two datasets, and computing a mapping between them in the form of a "transport plan" γ.
 We now have a paradox of choice; for a given budget, it is not obvious which cheap alternatives to use for our student network, nor where to place them.
 Datasets in these regimes are, in practice, quite different from those typically used in machine learning research (which are usually geared towards content that can be easily curated by lay people).
 While existing methods based on weaklysupervised learning demonstrate empirical gains, there is no existing formalism for describing the theoretical guarantees conferred by different forms of weak supervision (Kulkarni et al., 2015; Reed et al., 2015; Bouchacourt et al., 2018).
A core component in (theoretical or empirical) analysis of generalization is the notion of complexity measure; a quantity that monotonically relates to some aspect of generalization.
 Moreover, extensions of these algorithms can be used for verifying properties beyond robustness, such as rotation or shift invariant (Singh et al., 2019), conservation of energy (Qin et al., 2019) and model correctness (Yang & Rinard, 2019).
On the other hand, several researchers have suggested theoretical permutation equivariant models and proved they are equivariant universal.
 Motivated to better balance the available system resources (computation vs. communication), local SGD (a.k.a. local-update SGD, parallel SGD, or federated averaging) has recently attracted increased research interest (Mcdonald et al., 2009; Zinkevich et al., 2010; McDonald et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2014; 2016; McMahan et al., 2017).
 (1)The mapping G is typically approximated by a neural network Gθ parametrized by θ.
 Second, GDA exhibits strong rotation around fixed points, which requires using very small learning rates (Mescheder et al., 2017; Balduzzi et al., 2018) to converge.
 Regularization and replay approaches address the catastrophic forgetting by regularizing the update of a specific set of weights or replaying the previously seen data, respectively.
 Hence, are structural representations in general —and GNNs in particular— fundamentally incapable of performing link (dyadic) and multi-ary (polyadic) predictions tasks? GNNs, however, can perform node classification tasks, which is a task not associated with positional node embeddings (see Appendix (Section 7) for a concrete visual interpretation of the differences between positional node embeddings and structural representations over node classification and link prediction tasks).
Calibration is crucial in high-stakes scenarios such as drug-target discovery from biological networks, where end-users need trustworthy and interpretable decisions.
 One might argue that people with less ratings do not like movies in general and it is natural to give higher predicted values to people with more ratings.
 Over-smoothing, towards the other extreme, makes training a very deep GCN difficult.
 In addition, existing methods such as DRIT (Lee et al., (2018)) cannot acquire the desired results for both image translation preserving the shape (e.g, horse2zebra) and∗corresponding authorimage translation changing the shape (e.g, cat2dog) with the fixed network architecture and hyperparameters.
 However, as models increase in size, so do their training and inference times.
 To do this, we rely on a basic assumption of the multi-view literature – that each view provides the same task-relevant information (Zhao et al., 2017).
 In this work, we propose to explore∗Equal contribution.
 A known fact is that differential privacy implies stability (Kasiviswanathan et al., 2011).
 In the optimization literature, such problems are studied under the class of task scheduling, which is known to be NP-hard in typical settings (Sinnen, 2007; Kwok & Ahmad, 1999).
 Learning about mapping, state-estimation and path-planning purely from data in an end-to-end manner can be prohibitively expensive.
 Adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., (2014)), defensive distillation (Papernot et al., (2015)) and input gradient regularization (Ross & Doshi-Velez (2017)) are a few representative defense techniques.
 In particular in (Lenssen et al., 2018) the group theoretical connection is made explicit with equivariant capsules that provide a sparse index/value representation of feature maps on groups (Gens & Domingos, 2014).
Our main contributions are:
 In particular, we drop entire layers to extract shallow models at inference time.
 By involving only a pair of languages, we can study  most of this work was done while the author interned at the University of Pennsylvania.mdthe performance on a given target language, ensuring that it is influenced only by the cross-lingual transfer from the source language, without having to worry about a third language interfering.
 However, since each component corresponds to a full-scale image, important physical features of objects like position and scale are only implicitly encoded in the scale of a full image and further disentanglement is required to extract these useful features.
For the last couple of decades, different communities such as machine learning 16; 33; 10; 40; 14, physics 29; 38; 35, and computer science 42; 43 independently from mathematics community 32; 25; 12; 6 developed novel graph representation techniques.
 Such data scarcity problem among long-tail relations poses tough challenge for purely data-driven methods.
 This is particularly critical in applications with both short and long-term dynamics and it is generally addressed, for instance in robust MPC (Richards, 2004; Raković et al., 2012), by using a controller to pre-stabilise the predictions.
For the evaluation of our algorithm we in particular focus on the generalization performance (on the test-set) on standard machine learning benchmarks, hereby departing from previous work such as e.g, (Tang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2019; Reisizadeh et al., 2019) that mostly considered training performance (on the train-set).
 Recently, (Uesato et al., 2018) studied the problem of adversarial testing for continuous control domains in a similar but slightly different setting.
 More recently, Bello et al., (2019) augmented CNNs by replacing some convolutional layers with self-attention layers, leading to improvements on image classification and object detection tasks.
 As a consequence, policy-aware methods are difficult to apply when off-policy data are pre-generated by multiple behavior policies or when the behavior policy’s form is unknown.
 The outer cevolutionary search is attempting to find a programfor the curiosity module, so as to optimize the agent lifetime return T t=0 rt, or another global objective like the mean performance on the last few trials.
 Our approach is able to solve tasks where standard methods run for billions of steps without seeing a single non-zero reward.
 The transductive setting, as an alternative, has the advantage of being able to see partial or all points in xt before making predictions.
 If a generative classifier is able to perform well on all of these, it will naturally be robust to noisy, ambiguous or adversarially perturbed inputs.
 A fully supervised scheme (e.g, deep encoders) may be trained to recover the class and content information from a single image.
 However, an open question remains: how to choose the dimensionality and curvatures of each of the partial spaces?A popular approach to generative modeling is the Variational Autoencoder (Kingma & Welling, 2014).
 This paper proposes a simple method for improving the sample efficiency of policy gradient methods such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) for black-box optimization by using surrogate models that are trained online to approximate f(x).
 One class of methods trains a white-box substitute model and attacks the target model with adversarial examples that successfully fool the substitute (Papernot et al., 2017).
 We argue that real-world tasks often have a hierarchical structure and multiple goals, which require long horizon planning or reasoning ability (Erol, 1996; Xu et al., 2017; Ghazanfari & Taylor, 2017; Sohn et al., 2018).
 Subsequently, we feed the autoencoder reconstructed input to the autoencoder to calculate another set of activation values in the hidden layers.
Point cloud processing is of particular interest under this perspective.
 Since language fluency is determined by the ordering of words and sentences, finding the best permutation of a set of words and sentences is an essential problem in many NLP tasks, such as machine translation and NLU (Hasler et al., 2017).
 This idea is materialized in our work in two complementary ways: Firstly, we use an attention matching strategy so that the real-valued network can more* Denotes equal contributionclosely guide the binary network during optimization.
Motivation.
 Howard et al., (2019); Tan & Le (2019b) adopts Inverted Residuals with Linear Bottlenecks (MobileNetV2 block) (Sandler et al., 2018), a building block with light-weighted depth-wise convolutions for highly efficient networks in mobile scenarios.
 A growing set of recent works have demonstrated promising empirical performance in unsupervised representation learning via MI maximization (Krause et al., 2010; Huet al., 2017; Alemi et al., 2018b; Oord et al., 2018; Hjelm et al., 2019).
 A straightforward way to reduce the computation of the transformer is to shrink the embedding size directly.
We can also think of understanding the representational cost as asking an approximation theory question: what functions can we represent, or approximate, with our de facto model class, namely the class of functions representable with small magnitude weights? There has been much celebrated work studying approximation in terms of the network size, i.g,, asking how many units are necessary in order to approximate a target function (Hornik et al., 1989; Cybenko, 1989; Barron, 1993; Pinkus, 1999).
 Using an iterative method based on power iteration, it approximates the adversarial direction corresponding to certain input points.
 For example, it enables a robot to keep on learning new tasks via natural language instruction, a conversational agent to adapt to new conversation topics quickly, and a neural machine translation system to expand its vocabulary continually.
 However, the demonstration from the fast robot should still be useful because it shows the path to go through the maze.
 With the power of big data, deep neural networks that learn data-driven features to segment shape parts, such as (Kalogerakis et al., 2010; Graham et al., 2018; Mo et al., 2019b), have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance on many shape segmentation benchmarks (Yi et al., 2016; Mo et al., 2019b).
 However, these attacks are limited to datasets like MNIST, CIFAR and CelebA, and are usually unable to scale up to bigger and more complex datasets such as ImageNet.
 For regularization, Gulrajani et al., (2017) penalize the gradient norm of straight lines between real data and generated data.
 Introducing the propagation-discovery model, SQAIR can also handle dynamic scenes where objects may disappear or be introduced in the middle of a sequence.
 Existing defense strategies aim to either detect stealing query patterns (Juuti et al., 2019), or degrade quality of predicted posterior via perturbation.
 In this work, we set out to develop a principled probabilistic deep learning approach capable of coping with uncertain orientations.
 Interestingly, however, if an ordinary CNN happens to learn rotated copies of the same filter, the stack of feature maps becomes equivariant to rotations even though individual feature maps are not (Cohen & Welling, 2016).
 Compared to STE based methods, stochastic methods suffer from large gradient variance, which makes training of large quantized DNNs difficult.
 Our approach rests on the insight that the signal-to-noise ratio in negative sampling is poor since there is no association between input features and their artificial labels.
 NAS-Bench-101 enabled a comprehensive benchmarking of many discrete NAS optimizers (Zoph & Le, 2017; Real et al., 2019), using the exact same settings.
 In order to improve data efficiency, all ensembles are typically trained using the same data (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017), resulting in a method which does not have a theoretical justification.
 Miller & Hardt (2019) tried to explain why feed-forward neural networks are competitive with recurrent networks in practice.
 Training new DL systems based on these stolen details still provides the benefits, even when the training data is different.
 In conversion, we train an ANN with ReLU neurons using gradient descent and then convert the ANN to an SNN with IF neurons by using suitable threshold balancing (Sengupta et al., 2019).
 We do this by adding adversarial perturbations to images that are large in the `p norm (larger than the used by the certificate generator), and produce attack images that are surrounded by a large ball exclusively containing images of the same label.
 MILk also outperforms hard monotonic attention and MoChA; while the other two monotonic attention mechanisms only consider a fixed window, MILk computes a softmax attention over all previous encoder states, which may be the key to its improved latency-quality tradeoffs.
 More importantly, we design a novel linear model that accounts for both gradientand activation-based features.
 During fine-tuning on the target dataset, the regularization constrains the search space around this starting point, which in turn prevents overfitting the target dataset.
 In recent years, deep learning (LeCun et al., 2015) methods have achieved remarkable successes.
 These studies posed a question about the current architecture and made us aware of the need for the theoretical analysis of the graph NN expressive power.
 These methods have been shown achieving state-of-the-art results on a variety of different prediction tasks Kipf et al., (2018); Xie & Grossman (2018); Gilmer et al., (2017); Chen et al., (2019a).
The code can be found at https://github.com/tongwu2020/phattacks.
 Several techniques have been proposed to improve the transferability of black-box attacks crafted on a surrogate model, such as momentum boosting (Dong et al., 2018), diverse input (Xie et al., 2019) and translation invariance (Dong et al., 2019).
 In addition, because of the high cost of annotation, the content of one bilingual parallel sentence pair is only represented by a single image, which is weak in capturing the diversity of visual information.
 As a result, understanding and addressing the domain shift problem for few-shot classification is of great interest.
 We note that the term “synaptic weights” refers to the strength of a connection between two nodes.
 It is clear that demographic parity will cripple the utility if the demographic group membership and the target variable are indeed correlated.
 In a modern warehouse, the process of storage assignment usually involves forklift drivers moving inbound pallets from thestaging area of the warehouse to the storage location, so a sub-optimal assignment system causes unnecessary long travel times to store the pallet.
 To state the connection between GNNs and this test, consider the simple GNN architecture that updates the feature vector of each graph node by combining it with the aggregation of the feature vectors of its neighbors.
In this work, we study the dependence of the entire optimization trajectory on the early phase of training.
 Another routine is object-based and mediated by high-level expectations about the shape and structure of perceptual objects
 The purpose of network deconvolution is to remove the correlation effects via: x = K−1b, assuming K is an invertible matrix.
∗Equal Contribution.
 Todor created the manipulation tasks in the transfer suite, helped Yi with the RND baseline, and prepared code for open-sourcing.
 (2) After a good architecture is selected, various strategies can be employed to train this architecture and report the performance, e.g, different data augmentation (Ghiasi et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018), different regularization (Zoph et al., 2018), different scheduler (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017), and different selections of hyper-parameters (Liu et al., 2018; Dong & Yang, 2019a).
 Several key studies (Xu et al., 2017; Ching et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019) have shown that successful transfer learning is not only a∗Equal contribution.
 Since one can choose any knowledge to carry on the conversation, there can be one-to-many relations between dialogue context and knowledge selection.
 There is a wide range of AFs available in the literature which are designed to yield universal optimization strategies and therefore come with minimal assumptions about the class of target objective functions.
In classical computing, information is stored in bits – a single bit represents an element from the set B = {0, 1}, it can be in one of two possible states.
 Thus, the rule can be treated as a noisy generalization of those exemplars.
In this paper, we propose to resolve this restriction by using embeddings associated with the directions to neighboring atoms, i.g,by embedding atoms as a set of messages.
 This can not be well explained by a classical VC-dimension type theory (Harvey et al., 2017) which suggests that overparameterized models cause overfitting and thus result in poor generalization ability.
 The basic idea behind such training is that when a device finishes calculating its batch gradients, an update to the DNN parameters is immediately performed, without waiting for other devices.
 Here, we show that in the special case of Gaussian latent space distributions, the intrinsic problem dimension can be discovered.
 ∗These authors contributed equally.
 While this has been a standard practice for model compression (Han et al., 2015), some recent efforts start empirically linking it to the potential of more efficient training.
 Following a line of previous work, such as Swirszcz et al., (2016), Zhang et al., (2016), Balduzzi et al., (2017) and Santurkar et al., (2018), we put the assumptions and conclusions of deep learning theory to the test using experiments with both toy networks and realistic ones.
 Following this trend, current state-of-the-art encoders such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) are also trained with variants of the language modeling objective: masked language modeling and permutation language modeling.

 Given such data, we still wish to estimate a stationary quantity.
1 In comparison with SGD and its variants, FedAvg performs more local computation and less communication.
 Zuchao Li and Zhuosheng Zhang were internship research fellows at NICT when conducting this work.
 Branching strategies decide how the search space is recursively split into smaller spaces.
 Examples include the LSTM, the GRU (Chung et al., 2015), and even designs by Neural Architecture Search (Zoph and Le 2016).
 While EBMs are currently challenging to work with, they fit more naturally within a discriminative framework than other generative models and facilitate the use of modern classifier architectures.
 In addition, states and actions may also contain latent features (e.g, similar states could have similar optimal actions).
Optimization Landscapes: we show that the optimization landscape induced by modern policy gradient algorithms is often not reflective of the underlying true reward landscape, and that the latter is frequently poorly behaved in the relevant sample regime.
 These algorithms are closely related: PPO was originally developed as a refinement of TRPO.
 Thus, to optimally leverage meta-learning under various imbalances, it would be beneficial for the model to task- and class-adaptively decide how much to use from the meta-learner, and how much to learn specifically for each task and class.
Research on computational prediction of RNA secondary structure from knowledge of primary structure has been carried out for decades.
Our contributions are three-fold.
 Activations for 64K tokens with embedding size 1024 and batch size 8 account for 64K × 1K × 8 = 0.5B floats, requiring another 2GB of memory.
We formulate here the problem of automated discovery of a diverse set of self-organized patterns in such high-dimensional, complex dynamical systems.
 Current attribution methods cannot guarantee that the network is ignroing the low-scored locomotive for the prediction.
 It does this by using vector-valued activations, termed ’capsules’.
 However, their application to audio generation tasks has seen relatively limited success so far.
 As such, NPs would ideally have translation equivariance built directly into the modelling assumptions as an inductive bias.
 We show that it is possible to train more accurate and provably robust neural networks using the same convex relaxations as those used in existing, state-of-the-art provable defense methods, but with a new, different optimization procedure inspired by adversarial training.
 This issue arises due to the permutation invariance of neural network (NN) parameters, i.g,for∗Work performed while doing an internship at IBM Research.
Toward addressing the generalization problem with learned priors, we follow the intuition that: (1) each trajectory in a video game or a robotics task is composed of state-action pairs with object interactions (2) terminal rewards can be approximated by the aggregation of the scores for each state-action pairs.
 Both de-mixing tasks require probabilistic reasoning to interpret noisy and uncertain data, while satisfying a set of rules: Sudoku rules and thermodynamic rules, respectively.
 However, it is extremely expensive to scan all the inner functions (for both SGD and GD) as well as all the outer functions (for GD) in each iteration.
 Li et al., (2018) showed that under certain assumptions, the decision boundaries of the last fully connected layer of DNNs will converge to a linear SVM.
 If the task requires navigation, the hidden state will naturally be required to store spatially structured information.
 This is due to inadequate characterizations of the semantics of the inputs and the adversarial examples — Song et al., (2018) and Zhao et al., (2018b) confine the distribution of the latents of the adversarial examples to a Gaussian.
 For example, knowledge distilling from auxiliary models is popular for heuristically designing weighting schemes.
Driven by the success of such techniques and the efficient use of GPUs, considerable research effort has been devoted to finding ways of training deeper and wider networks with larger capacity (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014; He et al., 2016; Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016).
 In this work we focus on biased estimators.
 The key idea is to allow nodes at i, i+X, i+ 2X... (i=0,1,2…) layers of the tree to share the same projection vector for partitioning.
 Nonetheless, it has been known in the literature that MLP architectures, due to their huge complexity, do not usually admit efficient training and generalization for networks of more than a few layers.
 Such locally interpretable models are very useful for real-world AI deployments to provide succinct and human-like explanations to users.
Accurately quantifying the value of data has a great potential for improving model performance for real-world training datasets which commonly contain incorrect labels, and where the input samples differ in relatedness, sample quality, and usefulness for the target task.
 That is to say, nowadays, it is still inconvenient to users that have to choose the appropriate methods for specific domains.
 Nevertheless, anchors can be regarded as a feature-sharing sliding window scheme to cover the possible locations of objects.
 Driven by the significance of depth, the residual block consisted of residual mapping and shortcut was raised in ResNet (He et al., 2016).
 The existing literature on the optimization also refers to θ as the primal variable and δi’s as the dual variables.
 First, with proper selection of the audio priors, we show that DAP generalizes well to a wide variety of unseen types of data.
 A toy example is given in fig.  1(a).
 Thirdly, the policy of controlling states of interest can be quickly adapted to unknown tasks.
 Although real-world recommendation systems are usually updated in an online manner with the assist of increasing observed user behavior Rendle & Schmidt-Thieme (2008); Agarwal et al., (2010); He et al., (2016), introducing a feedback mechanism during their training phases can potentially improve the efficiency of the initial systems.
 In this paper, we study the properties of the coefficient matrix H(t), which governs the dynamics of the gradient descent.
 Several works have demonstrated that DNNs can in fact benefit from such augmentation (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2016; Goodfellow et al., 2015).
 Knowing that DNNs are easily susceptible to simple attacks can hinder the public confidence in them, especially for real-world deployment, e.g, in self-driving cars and devices for the visually impaired.
 Our main findings are:
 For another thing, there no exit practical auxiliary frameworks that are capable to promote the mature structure of SNNs, which leads to the consequence of few application and rare forward-step development of SNNs.
Consider the class of 2-layer ReLU neural networks f : Rd → R parameterized by (W, c) ∈ Rm×d × Rm asf(x; W, c) = 1√ m m∑ k=1 ckσ(w > k x).(1.1)Here the activation function is the ReLU, σ(s) = max{s, 0} 26, m denotes the width of the second layer, and f is normalized accordingly by a factor √ m.
 However, GraphSAGE has its own faults.
 Third, although they give reasonable compression and computation reduction, their accuracy is not sufficient compared to that of standard-convolution-based models.
 For this reason, we often refer to φ as the parameters of an inference network.
 By permanently pruning a number of channels, the computation and storage cost of CNNs can be dramatically reduced when being deployed, and the inference execution can be accelerated consequently.
 Then, in the second stage, an auxiliary network is trained using the segmentation network model trained in the previous stage and the labeled data to generate the confidence map.
 This nested structure is then decomposed into a series of linear and nonlinear equality constraints by introducing auxiliary variables and penalty hyperparameters.
 Instead, we learn to represent skeletons by a neural network and at test time, we sample the closest appropriate skeleton the network has seen at training.
 A spectrogram is a compact 2D representation of audio signals in terms of its frequency spectrum over time.
 Prototypical learning decomposes decision making into known samples (see fig.  1), referred here as prototypes.
Nomenclature Registration is the problem of estimating the relative geometric differences between two images (e.g, due to shifts, rotations, deformations).
 This makes such approaches impractical due to the significant amount of compute required for the policy search itself, at times offsetting gains made by the reduced step time.
 For sufficiently large k, kdimensional WL algorithm includes all combinatorial properties of a graph (Cai et al., (1992a)), so one may hope its power is enough for the data set at hand.
 The exact reason why it expedites training and helps generalization, however, remains mysterious and is actively studied in recent years (Bjorck et al., 2018; Santurkar et al., 2018; Kohler et al., 2019).
 For example the SGLD sampler (Welling & Teh, 2011) amounts to performing stochastic gradient descent while adding Gaussian noise to each parameter update.
To explain the effectiveness of distillation, Hinton et al., (2015) suggested that instead of the hard labels (i.
Inducing-point methods (Quiñonero-Candela & Rasmussen, 2005; Titsias, 2009; Hensman et al., 2013; 2015) define variational distributions on a small numberM of inducing points and then derive the distribution of non-inducing points conditioned on these inducing points.
In this work we re-examine the problem of post-processing word vectors as a shrinkage estimation of the true/underlying oracle gram matrix of words, which is a rank-deficient matrix due to the existence of synonyms and antonyms.
Unfortunately, there are obstacles to applying multi-view constraints directly to deep learning.
 This does not necessarily make the distributions of the features in the same layer to become similar.
 Both Kohler & Lucchi (2017b) and Xu et al., (2017) propose to directly subsample the gradient and Hessian in the cubic surrogate function, and achieve Õ(1/ 3.5) and Õ(1/ 2.5) stochastic first- and second-order oracle complexities respectively.
 Moreover, knowledge transfer may happen across timesteps.
 Furthermore, the final model performance is quite sensitive to the value of the maximum learning rate and the number of warm-up iterations.
 In fact, from the perspective of loss landscape, (Santurkar et al., 2018) demonstrates BatchNorm will make the optimization landscape smoother, and then this smoothness induces a more predictive and stable behavior of the gradients.
 Recently, Xie et al., (2017) introduced a sensible way to approximate the conditional entropy (Figure 1-(a)), which uses probabilistic attribute classifier qφ, where φ represents the parameter of the classifier, to approximate the conditional probability distribution p(a|z).
 These source agents interacting with one of the environment instances provide their deterministic policy to a new target agent in another environment instance.
 While we focus on 2D data in the following to make comparisons with existing techniques from imaging applications possible, our approach naturally extends to higher dimensions.
 The I/O of the auxiliary module is defined independently from the GNN to which it is attached, and the users can install the GWM just by adding a small segment of code.
 Second, when optimizing the parameters (the weights) of the network, when points are already mapped close together, it may be difficult to find gradient directions that effectively separate nearby images.
 Such methods, however, rely on explicit supervision for optimizing the grounding or attention modules (Liu et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2019) and require bounding box annotations for each visually groundable word.
 We use spectral methods, which leverages the highly efficient Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm for enforcing such constraints.
 (a) Existing sensitivity bounds (Phan et al., 2016; 2017b;a) and designs (Yu et al., 2019; Lee & Kifer, 2018) have not been developed to protect the training data in adversarial training.
 In this paper, we address the following research question: can we learn to prune edges of a proximity graph while still being accurate to find nearest neighbors? Specifically, the pruned proximity graph should be more efficient than the state-of-the-art proximity graphs with comparable accuracy.
 The input sequence, in principle, can be infinite.
 For their method, a CNN is applied to extract visual features from the input images and then every row is encoded using a recurrent neural network (RNN).
 Such problems cover a range of important applications among AI research, e.g, navigation, robotics control and video game playing.
 We will show that AutoGrow generalizes to different datasets and layer architectures.
Automating the architecture design process via neural architecture search (NAS) has attracted increasing attention in recent years.
 From this heatmap, we gather the parameters of the top-K local maxima, and then extract the corresponding collection of image patches via an image sampling process.
 Remarkably, using the Gaussian mechanism for randomized smoothing, Cohen et al., (2019) successfully certify 49% accuracy on the original ImageNet dataset under adversarial perturbations with `2 norm less than 0.5.
Specifically, based on the general min-max framework, we show that these problems can be solved under the same optimization procedure and prove the rate of its algorithmic convergence.
 On the other hand, a learning algorithm biasing towards old tasks will interfere with the learning of the new task.
 In A-GEM, a small episodic memory is utilized to store a random subset of the examples from old tasks.
 In particular, to the best of our knowledge, a joint convolution across the space and the scaling group S has yet been proposed to achieve equivariance in the most general form.
 MaskConvNet provides elegant support for training budget-aware pruned networks from scratch, by adding a simple mask module to each bundled block of the target ConvNets.fig. 1 showcases an example of applying MaskConvNet to a typical bundled block Conv/BN/ReLU for filter pruning.
 Some other methods (Kwon & Murphy, 2000; Yang et al., 2013) further use additional manually extracted external features, but they fail to automatically extract the spatial representation of OD data.
 In this paper, we try to improve the sample efficiency in RL from the perspective of representation learning using the celebrated information bottleneck framework (Tishby et al., 2000).
 Obtaining high degree of sparsity in such as setting will be difficult as dropping any of the neurons will result in information loss.
 Even worse, k-means is highly sensitive to the initial centroids, which usually are randomly initialized.
 In order to take full advantage of the available labeled data, a conditioning method for CNF – which models the conditional likelihood, as well as the posterior, of the data and the labels – is needed.
 The specific form of our generalization gap suggests that meta-learning models can be implicitly regularized by constructing them to express each datapoint with a small number of bits.
 First, the compression rate is significant.
 We revise the goal as d(Dreal,Dg) = 0, with a distribution distance d(·, ·).
 The mask is defined as one or multiple pieces of text fragments from the input text.
 However, the key words or phrases of case3 are scattered.
 So the GAN is just like a game between these two players.
 Kidziński & Hastie (2018) proposed a framework which formulates the problem as a matrix completion problem and solve it using matrix factorization techniques.
 This has several advantages:
 A number of important challenges need to be solved, however, and some of them were elegantly expressed by Francis Crick who argued that the error-backpropagation rule is neurobiologically unrealistic (Crick, 1989).
We construct environments where the dynamics are simply piecewise linear functions with constant pieces, but the optimal Q-functions and the optimal policy require an exponential (in the horizon)* indicates equal contributionFigure 1: Left: The dynamics of two randomly generated MDPs (from the RAND, and SEMI-RAND methods outlined in Section 4.3 and detailed in Appendix D.1).
 So, depending on the latent vector z, a single input IAi ∈ A can be mapped to multiple outputs in B.
 However, softmax is strictly dense, i.g,, it devotes some attention probability mass to every region of the image.
 Unsupervised learning on the other hand is a self-learning mechanism where the natural structure present within a set of data points is inferred.
 (C2) When generating adversarial examples against ASR, existing approaches do not consider the inherent voice data property, which allows defense mechanisms (Yang et al., (2018)) that exploit voice data properties to resist such attacks.
For example, while training image datasets such as Cifar-10 and ImageNet with SGD or Momentum, a staircase schedule with high starting learning rate typically performs best.
 Huang et al., (2018) further improved FastGCN by using an adaptive sampling technique to reduce the variance of estimators.
Many modern online applications (e.g, UI Layout) have configuration involving multivariate dimensions to be optimized, such as font size, background color, title text, module location, item image etc., each dimension contains multiple options Hill et al., (2017) Nair et al., (2018).
 Regularizations are imposed among sub-networks to encourage common semantics across domains.
 To circumvent the need for specific domain knowledge in data augmentation, more recent work Antoniou et al., (2017) utilizes generative adversarial networks(GANs) Goodfellow et al., (2014) to produce images that better encode features in the latent space of training data.
 In sucha setting, effective models have to infer event locations more accurately than the labels they relied on for training.
 Spectral methods typically first compute the graph Laplacian, then perform filtering in the spectral domain (Bruna et al., 2013).
This naı̈ve aggregation method will often fail as not all source domains are equally important when transferring to a specific target domain.
Often, for languages for which large amounts of data is not available, aforementioned techniques for creating embeddings (static or contextualized) is not possible and additional strategies need to be employed.
The extension of min-max optimization from the FO domain to the gradient-free regime is challenging since the solver suffers from uncertainties in both black-box objective functions and optimization procedure and do not scale well to high-dimensional problems.
 We take advantage of the over-parametrization of neural networks by using an activation based neural pruning scheme to train models which only use a fraction of their width.
 BERT model uses an embedding size of 1024 (Devlin et al., 2018); GPT-2 uses models with embedding size up to 1600 (Radford et al., 2019).
 The system can be used for prosody transfer between speakers (“say it like this”), but does not work for transfer between unrelated sentences, and does not preserve the pitch range of the target speaker.
 The probability of selecting model predicted token is gradually increased as training progresses.
 This operation requires the explicit knowledge whether an input word is male or female; we have to add a difference vector to a male word and subtract it from a female word for a gender transfer.
 On the other hand, the mini-batch gradient norms for BERT take a wide range of values and are sometimes much larger than their mean value.
 The success of machine learning in this domain has been enormously helpful as a process that was often painstakingly slow has been rapidly accelerated in searching an unimaginably large space of possible drug compounds, estimate to be up to 1060 (Polishchuk et al., 2013).
 KD aims to transfer the knowledge embedded in a large teacher network to a small student network.
 Alternatively, Bayesian optimization with a Gaussian process model is a leading method for zeroth order optimization of expensive-to-evaluate functions, which is precisely the setting of deep learning model selection.
 In this work, we relax the restriction of fixing the network architecture and allow the number of channels of the CNN under consideration to vary.
 This representation can then be extracted either by directly inverting the generative process (Srivastava et al., 2019b) or by extracting intermediate representations of the model itself (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Higgins et al., 2017).
 While being mathematically clear and well defined, normalizing flows keep the dimensionality of the original data in order to maintain bijectivity.
 This has several valuable applications: (1) Synthesised vivid motion for animation production without excessive human labor.
 In particular, after image sampling using a pooling operation, even the 3*3 convolution kernel has the ability to extract context information.
 Given parallel data, such as sentences, a joint model learns to predict either the word or context in bothsource and target languages.
 Besides these, it is possible to consider other viewpoints, such as edge number, graph diameter, and the total number of nodes in a dataset.
 However, this information is not always provided, especially in deep learning models.
 In these approaches, weight-sharing is the key for the speedup.
 Future research on GANs would be much easier if we could have the gains from large batches without these pain points.
 One of the essential questions is why is it ConvNet? or in more practical perspective, to explain what is “priors in DIP” with simple and clear words (like smoothness, sparseness, low-rank etc) is very important.
 The former phase aims to iteratively update vector representation of each node by recursively aggregating representations of its neighbors, and then the latter phase applies a pooling function (e.g, mean, max or sum pooling) on output node representations to produce an embedding of each entire graph; and this graph embedding is used to predict the graph label.
 Furthermore, group sparsity regularization (Yuan & Lin, 2006) has also been applied to neural networks, such as finding optimal number of neuron groups (Alvarez & Salzmann, 2016) and exerting good data locality with structured sparsity (Wen et al., 2016; Yoon & Hwang, 2017).
 Furthermore, some of the found architectures by NAS have much more parameters than manually designed ones on the same dataset.
 This discrepancy is formalized with the notion of the fraction of variance explained Vex (Kvålseth, 1985).
 For example, in Amharic, an orthographic word combines some syntactic words into one compact string.
 In other examples, clinicians set treatment goals for the patients, i.g,, they take actions to make the patient measurements reach some pre-determined values.
 In the multi-head scenario, the task identifier i is known at test time.
 The principle is that when a radioactive positron nucleus decays, a proton in the nucleus is converted into a neutron, and a positron and a neutron are released.
 For example, MolGAN (De Cao & Kipf, 2018) has a relatively simple decoder but suffers from generating numerous duplicated graph samples.
 In other words, a quantization approach can further reduce the number of bits by compromising the increase in number of channels, or the increase in number of computations.
 Denoting by wkij the weights ij of layer k, we are interested in the quantities:‖yl‖2, ‖Jk‖2 = ∑ ij ‖ ∂y L ∂wkij ‖2 (1)representing the norm of the activations of layer l and Jacobian with respect to layer k.
 Furthermore, modeling stochastic activations through noise is often practically useful for improving exploration and local minima escape during optimization, generalization and adversarial robustness (You et al., 2018; Noh et al., 2017; Bishop, 1995; Gulcehre et al., 2016), and in some cases can be linked back to Bayesian models of weights (Noh et al., 2017; Gal & Ghahramani, 2016) when the noise added at each activation can be considered as a result of different samples from the weight posterior.
 pragmatic aspects, equally need to be taken into account.
Ben-David et al., (2010) suggests that target error can be minimized by bounding the error of a model on the source data, the discrepancy between distributions of the two domains, and a small optimal joint error.
 Moreover, f can be chosen to retain fine-grained structure of xt, for example by modeling it through diffeomorphic warps of xt, as is done in deep registration approaches (Yang et al., 2017; Dalca et al., 2018).
 No single algorithm can perform consistently well in a wide range of scenarios, since it has been tailored to a specific model.
 In the case of `2-norm attacks, the adversary can perturb as many coordinates of the input vector as they choose as long as the `2-norm of the perturbation vector is bounded.
 Such similarity metrics are either defined a priori or learned from the data to specifically solve classification tasks via a Siamese network architecture (Chopra et al., 2005).
 Recently, some studies have shown that rather than using a pretrained teacher, simultaneously training networks to learn from each other in a peer-teaching manner is also possible.
In this work, we start from a new perspective and consider the performance of deep classification models with a new metric Cross Category Kullback-Leibler divergence (CCKL), namely the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between the model’s output distributions over input data from different categories, instead of the traditional metric of accuracy.
In this paper, we propose Generalized Domain Adaptation (GDA), a more challenging but practical domain adaptation setting where the conditional Shift in Feature Distribution and Shift in Label Distribution are required to be minimized simultaneously.
 These requirements normally limit a wide application of these models as out-of-the box tools.
 The above elicitation approach has two main caveats that limited its application:• When the outcome space |Ω| is large and is even possibly infinite, it is practically impossible for any human agents to report such a distribution with reasonable efforts.
 Such privacy guarantee provides strong protection against potential adversaries (Hitaj et al., 2017; Rahman et al., 2018).
 There are several approaches for achieving this, most common are Bayesian neural networks (Gal, 2016; Gal & Ghahramani, 2016), ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) and outputting a parametric distribution directly (Nix & Weigend, 1994).
 In particular, a relevant difference in the training and evaluation procedures exists between available publications.
Learning from observational data already presents significant challenges in the binary treatment setting.
 Often, the documentation miss details which make the results not reproducible.
One interesting mix of few-shot learning with additional large-scale data is the work of Douze et al., (2018), where labels are propagated from few clean labeled examples to a large-scale collection.
 However, it is not sound to apply SMD to policy optimization directly, and the challenges are two-fold: (I) The objective of policy-based RL is a typical non-convex function, but Ghadimi et al., (2016) show that it may cause instability and even divergence when updating the parameter of a non-convex objective function by SMD via a single batch sample.
 This claim has been highly debated as subsequent research has linked the compression phase to saturation of neurons (Saxe et al., 2018) or clustering of the hidden representations (Goldfeld et al., 2019).
Existing techniques do not efficiently train user embeddings in FL since the standard Federated Averaging algorithm (McMahan et al., 2016) transfers and averages all parameters on a central server.
 However, domain randomization has been empirically shown to often lead to suboptimal policies with high variance in performance over different randomizations (Mehta et al., 2019).
 The inner maximization problem is to find an adversarial example xi, within the -ball around a given normal example x0i that maximizes the classification loss `.
 First, in most super resolution methods, lowresolution(LR) images are simply downsampled from the high-resolution image with a fixed known method, for example bicubic interpolation.
 For the original image, the saliency map shows that the classifier focuses on the four (and a couple of random pixels on the left).
 The fusion in inference process provides a rich multi-level information.
 Hyperparameter tuning is arguably one of the most time consuming parts of training DNNs, and researchers often resort to a costly grid search.
Therefore, this paper proposes a new PC layer formulated by non-parametric and extremely fast conventional transforms.
 The typical goal of AL is to to select, from a large unlabeled dataset, the smallest possible training set to label in order to solve a specific task (Cohn et al., 1994).
 The only assumption about the input data form is that the learned representations should incorporate the underlying data structures along some certain dimensions.
 Multi-labels prediction setting, however, restricts the capacity of existing advanced metric learning techniques like the popular LMNN Weinberger & Saul (2009), as different classes can range from a few to hundred different labels, but the appropriate distance metric could not be provided.
 In traditional GAN generators, the stochastic component that influences individual samples is a noisy input vector, typically sampled from the standard Gaussian distribution.
 In this field, generative adversarial networks (GANs) by Goodfellow et al., (2014) have attracted substantial interest, particularly due to their success in generating photorealistic images (Karras et al., 2017).
 However, due to the constraint of sequential computation over time, the training of RNN cannot be parallelized and thus is usually time-consuming.
 These methods can provide guidance on how to take actions, even for those states are not seen in the demonstrations.
 It exploits the inherent multi-scale, pyramidal hierarchy of deep convolutional networks to construct feature pyramids with marginal extra cost.
 Consequently, even though representation space is constrained compared with quantization methods based on look-up tables, various inference accelerators can be designed to exploit advantages of binary codes (Rastegari et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2018).
 More recently, gradient-based frameworks enabled efficient solutions by introducing a continuous relaxation of the search space.
However, another property of the softmax, which is less discussed, is that the outputs are normalized in order to obtain a probability distribution.
 Recursive approaches suffer from poor long-term performance (Lamb et al., 2016; Fox et al., 2018) as errors are amplified in feedback loops.
 For instance, Filippi et al., (2010) makes a generalized linear model assumption on the reward, Bubeck et al., (2011) require it to have a Lipschitz continuous property in a proper metric space, and Valko et al., (2013) assume the reward function belongs to some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).
 Clearly, it could take a long time to sufficiently test a DL model.
 There has also been some success in combining aspects of both approaches for certain tasks, such as (Isola et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2017b; Park et al., 2019).
 In the past few years, many researchers have developed a lot of meaningful work in this direction, such as 3D modeling and synthesis Carlson (1982); Van Kaick et al., (2011).
 Moreover, considering the fact that summarization is not an easy task even for people, reliable human-labeled data are also difficult to obtain.
 On the other hand, training and storing separate models, including generative models for generative rehearsal, comes at increased memory cost and doesn’t allow for full knowledge sharing, particularly to already stored models.
 Moreover, Locatello et al., (2018) found that as regularization strength increases, the total correlation of sampled representation TCsample and mean representation TCmean are actually negatively correlated.
However, in practice, semi-supervised generative approaches often encounter three major challenges: (1) The two-stage training process is not robust.
 We show that, in conjunction with binning, simple uncertainty statistics outperform common approaches like MC-dropout as a measure of confidence, at a fraction of the computational cost.
Continual learning has received increasing attention from the scientific community during the last decade.
 Along with the recent development of the generative models, many unsupervised disentangled learning approaches have been proposed based on either the generative adversarial networks (GAN) (proposed as InfoGAN in Chen et al., (2016)) or the variational autoencoders (VAE) (proposed as β-VAE in Higgins et al., (2017)).
 A clear example of this effect can be found when an agent is trained with image inputs, versus training with access to the exact simulator states (Tassa et al., 2018; Pinto et al., 2018).
 Second, signal waves could be high dimensionals; motion capture data has 129 dimensions and acceleormeter data has 18 dimensions.
Many of the existing methods for metric constrained problems suffer from some sort of significant drawback that hampers performance or restricts the instance size.
 The key contributions in this paper are as follows.
 In addition, in preliminary experiments we also found the single reward signal provided by dev set accuracy at the end of training noisy to the extent that we were not able to achieve results competitive with simpler heuristic training methods.
 Throughout the model, the important pieces of the document are highlighted by what we call a reading module and integrated into a representation of the question via our reformulation module.
 The machinery of both approaches adopts a meta-learning episodic training procedure with integrated learning signals from unlabeled data.
Do multilingual models always need to be trained from scratch? Can we transfer linguistic knowledge learned by English pre-trained models to other languages? In this work, we develop a technique to rapidly transfer an existing pre-trained model from English to other languages in an energy efficient way (Strubell et al., 2019).
 The synthetic instructions that our agents are trained to follow require mastery of 26 fine-grained motor actions in order to identify and manipulate visually-realistic models from the ShapeNet dataset (Chang et al., 2015) in a 3D room.
 Thus, there has been a lack of attention on developing methods that focus on preserving the global structure of the data and likewise, practical performance measures to assess the global accuracy.
 This idea was elaborated on by Chaudhari et al., (2016) who suggest a new training method that favors flat over sharp minima even at the cost of a slightly higher empirical error – indeed solutions found by this algorithm exhibit better generalization performance.
1In this work, we propose a method to mitigate this problem, making DP learning feasible for modern image classifiers.
 There are two main approaches to studying this game.
In this paper, we seek to formalize pre-training in RL in a way that allows for scalable data collection.
As outlined in Section 2, there is a large body of work on evaluating video architectures on spatial and temporal correlations, but significantly fewer investigations of what parts of the data the networks have used and what semantics relating to the temporal dependencies they have extracted from it.
In the supervised setting, out-of-distribution detection has been studied from many different angles (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016; Nalisnick et al., 2018), but this task has not been investigated in the few-shot setting.
As an application of metagenomic sequencing, samples can be taken from the human intestine in order to characterize the microbial flora of the human gut (Methé et al., 2012; Qin et al., 2010).
 This work is the first that considers multidimensional uncertainty types in both DL and belief theory domains to predict node classification and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection.
In this work we propose a generator-reranker architecture that uses two neural networks for semantic parsing: a generator network, which generates a list of potential candidates, and a reranker system, which consists of a pre-processing step for the candidates followed by a novel critic network that reranks these candidates based on the similarity between each candidate and the input sentence.
 There has also been research on causal discovery (Hoyer et al., 2009; Janzing et al., 2009; Lopez-Paz et al., 2017; Kilbertus et al., 2018) where the problem is formulated as identifying the causal relation between random variables.
 Formally, the model parameters are updated byxt+1 = xt − ηt 1P P∑ p=1 Compk(g p t + p t ) and p t+1 = g p t + p t − Compk(g p t + p t ), (2)where pt ∈ Rd and p 0 = 0.
 First, each step requires solving a highdimensional optimization problem and thus is computationally prohibitive for applications requiring either real-time or low-latency reaction such as autonomous driving.
 We call these properties “asymptotic constraints” because this kind of property is known a priori for some physical systems before the detailed law is derived.
 In this paper, we focus on defending against the white-box attack which is the harder task.
 However, using this KL divergence for VI has been criticized for under-estimating the uncertainty (Bishop, 2006; Blei et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018a), which leads to poor model performance when uncertainty estimation is essential.
 In order to achieve that, Lee et al., (2018a) defined a loss function based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence metric to minimize the distance between the output distribution given by softmax and the uniform distribution for samples generated by a GAN (Goodfellow et al., 2014).
 Most neural net practitioners use a constant learning rate for the majority of training, with exponentially decaying learning rate schedules at the end, without seeing the method stall (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014; He et al., 2016; Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016).
 There is indeed a strong correlation between the performance of data augmentation operations in supervised learning and their performance in consistency training.
 First, an adaptive learning-rate can be computed for the non-stochastic gradient direction when the minimum value of the objective function is known (Polyak, 1969, Shor, 1985, Brännlund, 1995, Nedić & Bertsekas, 2001a;b).
For a long time there were only small labeled remote sensing datasets available.
 These methods, however, do not scale to large and practical networks used in solving modern machine learning problems.
 There is a large space of options for tweaking such architectures, in fact so large that it is difficult to tune an optimal configuration manually.
 Instead, we combine supervised reference trajectory tracking and unsupervised reinforcement learning to adapt the source policy to the target domain directly.
 A primary reason for the popularity of tree-based approaches is their representation power for decision manifolds with approximately hyperplane boundaries that are commonly observed for tabular data.
 This makes a heterogeneous search space.
 Here, a model is still trained using only labeled data, but extra care is taken when deciding which unlabeled data examples are to be labeled.
 Weiss et al., (2018) studied LSTMs with fully saturated weights (i.g, the activation functions evaluate to their asymptotic values instead of intermediate rational values) and showed that such models can express simplified counter languages.
 The main reason is that graphs lack the tensor representation and it is difficult to measure how accurate a subset of nodes represent the topological structure of the given graph.
On the other hand, humans naturally understand the independent causal mechanisms for visual recognition tasks, where the generative process of the perceived view is composed of modules that do not influence each other (Parascandolo et al., 2017).
 This paper follows this line of research, focusing on the teacher-student setting.
However, one shortcoming of this approach is that it is computationally very expensive since it requires repeatedly querying PDE solvers in order to get an estimate of the gradient.
 Recently, several studies have attempted incorporating knowledge about a physical system into deep learning.
 This transfer method is non-negative (it cannot cause performance degradation) as the computed upper bound does not underestimate the optimal Q-value function.
 Quantizing each datapoint xi to x̃i not only reduces storage costs and memory bandwidth bottlenecks, but also permits efficient computation of distances.
 Controlled experiments on noise levels are essential in thoroughly understanding a DNN’s properties across a spectrum of noise levels and faithfully comparing the strengths and weaknesses of different methods.
 There exist a large number of knowledge graphs that are publicly available, such as NELL (Carlson et al., 2010) and FREEBASE (Bollacker et al., 2008).
 This has led the community to develop theoretical tools to certify adversarial robustness.
 It is generated through backpropagation to train deep networks by minimizing designed loss functions (Rumelhart et al., 1986).
 This is presumably because users (as nodes) in the Flickr graph tend to follow users with similar interests, which illustrates a potential causal connection between node topology and node metadata.
 There is still a large gap between how people and machines ask questions.
 Taking a single sentence as the sole input of a style transfer model may fail to preserve topical coherency of the generated sentence with its surrounding context, resulting in poor semantic and logical consistency on the paragraph level (see Example C in Table 4).
In this work, we explore two different priors for successful coordination and use these to regularize the learned policies.
 Furthermore, while adversarial training leads to robust models for the employed threat model used during training, the obtained robustness does not translate to other threat models, e.g, other Lp-balls (Sharma & Chen, 2017; Song et al., 2018; Madry et al., 2018; Tramèr & Boneh, 2019; Li et al., 2019a; Kang et al., 2019), larger perturbations than the ones used during training or distal adversarial examples (Hein et al., 2019).
 Here the former uses expensive computation methods, e.g, mixed-integer programming (MIP), to find the exact robustness bound, and the latter considers a relaxed verification problem by convexifying the adversarial polytope but significantly improves the computation efficiency compared to the exact method.
The neighborhood of a node can be considered at different path lengths, or scales.
 In other words, the KD approaches maximize recall - the fraction of the top-k” tokens in q(yt|y<t,x) have been retrieved among the top-k′ in p(yt|y<t,x).
 In Section 2 we describe some other recent approaches to this problem.
 However, there are several challenges for this type of approaches: 1) how to learn one-to-more mapping between the input graph and the target graphs.
 Once the tree has been constructed, we run simulations to generate experiences using an Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees (UCT) approach 33.
In this work, we now propose a context-aware object detection strategy called conCNN to address the above shortcoming.
In this work, we introduce a fully parallel neural TTS system by proposing a non-autoregressive text-to-spectrogram model.
 More recently, joint models that simultaneously learn to extract entities and relations have been proposed, alleviating the aforementioned issues and achieving state-of-the-art performance (Miwa & Sasaki, 2014; Miwa & Bansal, 2016; Gupta et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Adel & Schütze, 2017; Bekoulis et al., 2018a;b; Nguyen & Verspoor, 2019; Li et al., 2019).
 The field of compressive sensing (or sparse recovery), introduced by the seminal works of (Candes et al., 2006; Donoho et al., 2006), has received significant attention in both ML theory and applications over the last decade, and has influenced the development of numerous advances in nonlinear and combinatorial optimization.
 Thus, the problem of network interpretation arises.
 The central topic of this paper is to explore a new curriculum for training deep generative models.
 One of the key insights we bring in our work is that a simple decoder head term is all that is needed to yield significant visual insight into a range of questions about the representations learned by deep networks.
One class of the self-explaining models borrows the interpretability of General Linear Models (GLMs) such as linear regression.
 However, the pruning is only used as a tool for studying the interpretability of CNNs filter.
 Substitute black-box attacks utilize pre-trained models to generate adversarial examples and apply these examples to attacked models.
 We employ document-level text summarization as an example, which usually has longer text than the maximum sequence length of BERT.
 In this paper, we propose a lossless SR model to obtain images with satisfying quality from the low-quality inputs (C-JPG).
 Finally, normalizing flows (Dinh et al., 2014) perform all three operations (sampling, density estimation, inference) efficiently.
Out-of-the-box Transformers nevertheless do not effectively generalize to rare reactions.
Although each subroutine represents a simple task compared to the full algorithm, this is nevertheless a challenging learning domain for several reasons.
 Instead, Bayes optimality only requires that agents be optimal with respect to their current uncertainty over latent MDPs.
 As such, they barely affect the typical GAN evaluation measures (like Inception and FID scores for images), which measure the quality of the generated distribution as a whole.
 For the TSP, existing ML based algorithms can be roughly classified into two paradigms, i.g,: (1) End-to-end ML paradigm which uses a ML model alone to directly convert the input instance to a solution.
 It can be impossible to correct for extrapolation error when there is a mismatch in the distribution of stateactions pairs in the batch data, and the distribution induced by the learned policy.
 In this article, we propose a method for discovering stochastic embeddings, where each embedded instance is a random variable whose distribution reflects the uncertainty in the embedding space.
 Typically, for the real-world applications such as object search or target-driven visual navigation, prior research prefers to construct the reward function in terms of the distance between the robot’s current location and the target location under the assumption that the full information of the environment is known (Mousavian et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018b;a).
 On many natural language tasks, this fixed input size is sufficient.
 Despite this progress with small models, on-chip training of larger models is bottlenecked by the limited memory size and compute horsepower of edge processors.
 The Level Set method for image segmentation evolves an initial contour of an object-of-interest along the normal direction with a forcing function.
 This has resulted in ever more useful pre-trained token embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Pennington et al., 2014).
 In this paper, we empirically verify the new metric using two complementary tests.
However, it should be noted that logical decision procedures is more complex that just reading the formulas correctly.
 Curriculum learning, inspired by strategies used for humans (Skinner (1958); Avrahami et al., (1997)), works by gradually increasing the conceptual difficulty of samples used to train deep networks (Bengio et al., (2009); Florensa et al., (2017); Graves et al., (2017)).
 But, GANs do not offer a latent space suitable for further downstream tasks, nor do they perform density estimation.
 These non-trivial developments imply that optimizing a policy on a synthesized environment is a challenging task.
 In particular, the multi-head attention mechanism in Transformer allows every position to be directly connected to any other positions in a sequence.
 Specifically, the formation of a team captures not only the global shape and structure the group, but also enables the ordering of each agent according to a “role” within the group structure.
 In this work, we address the following questions:• Are certain types of examples or classes disproportionately affected by pruning? • How does pruning impact robustness such as sensitivity to image corruptions (blur, noise,contrast) and adversarial examples?Answers for these question can provide intuition into the role of additional capacity in deep neural networks and, perhaps more important, provide a principled framework for articulating the tradeoffs incurred by compressing deep neural networks.
 Some early studies try to find sub-goals or critical states based on statistic methods (Hengst, 2002; Jonsson, 2006; Kheradmandian & Rahmati, 2009).
We propose to address this issue by using data-driven machine learning approaches to learn such heuristics, based on the data encountered by the combinatorial optimization algorithms in practice.
Extensive work in cognitive science (Baillargeon et al., 1985; Spelke, 2013) indeed show that human perception is structured around objects.
Many datasets are comprised of different representations of the data, or views.
 For example, if the task is to lift a red block, the positions of other blocks would be task-irrelevant; see Figures 1 and 2.
 Neural networks have achieved great success in many domains, such as computer vision (Liu et al., 2017), natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017), speech recognition (Chan et al., 2016), etc.
 The main challenge of the unseen attribute-object pair recognition is that the testing attribute-object pairs are not included in the training set.
The conclusions of Jain & Wallace (2019); Serrano & Smith (2019) have been mostly based on text classification experiments which might not generalize to several other NLP tasks.
 On this adversarial training, they make two important observations.
 These methods often leverage homogeneous assumption of certain hidden models over a large number of data points in order to perform joint inference.
 Obtaining the arg min of (1) in this case corresponds to finding the best values of the hyperparameters (and consequently getting the best trained model).
 Based on the gradient of the last convolutional layer instead of the input, Grad-CAM (Selvaraju et al., (2017)) is proposed to generate activation maps for all convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures.
 In this case, given a target molecule written in SMILES notation, the retrosynthesis prediction is just to predict a string of SMILES which represents the reactants.
 We assume that we have access to a training dataset of n subjects.
 Consistency across multiple object instances is also important, as we wish for our landmarks to apply to all instances within a visual category.
 Approximate dropout-based inference schemes (e.g, Monte Carlo dropout (Gal & Ghahramani (2016)) and variational dropout (Kingma et al., (2015))) have been recently proposed as computationally efficient alternatives.
 A general formulation of learning graph-structured models is maximizing the likelihood:max θ p(y|s0,x;Fθ, P ) (1)The objective describes the process where it takes in the information x over a graph, starts from initial states s0 and maps to the target output y.
 Sequences that are semantically similar but right below this specific threshold will be treated as negative examples and will thus inevitably introduce massive labeling noise in training.
To achieve a more significant reduction of FPR, researchers have generalized BF and incorporated information beyond the query itself to break through the theoretical lower bound of space usage.
 We can see that the norm will be large (proportional to the number of model parameters), especially for a multi-layer neural network, leading to a large “clipping impact” on the gradient, resulting in “smaller” clippedgradient magnitude, easily overwhelmed by noise, required for preserving differential privacy.
 For example, at least three consecutive GC layers are needed for atoms at the opposite side of a benzene ring to exchange information.
 To address this problem from a different direction, we want to borrow some power from the discriminator by incorporating the attention mechanism to help the generator.
 In these examples, there is a richer set of transformations T that capture semantically-meaningful changes to inputs to the ML model.
 Intuition behind this phenomenon can be gained by inspecting Figure 1a: exploration in regions where the return surface is flat leads to a random walk type search.
Empirically, and perhaps surprisingly, it turns out that the entropy rate of generated text is substantially higher than the estimate for true text derived from the model’s one-step predictions.
 However, the whole online quality or attention learning procedures are either manually designed or learned through a black box, which lacks explainability.
 These perturbation schemes have several limitations.
 However, most of existing RL methods (Sutton et al., 2000; Mnih et al., 2013; Schulman et al., 2015b) sum all future rewards to evaluate each action without considering their dependency.
 We term this desired property “channel equalization”.
 The discrete state, st ∈ {1, 2, . ,K}, represents the mode of the system at time t, and the continuous state, zi ∈ RH , represents other factors of variation, such as location and velocity.
 This target solution might help when the practitioner does not have access to reliable estimates of the noise rates (e.g, when the training data has limited size for the estimation tasks, or when the training data is already collected in a form that makes the estimation hard to perform).
 Thus, a common prognosis in each cluster remains unknown which can mystify the understanding of the underlying disease progression (Boudier et al., 2019).
The architecture of deep-learning-based NLP models can be broken down into three components.
Conventional dense and convolutional layers do not offer the user to individually tune layer size and the number of layer inputs and outputs.
 For sampling-based methods, only a few neighbors for every node will be sampled in every GCN layer, and thus the size of intermediate embeddings for every layer will be reduced for each mini-batch.
 Recently, it has also been observed (Reddi et al., 2018) that Adam does not converge in some settings where rarely encountered large gradient information quickly dies out due to the “short momery” problem of exponential moving average.
 It is natural to ask“Are there other values of τ that can guarantee the stability of ResNet with arbitrary depth?” We target the above question and unveil that τ = 1/ √ L is a sharp value in terms of characterizing the stability of forward/backward process of ResNet with a non-asymptotic analysis.
 Deep learning approaches have been successfully applied to attain state-of-the-art results on several tracking benchmarks such as VOT2018 (Kristan et al., 2017).
 Only fine-tuning is performed.
 These methods perturb the input and aim to find the smallest region, which alone allows a confident classification or prevents a confident classification once being removed (Dabkowski & Gal, 2017; Fong & Vedaldi, 2017).
In contrast to NTMs and the subsequent Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) (Graves et al., 2016), we intertwine memory units throughout the interior of a deep network.
 The final HR image is produced by aggregating the recovered HR patches.
 It has been further shown in some recent work that adversarial examples can be decomposed into categories with different causes including off-manifold ones (Stutz et al., 2019; Jacobsen et al., 2019) and those due to natural test error (Stutz et al., 2019; Jacobsen et al., 2019; Ford et al., 2019).
 In practice, model M(w;λ) is dependent on hyper-parameter λ, which may significantly influence the model.
 The state of affairs is reminiscent of Machine Learning (ML) before the popularization of Automatic Differentiation (AD).
In this work, we present a novel framework for training autoencoder-based generative models, with non-adversarial losses and unrestricted neural network architectures.
To address the above problem, we propose a cursor based adaptive quantization method to derive a different number of bits in different layers for DNN model compression, i.g,, we search for the bestconfiguration of different bit quantization for different layers in a neural network model.
 We recognize that the attack noise is not random and has sophisticated patterns.
 Our theoretical results imply a few cases where SGC and GCN would fail to work: high-frequency labels, noisy features, and complex features.
 To achieve the latter, we propose a soft dynamic recursion mechanism, which softly learns the depth of recursive parameterization at a per-token basis.
 Temporal logic provides a compact and intuitive formalism for capturing such properties that deal with temporal abstractions.
In conditional generation, we care about visual quality, conditional consistency – i.g,, verifying that the generation respects its conditioning, and intra-conditioning diversity – i.g,, sample diversity per conditioning.
 Recently, dynamic networks have been introduced which adopt a single model to meet varying computing resource constraints.
Unfortunately, existing PBL methods are typically designed for a specific task.
 Producing high-fidelity audio has been challenging for existing spectrogram models, which we attribute to the lossy nature of spectrograms and oversmoothing artifacts which result from insufficiently expressive models.
 Such a model will benefit from the natural rich activityof a powerful sensor (the human brain), but at the same time not burden the human if the activity being relied upon is intrinsic.
 The two papers both use three kinds of metrics to evaluate the training samples, namely uncertainty, information density, and graph centrality.
In this work we make use of the concept of Pareto optimality to measure and analyze discrimination (unfairness) in terms of the difference in predictive risks across sub-populations defined by our sensitive attributes, a fairness metric that has been explored in other recent works such as Calders & Verwer (2010); Dwork et al., (2012); Feldman et al., (2015); Chen et al., (2018); Ustun et al., (2019).
 A second branch, rooted in the distillation community (Hinton et al., 2015; Frosst & Hinton, 2017), simply uses the same data to train teacher and student (see also Ba & Caruana, 2014).
 They indicate more flexible fitting capability than the generative GMM and have been applied successfully in fields such as speech recognition (Axelrod et al., 2006; Tüske et al., 2015; Wang, 2007).
 For example, rush-hour traffic surge is temporally unsmoothed, while it occurs in many regions in a city.
 To this situation, most existing methods have to train separate models for MTS of each individual, which suffer from over-fitting especially given limited training samples.
 These models can be difficult to train to ensure that the decoder pays attention to the conditioning variable.
 This makes it difficult to introduce new factors of variation, which may be necessary to explain new data, or to differently taxonomize past data.
Other methods with not quite as strict assumptions on the distribution of the data can work on arbitrary distributions, such as One-Class methods (4) and IsolationForest (3) to name just a few.
 Unfortunately, they tend to suffer from major drawbacks like computational cost (Hooker et al., 2018), inability to be extended to non-image domains (Kindermans et al., 2017a), or simply focusing only one desirable attribute of a good explainer. (Yeh et al., 2019).
 However, it has limitation on describing what the model perceives in detail.
 However, the learned model tends to overfit on the training data and fails to keep robust on unseen testing data.
 The idea for the retrospection loss is simple - to ensure that the predictions at a training step are more similar to the ground truth than to the predictions from a previous training step.
We focus on three research questions.
 The major difference between these pair-based losses lies at how the pairs interact with each other in a mini-batch.
 Despite promising progress, there are still challenges in learning effective models.
A recent study (Yang et al., 2017) has shown that almost 70% of the energy footprint on such hardware is due to data movement to and from the off-chip memory.
 Moreover, they are highly prone to error propagation.
 The regularization term modifies the original training and can be expensive in hardware.
 Non-local networks introduce a convolution-like operator that adds long-range connections into the typical lattice convolution operation (Wang et al., 2018c).
 Consequently, adaptation layers have been embedded in the pipeline of deep feature learning to learn concurrently from the source domain supervision and some specially designed domain discrepancy losses (Tzeng et al., 2014; Long et al., 2015; Sun & Saenko, 2016; Zellinger et al., 2017).
When considering the connection between two neural networks, it is important for us to consider what properties of the neural networks are intrinsic.
 Though several theoretical studies (Maron et al., (2019) and Sannai et al., (2019)) prove a universal approximation property of neural networks for invariant data and guarantee that invariant deep neural networks have sufficient expressive power, the generalization power of the invariant deep neural networks is left as an open question.
 The abundance of existing approaches reflects a lack of consensus on the correct optimization objective for unsupervised feature selection.
 In this paper, we show the word embedding can be understood as a low rank transformation process.
 Tomczak & Welling (2018) proved the optimal prior is the aggregated posterior, which they approximate by assembling a mixture of the posteriors with a set of learned pseudo-inputs.
 Specifically, this means analyzing their ability to learn bi-Lipschitzneural networks, i.g,Lipschitz continuous neural networks with a bound on the Lipschitz constant of the forward and inverse mapping.
In addition, all the existing randomized smoothing methods use Gaussian noise for smoothing.
 However none of the works in the literature seek to provide a holistic view of the fairness-accuracy landscape of the algorithm.
 In the task-agnostic phase, we obtain world graphs by training a recurrent variational auto-encoder (VAE) (Chung et al., 2015; Gregor et al., 2015; Kingma & Welling, 2013) with binary latent variables (Nalisnick & Smyth, 2016) over trajectories collected using a random walk policy (Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018) and a curiosity-driven goal-conditioned policy (Ghosh et al., 2018; Nair et al., 2018).
 To model epistemic uncertainty, variational inference (VI) instead approximates the true posterior with a simpler distribution.
 This approach has yielded impressive performance and has shown promise in improving generalization for unseen graphs.
 Ribeiro et al., (2016) propose the LIME procedure, where small perturbations on the instance are used to obtain additional samples with which a sparse linear model is fit.
 One of the interesting findings in (Su et al., 2018) is that model architecture is a more critical factor to network robustness than model size (e.g, number of layers).
 We have no access to future data, and the Shannon Information their representation contains does not account for the finite training set, hence missing a link to generalization.
 Each information set has its own backed-up Q-values and corresponding “policy commitments” responsible for inducing these values.
 These methods have achieved significantly improved feature representations of text/image/video data, but they are often inapplicable to tabular data since it does not contain the required temporal or spatial supervisory information.
New models developed so far either relied on some interpretable yet simple prediction methods, such as logistic regression (Calvert et al., 2016) and decision tree based classifiers (Mao et al., 2018; Delahanty et al., 2019), or on effective yet black-box methods such as Recurrent Neural Networks (Futoma et al., 2017b).
 Current decision-based attacks, including Brendel et al., (2017); Cheng et al., (2018); Chen et al., (2019b); Cheng et al., (2019), are based on iterative local updates – starting from an initial point on the decision surface, they iteratively move the points along the surface until reaching a local minimum (in terms of distance to the original example).
 Specifically, MentorNet pre-trains an extra network, and then uses the extra network for selecting clean instances to guide the training.
 For example, Bischof et al., (1992) used a second classifier to do pixel smoothing to refine predictions made by another classifier.
 The reason is that not all decisions made by the agent are equally important.
 While leveraging a statistical test simplifies the loss function for training GMMN, in practice, the diversity of generated samples by GMMN is highly sensitive to the choice of the kernel.
 Our key intuition is that decision states exist in an environment independent of extrinsic goals.
 A multi-class softmax DNN classifier is trained with in-distribution samples to minimize the standard cross-entropy loss (minimizing the output entropy) and the generated OOD samples are trained to minimize a KL loss that forces the classifier’s predictive distribution to follow a uniform one (maximizing the output entropy).
 This is because in the presence of such shifts, the discriminator may either simply use the embodiment or dynamics to infer whether it is evaluating expert behavior, and as a consequence fails to provide a meaningful reward signal.
 To avoid these problems, a dynamics model can be used for imaginary rollouts, the so-called Model-based Value Expansion (MVE) (Feinberg et al., 2018).
In this work, we aim to enable meta-learning in task-unsegmented settings, operating directly on time series in which the latent task undergoes discrete, unobserved switches, rather than requiring a pre-segmented meta-dataset.
 It is observed (Osband et al., 2017; 2018) that a Bayesian uncertainty1 estimate plays an important role in efficient exploration in deep RL, but is unfortunately not appropriately addressed in the majority of state-of-the-art RL algorithms.
 Of particular relevance, Ford et al., (2019) has established connections between popular notions of adversarial robustness and some measures of distribution shift considered here.
 For the Mujoco benchmark, we demonstrate that when using the standard objective without entropy along with standard additive noise exploration, there is often insufficient exploration due to the bounded nature of the action spaces.
 Answering these questions is important since it may speed-up the winning ticket generation process, which is computationnally expensive, and also open new perspectives about generating sparse subnetworks that may be trained efficiently on new tasks.
 The autoencoder is1We will make source code of LIA publicly availableof mapping x f7→ y g7→ x̃.
 The aforementioned biological, representational and computational considerations provide compelling motivations for designing learning models for tasks where the complex-valued representation of the input and output data is more desirable than their real-counterpart.
 GANs have been used in semi-supervised and unsupervised learning areas, such as fake dataset synthesis (Radford et al., 2016; Brock et al., 2019), style transfer (Zhu et al., 2017b; Azadi et al., 2018), and image-to-image translation (Zhu et al., 2017a; Choi et al., 2018).
As shown in Figure 1, UNITER first encodes image regions (visual features and bounding box features) and textual words (tokens and positions) into a common embedding space with Image Embedder and Text Embedder, then applies a Transformer module to learn generalizable contex-tualized embeddings for each region and word through aforementioned pre-training tasks.
 It makes us to obtain an approximate solution to Problem (1).
 Similarily, we find improved visual representations help agents perform better reward optimization.
 Their performance is hampered by the fact that they only make use of hand-designed features.
 Successful algorithmic extensions to the central idea include training a differential private model (McMahan et al., 2018), compression (Konečný et al., 2016b; Caldas et al., 2018a), secure aggregation (Bonawitz et al., 2017), and a smaller number of always-participating nodes (Yang et al., 2019).
 For the classification problems with logistic loss, a few studies (Allen-Zhu et al., 2018a; Cao & Gu, 2019a;b) investigated the convergence and generalization abilities of gradient descent under a separability assumption with a suitable model instead of the positivity of the neural tangent kernel.
 Local analysis can tell us the behavior of the algorithms near the desired point, but how do we know that the algorithm will arrive there and not at some highly sub-optimal points? Answering this question requires a global landscape analysis or a study of global training dynamics.
 A game is dominance solvable if only one action profile survives the process of iteratively eliminating strictly dominated strategies.
Our contributions in this work are as follows.
Some researchers try to reduce this difference with GAN (Goodfellow et al., 2014).
 The solution of the PZSL problem will greatly promote many downstream tasks, such as generating image caption with vivid predicates which are even unseen in the description corpus (image captioning) and answering the open questions (with novel predicates) on the complex scene (VQA).
Do our artificial neural networks perform similarly? In this work, we aim to answer this question by measuring artificial recurrent neural networks’ (RNNs) capacity to compress the past while retaining relevant information about the future.
 The only related work we are aware of (Gebauer et al., 2018; 2019) demonstrates the generation of chemical compounds, placing atom by atom with an autoregressive model.
To compute a molecular property for a molecule, one must sample from p(x).
In this paper, motivated by practical advertising applications, we consider unsupervised domain adaptation (i.g, labels are not available in the target domain) for classification when (1) part of input data is missing in the target domain thus requiring some form of imputation, (2) there is no possible supervision in the target domain for imputation thus requiring indirect supervision from the source domain, and (3) there exists a domain shift between the source and target distributions requiring domain adaptation.
 Hallucinating additional training data by generating images may seem like an easy solution for few-shot learning, but it is often challenging.
 Though generative classifiers have shown promising results of adversarial robustness, they hardly achieve acceptable classification performance even on CIFAR10 (Li et al., 2018; Schott et al., 2018; Fetaya et al., 2019).
 An ideal direction is to discover new solutions in a fully unsupervised manner, potentially outperforming those based on domain-specific knowledge.
 The set of labeled examples is also very limited; in the extreme case, only one labeled example is provided for each class (called one-shot classification).
 In essence, overlooking dynamic spatial correlations will lead to modest forecasting performance.
1We consider the distribution over terminal states in a finite horizon task and believe this work can be extended to infinite horizon stationary distributions.
 As highlighted in the next section such behaviour is intrinsic in the variational loss, the Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO), encouraging a less informative representation.
 For example, Figure 1(a) illustrates a function interpolation problem via cubic splines which exemplifies this phenomenon.
 Deep RL methods generate new models by sampling from a learned distribution, and cannot easily latch on to patterns of a single model, unless it has been promoted multiple times through the learning process.
 Stamoulis et al., (2019) significantly reduced the search costs for NAS by applying a gradient-based search scheme with a superkernel that shares weights for multiple convolutional kernels.
 In particular, unsupervised manifold alignment (Cui et al., 2014; Wang & Mahadevan, 2009) aims to learn plausible correspondences between the data points of different manifolds, without any ground-truth correspondence information is given.
 Therefore, they are too “easy” because they do not test the ability of supervised few-shot classification methods to adapt to new class semantics.
 This also leads to missing modes due to posterior collapse (Bowman et al., 2016; Razavi et al., 2019).
 To the best of our knowledge this is the first sample–specific feature importance explanation benchmark at observation level for time series models.
Our contributions.
 In one-shot approaches, prior works focus on adopting a fixed sampling strategy (Guo et al., (2019); Bender et al., (2018); Chu et al., (2019)).
 For example, as illustrated in Figure 1, the agent starts in the bottom left corner where it can easily collect apples near its initial location by random exploration and achieve a small positive reward.
 Moreover, hypergraphs can encode additional relationships with directions as illustrated in Figure 1 and these hypergraphs are directed hypergraphs Gallo et al., (1993).
Nevertheless, DNNs are still not robust to identity-preserving transformations, including simple image translations (Zhang, 2019).
 Meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) addresses such problems by learning how to learn.
 These challenges have motivated researchers to consider simpler models, henceforth referred to as partial models, i.g,models which are neither conditioned on, nor generate the full set of observed data (Guo et al., 2018; Gregor et al., 2019; Amos et al., 2018).
1. The episodic memory is simply populated with the last m = M/T examples from each task in their current implementation, where M is the total budget size of memory locations for totally T tasks.
 Specifically, the idea of creating new training images from existing images using pixel translation and flips, while assuming that these operations should not change the label.
 The first way focuses on the primary objective exclusively, hoping that the agent could learn more flexible policies.
 Unfortunately, its advantages have not been without cost: empirically, the test accuracy of differentially private ML is consistently lower than that of non-private learning (e.g, see Papernot et al., (2018)).
 meProp does not modify the forward pass.
 Figure 1 depicts our main idea which we provide more rigorous formulation next.2 Methodology
 This number can be reduced by compressing the feature maps.
When it comes to data generation, generative adversarial networks (GANs, Goodfellow et al., 2014) is the most popular family of generative algorithms because of its impressive performance on generating realistic images (Karras et al., 2018).
 In order to mitigate these issues, DAgger (Ross et al., 2011) uses an expert policy to provide supervision to the policy being learned.
 To solve this problem, our paper proposes a hybrid weight representation (HWR), expressing networks with both ternary weights (TW) and sparse-large weights (SLW).
 In practice, a model trained using data from one distribution is often used on a (slightly) different distribution.
 Given the severe performance degradation of NP due to the under-fitting, an important key question is whether SNP would also suffer from the under-fitting problem or not, and its follow-up questions such as if so, how severely and in which settings would it happen? and how can we resolve the problem—would the same attention mechanism that worked for NP work for SNP as well? In this paper, our goal is to answer these questions.
On a high level, semantic segmentation is classification, where each pixel is classified based on its neighborhood.
 Many machine learning platforms like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet adopt MSGD as one of the optimization methods.
 The intrinsic dimension being lower than the dimension of the input space is a property expected to be common to many real data sets used in machine leanring.
 Our extensive experiments demonstrate that,
 These limits lead to two consequences: (i) When there is a budget on transmission bits, source and channel coding errors need to be balanced for best reconstruction results.
 Since CANs inject the constraints directly into the learned model, valid structures can be obtained with high probability by performing forward inference on the generator, avoiding the need for costly sampling or optimization steps (Volz et al., 2018).
 However, VAEs maximize a data likelihood estimate based on the L1/L2 reconstruction cost which leads to lower overall sample quality – blurriness in case of image distributions.
 Motivated by this finding, recent works have tried to develop more effective scores by correcting the likelihood estimate (Choi & Jang, 2018; Ren et al., 2019; Nalisnick et al., 2019).
 However, these approaches cannot be applied to large-scale graphs because of the exponential time complexity.
The main contribution of this paper is a novel and general method to generate unrestricted adversarial inputs.
 This becomes computationally expensive for neural network based wrapper methods (Verikas & Bacauskiene, 2002; Kabir et al., 2010; Roy et al., 2015).
 Domain knowledge can include external sources such as WordNet (Miller, 1995), ConceptNet (Liu & Singh, 2004), and knowledge graphs (Pujara & Singh, 2018) for text modeling, as well as clusters of users and items for user modeling (Zhang et al., 2012).
 In particular, we use a deep neural network with the ReLU activation function to approximate the action-value function.
 Deep ensembles, proposed by Lakshminarayanan et al., (2017), train an ensembleof neural networks by initializing at M different values and repeating the minimization multiple times which could lead to M different solutions, if the loss is non-convex.
When an accurate model of robot dynamics is given, model-based methods such as model-predictive control (MPC) or trajectory optimization have historically been employed.
 Prior work has attempted to learn state representations from pixels with autoencoders, utilizing a two-step training procedure, where the representation is first trained via the autoencoder, and then either with a policy learned on top of the fixed representation (Lange & Riedmiller, 2010; Munk et al., 2016; Higgins et al., 2017b; Zhang et al., 2018; Nair et al., 2018), or with planning (Mattner et al., 2012; Finn et al., 2015).
 In such cases where the original data is not available, data-free methods are gaining traction.
 To address the non-IID issue under federated learning, there have been a variety of recent works1; nevertheless, in this paper we explore more fundamental factors, the effects of various hyperparameters.
 Our contributions are as follows:
 This approach has multiple limitations.
 Instance counting can be obtained as a by-product of this task.
 Please note that differences in accuracies are reported in absolute percentage points unless stated otherwise.
 In this paper, we propose to extend a decoder with a facility to copy entire spans of the input to the output in a single step, thus greatly reducing the number of decoder steps required to generate an output.
 Mishkin & Matas (2015), Krähenbühl et al., (2015) and Zhang et al., (2019) have all demonstrated empirically that some of the benefits of batch normalization can be recovered by improving the initialization scheme.
 Unfortunately, these methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality (17) and are not applicable to real life problems.
 In more recent times, the transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) has emerged as a powerful architecture to model complex dependencies across a long sequence using global self-attention.
 Another application is automatic tagging of images with OOD objects, which would then be sent for human labelling.
 An anomalous sample is not always associated with negativity.
 We demonstrate that this way of directly maximizing the state entropy, compared to indirectly maximizing the mutual information (WardeFarley et al., 2018; Pong et al., 2019) improves the ex-ploration of the state space as well as the convergence speed at solving tasks with sparse terminal rewards.
 More recently, the study by Le et al., (2019) designed the `1-`1-RNN, which stems from unfolding an algorithm that solves the `1-`1 minimization problem (Mota et al., 2017; 2016).
 Structured factors, such as scale and orientation, are enumerated like any other variation, and require duplicated learning across different layers and channels.
Unsupervised feature learning or self-supervised learning is a very active area of research in deep learning, often taking the form of pre-training on artificial tasks with no human supervision for representation learning, followed by supervised fine-tuning on different target tasks like classification or object detection (Doersch et al., 2015; Wang & Gupta, 2015; Gidaris et al., 2018; Caron et al., 2018).
 Currently, researchers are making efforts along this direction by setting up general evaluation benchmarks, such as GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) and SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019), which involve a diverse set of datasets.
 Therefore, it is more reasonable to gradually design new lines to expand the metro network according to current city dynamic.
With the emergence of deep learning techniques, VC has become more efficient.
In this paper, we propose to learn the preconditioner of DPGD using a neural network.
 Unlike traditional embeddings, our function f is trained to represent the set of classes that is associated with each example, so that questions about set union and subsumption can be answered by comparing vectors in the embedding space.
 In this paper, we refer to a domain as belonging to either seen or unseen, and call the problem that class prediction is biased to the seen domain as the domain bias problem.
To illustrate these hardware benefits, we synthesized arithmetic logic units (ALUs) in different formats and different precision on an FPGA and present performance estimates in operations per second (OPs) and area estimates in Look-up Tables (LUTs) per operation (LUTs/Op) in Figure 1.
 Our approach leverages a compression technique that decomposes each data item into deltas, each of which increases data fidelity.
 According to (Gunasekar et al., 2017; Arora et al., 2019), given enough entries and independent of the depth, overparametrized deep matrix factorization (DMF) models are equivalent1 to nuclear norm minimization.
 Advanced de-noising networks are capable of generalizing to multiple levels of a type of noise and effective for different noise types (Zhussip & Chun (2018); Soltanayev & Chun (2018); Zhang et al., (2017)).
Our representation generalizes DeepSets slightly, and it also turns out to be a generalization of the Transformer’s position encodings (Vaswani et al., 2017).
 In contrast, we are interested in linking performance directly to the distance between train and test distribution.
At the same time, routing networks (Rosenbaum et al., 2018) have been introduced as powerful models, which route each input sample through its own path, selectively activating only parts of the network.
As is the case with existing models, we expect our model to explain only limited aspects of V1, some of which are: (1) The receptive fields of V1 simple cells resemble Gabor filters (Daugman, 1985).
In this paper, we focus on a more general and challenging problem of training a natural media painting agent for interactive applications.
 To the best of our knowledge, the few-shot OCC (FS-OCC) problem has only been addressed by Kozerawski & Turk (2018) in the image domain.
 Such approaches are examples of self-supervision, where labels are derived from the input (as opposed to external sources).
 Although there is experimental evidence that their framework improves the performance of baseline classifiers in extreme regions on low dimensional data, there is no reason to assume that the previously mentioned text embeddings satisfy the required regularity assumptions.
 The update, affect, and depend arrows are characterized by parameters of the model.
 Based on these techniques, we also provide the first system capable of certifying interesting properties of generative networks.
 At each SGD iteration, each processor computes an updated stochastic gradient using its own local data.
 Networks with tanh-nonlinearities (among other bounded activations) exhibit a phase transition between two limiting spectral distributions of the conjugate kernel as a function of their hyperparameters with ξ diverging at the transition.
 Word2Vec representations don’t change depending on the context.
 The memorization of long sequences with orthogonal models can require a large number of hidden units, increasing the hidden state size and the cost in time and space.
 In addition, it is preferable to not to rely on modifications of the inputs but have a network that is inherently robust against attacks.
 A challenge, however, is that unlike image pixels that are spatially regular, graph nodes are irregularly connected and hence pooling is less straightforward.
 More recently, the success of BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) in natural language processing shows the great usefulness of both the attention mechanism and the framework of Transformer.
One-dimensional trajectories and their evolution through deep networks are also of interest in their own right because they constitute simple data manifolds.
 One could specifically train a recognition model only on these output images produced by the denoising model to achieve better performance on such images, or could leverage some domain adaptation approaches to adapt therecognition model to this domain, but the performance on natural images can be harmed.
 Another example concerns natural videos.
 Proper uncertainty quantification is especially crucial for safety-related tasks and applications.
Caccia et al., (2018) have made several surprising observations and argued that, through simple temperature sweeping at inference stage, MLE models can constantly outperform these RL-based GANs models by a large margin over quality-diversity space under several metrics.
 Indeed, value function approximators provide noisy estimates (imprecise) of values (static) to every state (global).
 Motivated by the findings mentioned above, we leverage an attribute-conditional image editing model (Choi et al., 2018) to synthesize adversarial examples by interpolating between source and target images in the feature-map space.
 Levy et al., (2018) proposed to improve MCMC using flexible non-linear transformations given by neural networks and gradientbased auto-tuning strategies.
 In the case of parallel sentences, the conditionals correspond to translations from one channel to another while the marginals correspond to standard monolingual language models.
 However, none of them have properly answered the following fundamental questions of GNNs: (1) Is there a best filter that works for all graphs? (2) If not, what are the properties of graph structure that will influence the performance of graph convolutional filters? (3) Can we design an algorithm to adaptively find the appropriate filter for a given graph?In this paper, we focus on addressing the above three questions for semi-supervised node classification task.
 Our main findings are:
 Thus, with a few samples, we can estimate F (x).
Deep neural networks (DNN) achieve state-of-the-art prediction performances on several domains like computer vision (Huang et al., 2018; Tan & Le, 2019) and natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017; Gehring et al., 2017).
 Ideally, we’d like to specify which kinds of SIDS are acceptable, i.g,the means by which a learner is intended or allowed to influence the world in order to achieve its’ ends (i.g, increase its performance), but doing so in full generality can be difficult.
 For instance, Field-aware Factorization Machine (FFM) (Juan et al., 2016) is proposed to conduct fine-grained feature interaction.
 Pathak et al., (2017); Burda et al., (2019a) introduce a forward dynamics model for predicting the feature representation of the next state based on the current state and the action taken by the agent, which is known as next-frame prediction.
 However, the lack of temporal annotations renders the aforementioned approaches infeasible.
 CPC is a general technique that only requires in its definition that observations be ordered along e.g, temporal or spatial dimensions, and as such has been applied to a variety of different modalities including speech, natural language and images.
 As many interesting and realistic systems are formed from a large number of atoms, a computationally efficient and accurate method for chemical property estimation that scales well to these large systems would prove significantly useful in practical applications (Gomes et al., 2008).
 We pose the novel question regarding this assumption: does there exist a set of experts that are adversarial to an external observer trying to behaviour clone?We propose Adversarial Policy Ensembles (APE), a method that simultaneously optimizes the performance of the ensemble and minimizes the performance of policies eventually obtained from cloning it.
Recent work (Allen & Hospedales, 2019; Allen et al., 2019) theoretically explains how semantic properties are encoded in word embeddings that (approximately) factorise a matrix of word cooccurrence pointwise mutual information (PMI), e.g, as is known for W2V (Levy & Goldberg, 2014).
 Rather than improving the performance of a neural network given a curated training set, here we are more interested in how annotated samples can be more efficiently utilized to reach a level of performance.
When humans driving a car, they do not know any specific safety constraint and still perform well.
There have been numerous attempts (Hubara et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2016; De Sa et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2017) to train deep neural networks at lower precision (below 16-bits) with varying degrees of success.
 Such scenarios include models with discrete stochastic variables (10), learned models in RL like Q-learning (11), truncated backpropagation through time (12) and feedback alignment (13), see (14) for a detailed exhibition.
 It would be highly useful if we could reverse engineer the internal components of a neural circuit based on recordings of the output and our choice of input stimuli.
In this paper, we present an imitation learning approach that combines language, vision, and motion in order to synthesize natural language-conditioned control policies that have strong generalization capabilities while also capturing the semantics of the task.
 The seminal work LISTA (Gregor & LeCun, 2010; Sprechmann et al., 2013; Zhang & Ghanem, 2018) and its consecutive variations (Zhou et al., 2018; Moreau & Bruna, 2016; Ito et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2016) have largely improved the SR performance by simply unfolding iterations of existing SR algorithms into limited number of neural network layers, and then training the network through back propagation with huge amount of data.
Independently, there has been an increasing amount of work studying the dynamic model of interacting systems utilizing implicit interaction models (Sukhbaatar et al., 2016; Hoshen, 2017; Van Steenkiste et al., 2018).
 Since random forests ensemble the internal decision trees, they are more robust to noise and overfitting problem than single decision trees.
This work We address both of these challenges and propose an end-to-end verification method for neural network based audio classifiers and an implementation of this method in a system called DAC (Deep Audio Certifier).
 The generalization is non-trivial and requires careful handling of operations such as interpolation.
 Since sampling and multiple NN executions are difficult to be parallelized, the inference execution takes an order of magnitude more time.
Observation 1.
 Figure 1(b) and Figure 1(c) are the overview of AT and FT.
 In particular, we make the following contributions:
 They have also identified variants of GDA with better stability properties in both theory and practice, most notably those using negative momentum.
 Therefore, it learns from word occurrences across documents and encodes a coarse-granularity description.
 Moreover, researchers in deep RL focus more on high-level algorithm designs, which is more closely related to the field of reinforcement learning, and focus less on network training techniques such as regularization.
 In addition, DCNNs rely on their implicitly learned generalization probability and most of the stateof-the-art architectures do not make use of any domain specific knowledge, such as neighborhood relations and connectivity priors for segments.
 Recently, generative replay (GR)-based approaches such as DGR (Shin et al., (2017)) and VGR (Farquhar & Gal (2018)) are also proposed to replay previous tasks with a generative model instead of storing the small number of images into coreset.
 Take the basketball as an example: learning the passing, catching and shooting skills in an isolated way cannot guarantee to score in the court due to the possible failure in the process of transitions between skills.
 They are usually specified in English and/or by examples (Gulwani et al., 2012) such as “Extract the area code from a phone number” and/or “(212)123-4567”→ “212”.
 In such challenging scenarios, already approximate predictions are useful as they could, for example, optimize strategies for sensor placement, guide procedures for human-based scanning, or improve workflows for digital prototyping.
 The htanh function is a piece-wise linear version of the nonlinear hyper-bolic tangent, and is known to be inferior in terms of accuracy compared to ReLU-like activation function.
 A suite of weight pruning techniques have been developed, such as non-structured weight pruning (Han et al., 2015), structured weight pruning (Wen et al., 2016), filter pruning (Li et al., 2016), channel pruning (He et al., 2017), ADMM-NN (Ren et al., 2019) and PCONV (Ma et al., 2019) to name a few.
 Lastly, learning such representation should be unsupervised.
 As shown in fig.  1, traditional distributed training algorithm scales poorly under such large latency.
 We compare two architectures to implement such models: one based on a 2D-convolutional sequence-to-sequence model (Elbayad et al., 2018), and one based on the attention-based transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017).
 In the limit of small , these modifications don’t influence the second objective, leading to the discriminator maximizing both objectives.
 For example, (Alain & Bengio, 2016) experimentally observe that the linear separability of features increases monotonically along the depth of a DNN.
While it is important to reduce errors in each prediction, it is also important to acknowledge that uncertain situations might not have one but multiple possible outcomes.
 As shown in (Li et al., 2019), the graph convolutional operator used in GCN and many follow-up works acts as a low-pass graph filter that smooths a node’s features with its neighbours’.
 Intuitively, for a faithful attribution score, removing the most salient features would naturally lead to a large difference in prediction score.
 Classical models are interpretable, but GANs are not.
 Recently, encoding methods like maxout and dropout (Goodfellow et al., (2013)) and local winner-takes-all (Srivastava et al., (2013)) have been explored to create sparsified feature representations to minimize task-specific representation overlap.
4 We seek a representation that will expose the similarity between “networks” in (1) and “syrup” in (2) while ignoring the similarity between “syrup” in (2) and “syrup” in (4).1In this work we focus on English. 2We focus on lexical semantics. 3There is a syntactic distinction between the two, with “maple” being part of a noun compound and “neural” being an adjective.
Great efforts have been made in seek of explanations about the spectral bias.
Recently, several clever variance reduction methods (Roux et al., 2012; Defazio et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013; Johnson & Zhang, 2013) were proposed to alleviate the noisy gradient problem by using control-variates to achieve unbiased and lower-variance gradient estimators.
Similarly to Ballé et al., (2016); Theis et al., (2017); Ballé et al., (2018), we aim to minimize the rate-distortion of our model directly, but unlike them we replace entropy coding with a more general coding technique that allows us to use probability densities for coding instead of probability masses.
 By contrast, we are becoming increasingly aware that various heuristic techniques—such as dropout (Baldi & Sadowski, 2013; Wager et al., 2013; Srivastava et al., 2014), batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015; Salimans & Kingma, 2016; Bjorck et al., 2018), and even stochastic gradient descent (Hardt et al., 2015; Bousquet & Elisseeff, 2002; Yao et al., 2007)—that are used in deep neural networks provide implicit regularization, having effects that are not as transparent.
 For hard applications or games, these heuristic methods are insufficient enough and the agent needs exploration techniques that can incorporate meaningful information about the environment.
 However, action space generalization is relatively unexplored and is crucial for agents to be flexible in the face of novel circumstances, like selecting an unseen sponge for a known task of cleaning in above example.
In materials discovery, we may derive benefit from or be antifragile 15 towards high aleatoric uncertainty.
 As a result, our new Fractional Generalized Graph Convolutional Networks (FGCN) method allows to more accurately account for the intrinsic local graph topology and to substantially improve classification performance, especially for heterogeneous graphs.
 As a result, an inference method can be used to aggregate each of the classifiers predictions and output an accurate noisy label for each of the unlabelled data points.
 A compact latent representation is often more conducive for planning, which can further reduce the number of environment interactions required to learn a good policy (Watter et al., 2015; Banijamali et al., 2017; Finn et al., 2016; Ichter & Pavone, 2019; Zhang et al., 2019; Hafner et al., 2019).
 An iterative process can be applied here to ensure the attack success rate.
 Every training example adds support to a learned higher-order, evidential distribution.
In this paper, we show that the target of maximizing the support of state distribution (discovering new states) and maximizing the entropy of state distribution (unifying visited state distribution) can be both achieved by the goal-conditioned policy.
 For example, the generated sample g(z) deviates from the real distribution of X when sampling from the given prior due to that the learnt qf (z|x) is incapable of matching the prior distribution well.
 Words like ‘good’ or ‘bad’ may transfer more knowledge from sentiment analysis tasks, while words like ‘because’ or ‘so’ may transfer more from discourse relation identification tasks.
Existing uDA methods are centralized by design, in that they assume that each target domain would always adapt from the labeled source domain (Sfin).
 Altering this question, however, can increase model confidence for this same prediction to 99%, even though the new question is unanswerable given the same context.
 By further pretraining a language model on a domain specific unlabeled corpus, the model can learn the semantic relations in the text of the target domain, which is likely to have a different distribution than a general corpus.
 Such representations are then used to train a simple linear classifier to predict tissue-specific protein function.
The contributions of this paper are:
 Indeed, many recent works analyzed the learning trajectories of deep linear networks under gradient descent to compute the convergence rate under various initial conditions (Arora et al., 2018a;b; Bartlett et al., 2019; Du & Hu, 2019), revealed decoupled modes of convergence dynamics to explain the origin of multiplestage-like loss profiles (Saxe et al., 2013), and showed the implicit bias for regularization (Du et al., 2018; Arora et al., 2019) and resistance to overfitting (Advani & Saxe, 2017; Lampinen & Ganguli, 2018; Poggio et al., 2018).
 Nevertheless, current GZSL works focus on visual tasks (Xian et al., 2017; Felix et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019).
 For the other types of energy forms, their parameterization are generally set a priori and not learnt from the data.
 We ask the following questions:
 However, naïvely increasing the batch size typically results in degradation of generalization performance and reduces computational benefits (Goyal et al., 2017).
 Otherwise, unfiltered noisy labels still influence the (supervised) loss and affect the task performance as in these previous works.
It has been observed that in general, cross-entropy based sequence training has several limitations like exposure bias and inconsistency between train/test measurement (Ranzato et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016).
Recent developments in MTRL achieve significant results in feature extraction by means of algorithms specifically developed to address these issues.
 In §4 we discuss this peakiness effect (PKE).
 We argue that such information is important and should be explicitly captured in graph pooling.
 One can easily handle unbalanced graph size by adding dummy nodes as a common protocol in graph matching literature (Cho et al., 2010).
(b) The process of Graph inference learning.
The main idea in this paper is that the effectiveness of adversarial imitation methods can be achieved by a much simpler approach that does not require adversarial training, or indeed learning a reward function at all.
 The NODE architecture is partially inspired by the recent CatBoost package (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018), which was shown to provide state-of-the-art performance on a large number of tabular datasets.
Code is available at github
 This knowledge comes in the form of a labelled dataset of images for a certain set of classes.
Double Q-learning (van Hasselt, 2010) is introduced to instead ensure underestimation bias.
 First, the data are stored locally and cannot be shared, which hampers mainstream domain adaptation methods as they need to access both the labeled source and unlabeled target data (Tzeng et al., 2014; Long et al., 2017; Ghifary et al., 2016; Sun & Saenko, 2016; Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015; Tzeng et al., 2017).
 UT uses a layer which contains as many weights as an entire standard Transformer and this layer is applied several times which impacts speed.
 Han et al., (2015b) enforce an element-wise `0 constraint by iterative pruning a fixed percentage of smallest weight elements, which is a heuristic method and therefore can hardly achieve optimal compression rate.
 We reached the surprising conclusions that, as shown in Table 1, none of them significantly outperforms random sampling.
 To tackle this problem, we propose to learn a diversity sampling function (DSF) that can reliably generate a diverse set of trajectory samples (fig.  1 (c)).
 The proof for a nonconvex f was later given in Chen et al., (2019); Lei et al., (2019).
It has been shown that many NLP tasks can be considered question answering (QA) (Bryan McCann & Socher, 2018).
 A better way to achieve coordination among followers and achieve the leader’s goals is that the manager of the company or the government needs to provide bonuses to followers, like the taxi company pays extra bonuses for serving the customers in rural areas and the government provides subsidies for investing in the poverty areas, which we term as expensive coordination.
 They can be shared and learned across different nodes and even different graphs.
 Therefore, it would be desirable if the training approach is redesigned to make its decision making more transparent, thus providing more information for accurate confidence calibration.
 A comprehensive introduction to mathematical fundamentals of DPP for sampling from a discrete space can be found in Kulesza et al., (2012).
 Nonetheless, the hierarchical clustering structure completely relies on the handcrafted design which needs to be tuned carefully and may lack the capability to capture complex relationships.
 However, there is no black-box learning method for undirected models except the recent work of NVIL (Kuleshov & Ermon, 2017).
 In the hardware perspective, low-precision integer accelerators or processors are dominating the solutions targeted on neural network inference, especially for mobile and embedded scenarios.
 In traditional MIL, given the bags and corresponding bag level labels, task is to learn the mapping between bags and labels while the goal is to predict labels of unseen bags (Dietterich et al., 1997; Foulds & Frank, 2010).
 First, in practical scenarios, the number of tasks that the model should train on may be large.
 This is one way to enable multi-task transfer whilst mitigating catastrophic forgetting, which has proven to be effective (Rusu et al., 2016b; Fernando et al., 2017; Yoon et al., 2018), albeit with limitations.
Figure 1(top) illustrates the feature distribution modeling of a DNN, which is the core mechanism of the attack.
 Machine learning can learn to solve a class of problem instances fast, when test instances are generated from the same distribution as training instances.
 As Figure 2 shows, compared to the layer-wise quantized model, on the same FPGA accelerator (Umuroglu et al., 2019a), the kernel-wise quantized model (assigning a QBN to each weight kernel and choosing a QBN for each activation layer) improves the inference accuracy by ∼ 2% (ImageNet) with the same computing overhead (inference latency).
 In their experiments, the ground truth of the state is the full map plus the location of the agent, which means the representation of the state is explicit.
Towards addressing the aforementioned challenge, we approach the sample-efficient reinforcement learning from a ranking perspective.
We denote random variables using upper-case letters (e.g, X , Y ), and their realizations by the corresponding lower-case letter (e.g, x, y).
 In other cases, an RNN-based policy can overfit to maze-like tasks in exploration (Zhang et al., 2018c), or even exploit determinism and avoid using observations (Bellemare et al., 2012; Machado et al., 2018).
 Transformation-based defenses are desirable as there is no need to retrain the CNN model.
 The first contradiction is that given a fixed number of bits to represent weights, the range and resolution are inversely proportional.
 These algorithms can significantly speed up the vanilla CFR in practice.
 Thus, the well learned DNNs are supposed to converge to similar knowledge representations.
 Some algorithms reduce these artifacts by combining view blending and optical flow correction (Eisemann et al., 2008; Casas et al., 2015; Du et al., 2018), or by combining viewdependent blending with view-specific geometry (Chaurasia et al., 2013; Hedman et al., 2016) or geometry with soft 3D visibility like Penner & Zhang (2017).
 This issue raises serious concerns about using neural network for some security-sensitive tasks (Papernot et al., 2017).
 Therefore, in this paper, we are specifically interested in studying fact verification with semi-structured Wikipedia tables (Bhagavatula et al., 2013)2 as evidences owing to its structured and ubiquitous nature (Jauhar et al., 2016; Zhong et al., 2017; Pasupat & Liang, 2015).
 We provide a detailed discussion of ES in Section 3.1.
 This mechanism allows flexibility to perform universal computations.
 Both of these challenges are exacerbated when planning in visual space.
 NSC is extensively studied and widely applied.
 Methods like those in Achlioptas et al., (2018) therefore use an assignment mechanism to match up elements (section 2), after which a usual reconstruction loss can be computed.
 Based on this intuition, we define a straightforward yet effective method (§4) of drawing constituency trees directly from pretrained LMs with no fine-tuning or addition of task-specific parts, instead resorting to the concept of Syntactic Distance (Shen et al., 2018a;b).
 To this end, we propose to learn a dynamically induced subgraph which starts with a head node and ends with a predicted tail node as shown in Figure 1.
 Yet these methods are not quite reliable since there is no illustration or guarantee on to what extent they can work.
 This suggests that supervised methods – which associate a representation (or a group of representations) zi with a particular ground truth factor yk – may be more adequate.
 In this paper, we formalize and generalize this intuition and make these contributions:
 Due to the computational obstruction, many recent efforts have been devoted to proposing faster verification methods (Wong et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2019) and accelerating AT procedures (Shafahi et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019a).
Incremental learning dynamics have also been explored in gradient descent applied to matrix completion and sensing with a factorized parameterization (Gunasekar et al., (2017), Arora et al., (2018), Woodworth et al., (2019)).
 The intuition behind not accessing the privileged input is twofold: (a) we might want to avoid accessing the privileged input because we want to generalize with respect to it (and therefore compress it) (b) we actually would prefer not to access it (as this input could be costly to obtain).
 To understand how a notion of an arrow of time can be useful in the reinforcement learning context, consider the example of a cleaning robot tasked with moving a box across a room (Amodei et al., 2016).
 It naturally raises an intriguing question for adversarial training:For adversarial training, is it possible to learn the robust local features , which have better adversarially robust generalization and better standard generalization?To address this question, we investigate the relationship between the generalization of adversarial training and the robust local features, and advocate for learning robust local features for adversarial training.
In order to overcome these drawbacks, subsequent research has developed approaches to shed light on the inner workings of CNNs.
 In such datasets, the administered treatment T depends on some or all attributes of individual X – see Figure 1(b).
 Deep covering options discovers a small set of options that encourage exploration by minimizing the agent’s expected cover time—the expected number of steps required to visit every state in the environment (Broder and Karlin, 1989).
Manifold Distribution Hypothesis In deep learning, the manifold distribution hypothesis is well accepted, which assumes the distribution of a specific class of natural data is concentrated on a low dimensional manifold embedded in the high dimensional data space Tenenbaum et al., (2000).
 Mathematically, the key observation is that higher-order interactions between entities can be understood using algebras.
This vision of learning new tasks from a few demonstrations and trials inherently requires some amount of prior knowledge or experience, which we can acquire through meta-learning across a range of previous tasks.
In this paper, we are the first to study adversarial machine learning attacks considering the complete visual perception pipeline in autonomous driving, i.g,, both object detection and object tracking, and discover a novel attack technique, called tracker hijacking, that can effectively fool the MOT process using AEs on object detection.
 These methods do not perform well under high noise ratio as the predictions from DNNs would dominate training and cause overfitting.
 Recently, adversarial training with adversarial examples generated by Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) (Madry et al., 2018) has been demonstrated to be the only method that can train moderately robust DNNs without being fully attacked (Athalye et al., 2018).
We face two significant challenges in the design.
 Furthermore, Nesterov SGD may diverge, even in the linear setting, for step sizes that guarantee convergence of ordinary SGD.
 Since deep networks learn a hierarchy of representations, we further break down this investigation on a per-layer basis.
While human inspection can be used to select good model runs and hyperparameters (e.g, Higgins et al., (2017b, Appendix 5.1)), we argue that such supervision should be made explicit.
 We study parameter transformations which preserve the output behaviour of the network h(z) = WLσ(WL−1σ(.W1z + b1 . ) + bL−1) + bL for all inputs z in some domain Z.
 However, with current approaches, we start having generative models that are able to learn good approximations of the density conveyed by those complex data.
 In particular, it must identify relevant information in the document to shape its policy and accomplish the goal.
 It also cannot guarantee that said network will be able to solve a given task given a particular training procedure, such as stochastic gradient descent.
 Fine-tuning a neural network by a .
∗DeepMind and Stanford University Department of PsychologySeveral automatic-curriculum generating algorithms have been proposed, including some that help agents explore and learn about their environments (e.g, Gregor et al., 2016b; Eysenbach et al., 2018), and some that attempt to gradually increase goal difficulty (e.g, Florensa et al., 2017).
 They propose a probabilistic ensemble to capture model uncertainty, which enables PETS algorithm to achieve both better sample efficiency and better asymptotic performance than state-of-the-art model-free controllers in environments such as Cheetah.
 The key intuition is that s̃ should have a lower value than s, because otherwise s̃ likely should have been visited by the demonstrations in the first place.
 In this continuous limit, the dynamics of TD learning are modeled as a (nonlinear) ODE.
 Consider, for example, the corpus of HuffPost headlines, categorized into 41 classes.
Algorithm 1: SGD with stochastic heavy ball momentum 1: Required: Step size parameter η and momentum parameter β. 2: Init: w0 ∈ Rd and m−1 = 0 ∈ Rd. 3: for t = 0 to T do 4: Given current iterate wt, obtain stochastic gradient gt := ∇f(wt; ξt). 5: Update stochastic momentum mt := βmt−1 + gt. 6: Update iterate wt+1 := wt − ηmt. 7: end forpackages such as PyTorch and Tensorflow.
As a proof of concept, we show the existence of adversarial policies in zero-sum simulated robotics games with proprioceptive observations (Bansal et al., 2018a).
 A central challenge in video prediction is that the future is highly uncertain: a short sequence of observations of the present can imply many possible futures.
 GSTs extract scattering features that can be utilized towards graph learning tasks (Gao et al., 2019), with competitive performance especially when the number of training examples is small.
 In this work, we investigate whether we can further enforce pretrained models to focus on encyclopedic knowledge about real-world entities, so that they can better capture entity information from natural language and be applied to improving entity-related NLP tasks.
Currently, there are two workarounds commonly used by practitioners.
 Instead, we argue that these tasks (branch-prediction and prefetching) jointly model the intermediate behavior of a program as it executes.
 Furthermore, the trade-off between two (somewhat conflicting) goals, i.g,, high accuracy and low latency, also makes the search process unstable and prone to “bad local minima” architecture options.
 A state-of-the-art approach is the so-called generative adversarial network (GAN) Goodfellow et al., (2014).
 This naturally motivates the following question:How to design stochastic algorithms with provable guarantees to solve the AUC maximization problem with a deep neural network as the predictive model?In this paper, we make some efforts to answer this question.
 As a result, adversarial training runs very slowly.
 These sub-networks, first proposed by Sabour et al., (2017) as part of a Capsule Network (CapsNet), allow a model to produce a reconstruction of its input based on the identity and instantiation parameters of the winning capsule.
 Overall, current solutions are mostly heuristic approaches that cannot provide performance guarantees to the adversary they considered.
 In this case, RNNs need to tackle two problems simultaneously (Lee et al., 2019): learning representation (encoded by hidden states of the RNN) of the underlying states of the environment from the state-transition data, and learning to maximize returns using the learned representation.
 However, this resetting method has the problem that the search area covered by all N policies in the population collapses to one point at the time of parameter copying and thus the search area can be narrow around the previous best policy point.
 Among the properties of natural language, compositionality is considered to be critical, because it enables representation of complex concepts through the combinination of several simple ones.
 Thus, it is natural to combine the two black-box attack approaches, so that we can take advantage of a pretrained white-box source neural network to perform more efficient search to attack an unknown target black-box model.
 Specifically, Recht et al., (2019) found that a minute natural distribution shift leads to a large drop in accuracy for a broad range of image classifiers on both CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky, 2009) and ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), suggesting that the current test sets may be far from sufficient to represent hard natural images encountered in the real world.
We conduct experiments empirically validating the effectiveness of the proposed mixout(wpre) where wpre denotes a pretrained model parameter.
 The emphasis is on the number of calls needed to estimate the Q value or to output a near-optimal policy.
 We show that learning D improves the performance of a scatteringrepresentation considerably and is sufficient to reach a higher accuracy than AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) over ImageNet 2012.
 Hence, these methods are vulnerable to adversarial attacks (Szegedy et al., 2014), which design inputs that do not follow these statistics.
 From optimization perspective, the descent path property favors descent optimization algorithms like the pure gradient descent (GD) method.
 †Bohan Wang is also affiliated with University of Science and Technology of China.
In this study, we make the following contributions:
 Thus, it directly determines the overall training time.
 However, all these ∗Equal contribution, † corresponding authorworks ignore the natural property of the action influence between agents, which we aim to exploit to facilitate multiagent coordination.
 Given a user-defined trajectory, a realistic video of the character, placed in front of an arbitrary background, is generated.
 Based on these two observations, we hypothesize that out of small-loss examples, training losses of noisy examples would increase by injecting certain perturbation to network parameters, while those of clean examples would not.
 A normalizing flow is a transformation of a simple probability distribution (e.g, a standard normal) into a more complex probability distribution by a composition of a series of invertible and differentiable mappings (Kobyzev et al., 2019).
 To bridge this gap, we study certified robustness for top-k predictions in this work.
 Instead, to benefit exploration, we require the Q-values for novel state-action pairs must remain high until they are explored.
In the various network architectures designed for different visual-linguistic tasks, a key goal is to effectively aggregate the multi-modal information in both the visual and linguistic domains.
 A basic idea is to spatially recompose data towards a common mode such that semantic recognition suffers less from deformation.
 Mismatch between the test and training distributions is also known as a dataset shift (Quiñonero-Candela, 2009), and is a situation which often arises for real world problems.
In asynchronous SGD (ASGD), each worker communicates independently of the others, thereby addressing the major drawback of SSGD.
 First, the Euclidean architecture cannot represent asymmetric metrics, which arise naturally in directed graphs and reinforcement learning.
 While the error landscape seems fairly complex at first glance, we observe the emergence of several key characteristics shared across benchmarks and domains.
Learning semantic parsers from denotations is difficult because the end-to-end process to be learned includes a non-differentiable operation—i.g,, reasoning with the symbolic KB that contains the answers.
 In principle, neural networks are well suited to this task because they can act as universal function∗Co-student leads listed in alphabetical order; each contributed equally.
Paradoxically, the huge effort invested in finding better search spaces and training protocols, has led to a situation in which any randomly sampled architecture performs almost as well as those obtained by the search strategies.
 Such architectural design enables the model to simultaneously exploit the ability of convolutional units to model spatial relationships and the potential of recurrent units to capture temporal dependencies.
 However, whereas LTR and ordinal regression assume that ranks form a total order (Hrbacek & Jech, 1984), order learning can be used for a partial order as well.
A typical example of logical reasoning questions is shown in Table 1.
 One example of such problematicbehaviour can be seen in Figure 1.
 An implementation is available at github to strike an unsatisfying compromise between sample quality and reconstruction quality.
 The ERF of image classification task can be easily fulfilled, e.g, the input size is 224×224 for the ImageNet data, while the ERF of object detection task need more capacities to handle scale variance across the instances, e.g, the input size is 800×1333 and the sizes of objects vary from 32 to 800 for the COCO dataset.
 However, this means that this validation set has to be carefully crafted to encompass as many potential failure cases as possible.
 Given their appeal, an ever increasing number of GNNs is being developed (Gilmer et al., 2017).
Convolutional layers are used in all competitive deep neural network architectures applied to image processing tasks.
 These variants are equipped with data-dependent regret bounds, which are O( √ T ) in the worst case and become tighter when gradients are sparse 1.∗Lijun Zhang is the corresponding author.
 Consequently, CL systems for non-stationary data require adaptation methods, which deliberately forget outdated information.
Our contributions are thus:
Our work: Motivated by the aforementioned observations and challenges, our method does the following.
 Specifically, it learns a policy by fitting a regression model over expert demonstrations, which directly maps states to actions.
 This means that the part of the model transferred from the pre-trained model is known to potential attackers.
 The key idea is to make parameters that rely on knowledge-grounded dialogues small and independent by disentangling the response decoder, and thus we can learn the major part of the generation model from ungrounded dialogues and plain text that are much easier to acquire.
 In particular, our attention layers receive as input the constituency tree of a piece of text and then model the hidden states of all nodes in the tree (leaves and nonterminals) from their lower-layer representations according to the tree structure.
 Moreover, if the aggregated effect of the population corresponds to the Nash equilibrium, then the optimal policy of each agent jointly constitutes a Nash equilibrium.
 Finally, certification techniques work with relaxation of the original problem and might not be able to certify robust inputs.
 Several authors (Li et al., 2017; Bińkowski et al., 2018a) suggest that a reason is that MMD is sensitive to the choice of kernel.
The outputs of a set of properties can be concatenated into a vector, yielding a representation that we call a property signature.
 Thus TSN is a video-level representation learning framework.
 Thanks to explicit optimization, fractional increase in bitrate is sufficient to significantly increase the detection accuracy.

 While such distances can be learned using standard model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Q-learning, we show that such methods generally struggle to acquire meaningful distances for more complex systems, particularly with high-dimensional observations such as images.
 Evaluation of the meta-learner (during a phase called meta-testing) is also carried out in episodes in a similar fashion, except that the meta-learner is no longer updated and the performance on query data across multiple episodes is aggregated.
 Because our interaction interpretation method is very general, we also show that the interpretations are informative in other domains: text, image, graph, and dna modeling.
To mitigate these issues, we propose a unified perspective over variational estimators treating variational MI estimation as an optimization problem over (valid) density ratios.
 That this is necessary can be seen from the physiology of the eye, where the small portion of the visual field that can produce sharp images (fovea centralis) motivates the need for rapid eye movements (saccades) to build up a crisp and holistic percept of a scene (Wandell, 1995).
 Although the diversity of the generative images is significantly improved, these methods experience drawbacks.
 Most recently, work has focused on using backpropagation with∗corresponding author sesser@us.ibm.comstochastic gradient descent to learn a quantizer that minimizes task loss (Zhu et al., 2016; Mishra & Marr, 2017; Choi et al., 2018b;a; Jung et al., 2018; Baskin et al., 2018; Polino et al., 2018).
 By moving in some direction of GAN latent space, can we hallucinate walking toward this dog? As the figure indicates, and as we will show in this paper, the answer is yes.
 This is specially relevant when we want to collect annotated data with a human in the loop to create a new dataset or to add more labeled data to an existing one.
 In this paper, we take a different tact and reduce the central problem to just estimating the signs of the gradients.
 This leads to a semi-supervised AD problem: given n (mostly normal but possibly containing some anomalous contamination) unlabeled samples x1, . ,xn and m labeled samples (x̃1, ỹ1), . , (x̃m, ỹm), where ỹ = +1 and ỹ = −1 denote normal and anomalous samples respectively, the task is to learn a model that compactly characterizes the “normal class.”The term semi-supervised anomaly detection has been used to describe two different AD settings.
Instead of asking “what is the best performance one can achieve given this data and algorithm?”, which has been the primary focus in the field so far, we decorate this question with budgeted training constraints as follows: “what is the best performance one can achieve given this data and algorithm within the allowed budget?”.
 As a seminal instance, Jeong and Song (2018) propose an end-to-end approach to learn∗Part of the work was done when BP was a research intern at Snap Inc.
 Due to the finite-sample nature of such a problem, stochastic variance reduction techniques for conventional optimization can be directly applied here to reduce the variance.
 Then, these density ratios are used as rewards for a standard RL algorithm, and the behavior policy is updated to maximize these cumulative rewards (data distribution ratios).
 Does the meta-initialization learned by the outer loop result in rapid learning on unseen test tasks (efficient but significant changes in the representations) or is the success primarily due to feature reuse (with the meta-initialization already providing high quality representations)? In this paper, we explore this question and its many surprising consequences.
 By introducing machine learning (ML) techniques, the long term behaviour is not subject to stagnation, thus solving a significant problem in genetic algorithms (Paszkowicz, 2009).
 These complications arise because for deep nets, it is unclear how to properly normalize the output1This is a stronger version of the classical textbook bound which involves the min margin on the training examples.
 Our work shows that, while the above may be factors, a primary factor is the use of the likelihood objective itself, as we demonstrate that degeneration is alleviated if we replace the likelihood objective with our proposal.
 In order to be of practical use for control, it is not enough for the models to discover latent attributes, they need to do so reliably and in a way that is robust to random initialization and to changes in the model.
 Given a trained model, our method returns an extrapolation score that measures the variability of test predictions across a local ensemble, i.g,a set of local perturbations of the trained model parameters that fit the training data equally well.
 We also show that mode connectivity analysis reveals the existence of a robustness loss barrier on the path connecting regular and adversarially-trained models.
 Thus, it is not sufficient to learn a well-performing φ; it is equally imperative to ensure that a task’s sensitive information is not obtainable by anyone else.
 Albeit harder than Omniglot, it has the same property that most recent methods trained on it present similar accuracy when controlling for model capacity.
 In BERT, the scoring function f is a pre-trained deep bidirectional Transformer model.
 The key drawback is that these models learn dynamics of possible behavior rather than dynamics of desirable behavior.
Given these open challenges, our paper focuses on the cooperative multi-goal multi-agent setting where each agent is assigned a goal1 and must learn to cooperate with other agents with possibly different goals.
 More recently, Cheng et al., (2019) showed that finding the minimum adversarial perturbation in the hard-label setting can be reformulated as another optimization problem (we call this Cheng’s formulation in this paper).
 Also, we notice that current approaches rely on greedy sampling that neglects the distribution of the candidate solutions (configurations).
 These surround neural populations compete to influence encodings of the central grating: suppression predominates when center/surround are similar, and facilitation predominates when center/surround are dissimilar.
 Overall, our results support the hypothesis that compositionality and locality are crucial principles for training models that generalize well.
 Most work was done during Chunting’s internship at FAIR.
 Leveraging the power of FL in aggregating dispersed information from local parties to train a shared model, in this paper we propose distributed backdoor attack (DBA) against FL.
 QNNs, like BNNs, face challenges in training, though for different reasons: (4.1) The non-differentiable activation function is not amenable to backpropagation.
In this work we identify four techniques that everyone should know to improve their usage of Batch Normalization, arguably the most common method for normalization in neural networks.
 The basic idea behind these algorithms is to approximate gradients via ZO oracle (Nesterov & Spokoiny, 2017; Ghadimi & Lan, 2013).
 Over the last few years, a large number of works have proposed training virtual robots (or ‘embodied agents’) in rich 3D simulators before transferring the learned skills to reality (Beattie∗Work done while an intern at Facebook AI Research.
The key insight is that in the temperature scaling approach, only a single parameter τ is fit to the validation data—thus, unlike fitting the original neural network, the temperature scaling algorithm comes with generalization guarantees based on traditional statistical learning theory.
 However, static DNN quantization methods cannot exploit input-dependent characteristics, where certain features can be computed in a lower precision during inference as they contribute less to the classification result for the given input.
the ambiguity and variability of real-world text while performing a diverse range of reasoning.
 There are two key ideas that distinguish HOF from prior work in 3D object representation learning: fast-weights object encoding and interpolation through function composition.
 We refer to this new modeling framework as VHE randomized GAN (VHE-GAN).
 Another solution (S2) is to borrow architecture from the ones searched on other tasks but it might be not optimal for the new task.
 Prior works have shown how using knowledge graphs aid in the twin issues of partial observability (Ammanabrolu & Riedl, 2019a) and commonsense reasoning (Ammanabrolu & Riedl, 2019b), but do not use them in the context of generating natural language.
 There have been two main approaches to this problem: 1) to start by defining a cost function in the high-dimensional observation space and learn the embedding space, its dynamics, and reward function, by interacting with the environment in a RL fashion (Hafner et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019), and 2) to first learn the embedding space and its dynamics, and then define a cost function in this low-dimensional space and conduct the control (Watter et al., 2015; Banijamali et al., 2018).
 We call this approach neural graph algorithm execution.
In this paper, we propose a novel representation of filters, termed Filter Summary (FS), which enforces weight sharing across filters so as to achieve model compression.
There has been extensive research on embedding Knowledge Graphs (KG) (Nickel et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017) where representations of both nodes and relations are jointly learned.
We propose a score-based method (Koller & Friedman, 2009) for structure learning named GraNDAG which makes use of a recent reformulation of the original combinatorial problem of finding an optimal DAG into a continuous constrained optimization problem.
 Thus, at a high level, local elasticity must be inherently related1This property also holds for the 1-nearest neighbors algorithm.
 If not, it fits each example on a case-by-case basis.
 This allows∗1DeepMind, London, UK. 2 CoMPLEX, University College London, London, UK. 3 Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London, London, UK. Correspondece should be sent to abanino@google.
 The time cost is caused by two major components: length of dialogue history i.g,number of turns, and length of slot values.
 In passing, note that recent RNN works that draw inspiration from ODE’s (Chang et al., 2019) are special cases of CTRNN (τ = 1, α = 0).Vanishing Gradients.
 This observation suggests that the changes in the network during this initial phase are vital for the success of the training of small, sparse sub-networks.
 †Corresponding author.
 Under this scheme, agents can have good collaborative behaviors close to that in a centralized setting.
 Likewise, ANNs trained on unperturbed images exhibit reduced performance when images in the test set are distorted, for example, through horizontal translations, blurring, or the addition of compression artifacts (Dodge & Karam (2016); Vasiljevic et al., (2016); Zhou et al., (2017)).
 More recently, Bartlett et al., (2019); Arora et al., (2019a); Shamir (2018); Du & Hu (2019) analyzed the optimization trajectory ofGD for training deep linear networks and proved global convergence rates under certain assumptions on the training data, initialization, and neural network structure.
 Similarly, socio-economic data can often be grouped together by geographic proximity.
However, self-training has not been studied extensively when the target output is natural language.
 The complexity of the models and the curse of dimensionality hinder this approach for highly multivariate data, such as friendship networks and recommender systems with millions of users.
 Finally, these techniques can produce inconsistent results in that they may predict different types for different token-level occurrences of the same variable.
 More specifically, we adopted conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) (Mirza & Osindero, 2014; Miyato & Koyama, 2018) so that the generator network can produce a face image that is dependent not only on the paired speech condition, but also on the stochastic variable.
 Our models are trained to predict views of static scenes given 2.5D (color and depth; RGB-D) video streams as input, and are evaluated on their ability to detect objects in 3D.
Most aforementioned approaches thus learn the classifiers used for recognition jointly with the data representations.
It is desirable to train agents that are agnostic to environment perturbations.
Bayesian approaches to neural networks (MacKay, 1992b) can potentially avoid some of the pitfalls of explicit parameterization of importance in regular neural networks.
Robustness of 0-1 loss: The problem resulted from data corruption or label corruption is that test distribution is different from training distribution.
 Only the final model parameters and statistics are gathered and made available to the modeler.
 A further study confirms that deep ensembles generally∗Partial work done as part of the Google Student Researcher Program achieves the best performance on out-of-distribution uncertainty benchmarks (Ovadia et al., 2019; Gustafsson et al., 2019) compared to other methods such as MC-dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2015).
TP shares the idea with Contrastive Hebbian Learning of propagating target activities instead of errors.
 Seo & Liu (2019) proposed a physics-informed regularizer to impose dataspecific physics equations.
 The contributions of this paper are as follows:
 The objective becomes maximizing the expected rewards of model generated sequences.
 For example, why does applying a gradient penalty together spectral norm seem to improve performance (Miyato et al., 2018), even though in principle they serve the same purpose? Why does applying only spectral normalization with the Wasserstein loss fail (Miyato, 2018), even though the analysis of Arjovsky et al., (2017) suggests it should be sufficient? Why is applying gradient penalties effective, even outside their original context of the Wasserstein GAN (Fedus et al., 2018)?In this work, we develop a framework to analyze the stability of GAN training that resolves these apparent contradictions and clarifies the roles of these regularization techniques.
 Table 1 compares SNOW with prior arts in transfer/lifelong learning, and fig.  1 visualizes the key structural differences between SNOW and transfer/lifelong learning where the source model for task0 is leveraged to build the target models for task1-3 without persistent datasets as follows:FOa FEb FTc MPd LFe PNf SNOW Overall Accuracy poor medium good good medium good goodCatastrophic forgetting no no no no yes no no Training efficiency good good poor poor poor poor good Serving efficiency good good poor poor good poor good Model-size efficiency good good poor good good poor good a Final output only: re-training the final output layer of the duplicated source model (Yosinski et al., 2014).
To address this challenge, Liu et al., (2018) proposed to solve an optimization problem of a minimax nature, whose solution directly estimates the desired propensity score of states under the stationary distribution, avoiding an explicit dependence on horizon.
 In this work, we address the oversmoothing problem in deep GNNs.
As a step towards a theoretical understanding of the generalization phenomenon for overparameterized neural networks when noisy labels are present, this paper proposes and analyzes two simple regularization methods as alternatives of early stopping:
 On the other hand, the size of an object or its position are described by Continuous factors of variations, expressed in a range of possible values.
 Furthermore, learning a physically-consistent model of the underlying dynamics can subsequently enable usage of model-based controllers which can provide performance guarantees for complex, nonlinear systems.
functions are indeed sparsity-promoting, the resulting optimization problems must be solved one row at a time, hence resulting as many optimization problems as the ambient dimension n.
2 The literature also contains some unsupervised methods, but they typically have limited accuracy (Kim et al., 2011; Kolter & Jaakkola, 2012; Johnson & Willsky, 2013; Parson et al., 2014; Wytock & Kolter, 2014; Zhao et al., 2016; Lange & Berges, 2018).
 In practice, kernel machines with the NTK have been experimentally demonstrated to yield competitive results on large-scale tasks such as image classification on CIFAR-10; yet there is still a non-neglible per-formance gap between NTK and full training on the same convolutional architecture (Arora et al., 2019a; Lee et al., 2019).
Function approximation can be used to replace the tabular representation.
 To achieve this, we start by using an existing synthesizer to find a candidate program p1 that satisfies all examples in I.
 To reduce correlation, the decision trees must be in different shapes, and the strength of individual trees would not be as high as the best decision tree.
 However, the default setting is not necessarily optimal for fine-tuning on other tasks.
 RL & JL built and oversaw the human evaluation pipeline and computed the statistics.
 For most of the methods, 3D annotations suchas ground truth 3D models (Choy et al., 2016; Fan et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018), multiple-view images (Yan et al., 2016), or silhouette annotations of objects (Yan et al., 2016; Kato et al., 2018; Kato & Harada, 2019) must be used to reconstruct 3D shape from 2D images.
In this work, we address the under-sensitivity issue by designing and formally verifying the undersensitivity specification that a model should not become more confident as arbitrary subsets of input words are deleted.
 It is shown in theory that the saliency in Jacobian is a result of robustness (Etmann et al., 2019).
 To compound the problem, many algorithms report results using different models for different number of ways (classes) and shots (number of labeled samples per class), with aggressive hyper-parameter optimization.
 Lecuyer et al., (2019) showed that verifying the robustness of this smoothed classifier is significantly simpler than verifying the original classifier h and only requires estimating the distribution of outputs of the classifier under random perturbations of the input, but does not require access to the internals of the classifier h.
 Then the original KD objective function, ψ, has the fully factored form: ψ(yS ,yT ) = ∑ i φi(y S i ,y T i ) ∗.
 In order to remove the dependence on human annotations, the second category of methods leverages reinforcement learning to autonomously discover simplifying equivalence (Chen et al., 2018).
In this paper, we propose an efficient data augmentation method to address the problems mentioned above, which can directly search the best augmentation policy on the full dataset during training a target network, as shown in Figure 1.
To solve this seemingly impossible problem, we resort to meta-learning (Thrun & Pratt, 1998) which aims to learn a model that generalize over a distribution of tasks, rather than a distribution of data instances from a single task.
 In simpler words, disparate treatment is intentionaldiscrimination against a protected group, while the disparate impact is an unintentional disproportionate outcome that hurts a protected group.
 The mapping is optimal in the sense that among all reasonable mappings (precisely defined in Section 2), it minimizes the cost of aligning the two datasets.
Let’s assume we have a large network that consists of B expensive convolutional blocks, and a candidate pool of C cheap blocks that we could substitute each of these out for, and we are given a limit on the number of parameters (and therefore memory) that the network can use.
 As a consequence, studies utilizing public data often resort to simulating label noise.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework for weakly supervised disentanglement, and evaluate our framework on several datasets.
 More specifically, lower complexity should often imply smaller generalization gap.
However, most of existing verification methods focus on relatively simple neural network architectures, such as feed-forward and recurrent neural networks, while they cannot handle complex structures.
 Sannai et al., (2019) builds a universal equivariant network by taking n copies of (n− 1)-invariant networks and combines them with a layer that is not permutation invariant in the standard (above mentioned) sense.
 In local SGD, each worker k P rKs evolves a local model by performing H sequential SGD updates with mini-batch size Bloc, before communication (synchronization by averaging) among the workers.
 Without paired data, directly solving this is impossible but on a distribution level it is easily seen if G solves eq. (1) then the distribution of G(x) as x is sampled from X is equal to that of Y .
In this paper, we propose Follow-the-Ridge (FR), an algorithm for minimax optimization that addresses both issues.
 On the other hand, the expansion methods are different from the two approaches in that it can expand the model architecture to accommodate new data instead of fixing it beforehand.
Confirmation bias has seemingly appeared to thwart recent efforts to bring node embeddings and structural representations into a single overarching framework.
 Moreover, since probabilities are not calibrated, when classifying triples (i.g, facts) as true or false, users must define relationspecific thresholds, which can be awkward for graphs with a great number of relation types.
 This might be partially true for users of some sparsity levels, but it is not a common case uniformly applicable for a wider range of sparsity levels.
 As first introduced by Li et al., (2018a) and further explained in Wu et al., (2019); Xu et al., (2018a); Klicpera et al., (2019), graph convolutions essentially push representations of adjacent nodes mixed with each other, such that, if extremely we go with an infinite number of layers, all nodes’ representations will converge to a stationary point, making them unrelated to the input features and leading to vanishing gradients.
 The network structure or hyper-parameter setting needs to be adjusted for the specific dataset.
 This often limits practical applications of deep learning.
 Hence, one can improve generalization by discarding all the information not shared by both views from the representation.
Gitthe deep learning hypothesis as a promising alternative: reducing the need for expert knowledge in lieu of large datasets and end-to-end optimization of neural networks.
 Particularly, a differentially private learning algorithm is stable in the sense that the model learned by the algorithm is insensitive to the removal or replacement of an arbitrary point in the training dataset (Bousquet & Elisseeff 2002).
As scheduling and placement are just a few of the many complex decisions made in a compiler, it is essential in a production setting that a solution 1) produce solutions of acceptable quality fast, even on large graphs (e.g, thousands of nodes) and decision spaces, and 2) handle diverse graphs from various types of applications, neural network architectures, and users.
 Consequently, past end-to-end learning work for exploration from Chen et al., (2019) relies on use of imitation learning and many millions of frames of experience, but still performs worse than classical methods that don’t require any training at all.
 Each of these approaches, albeit promising, has limitations with respect to the kind of attacks they can defend against, the increase in training complexity, as well as their effect on the model’s accuracy on the original unperturbed inputs.
Representing low-level features via features maps on groups, as is done in G-CNNs, is also motivated by the findings of Hubel & Wiesel (1959) and Bosking et al., (1997) on the organization of orientation sensitive simple cells in the primary visual cortex V1.
 Previous work (Huang et al., 2016) has shown that dropping layers during training can regularize and reduce the training time of very deep convolutional networks.
 †This work was done while the author was a student at the University of Pennsylvania.
 Also, since it does not explicitly reflect useful inductive biases like the locality of an object in the Gestalt principles (Koffka, 2013),∗Visiting Student at Rutgers University.
 In a nutshell, they can be characterized by having one of the following properties (i-iv).
In this paper, we explore the combination of the best of both worlds, aiming for a method which is data-driven yet can still exploit the prior knowledge encoded in logic rules.
This paper presents an infinite-horizon differentiable linear quadratic MPC that can be learned using gradient-based methods.
 We study two different scenarios: firstly, (i) training on a challenging peer-to-peer setting, where the training data is distributed over the training devices (and not allowed to move), similar to the federated learning setting (McMahan et al., 2017).
 Their goal was to efficiently and effectively find catastrophic failure given a trained agent and to predict its failure probability.
 Interestingly, Ramachandran et al., (2019) noticed that, even though state-of-the art results are reached when attention and convolutional features are combined, under same computation and model size constraints, self-attention-only architectures also reach competitive image classification accuracy.
 On leave from College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology.
In this meta-learning setting, our objective is to find a curiosity module that works well given a distribution of environments from which we can sample at meta-learning time.
2.Partial observability forces the use of memory, and also reduces the generality of information provided by a single demonstration, since trajectories cannot be broken into isolated transitions using the Markov property.
 In fact,1To distinguish from testing and training within a task, meta-testing and meta-training are referred to as testing and training over tasks.
Outlier detection in the above settings is substantially different from general out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, where the goal is to use unconditional generative models to detect any OOD input.
 Conversely, a generative model can be trained to generate an image given input class and content information.
 VAEs provide a way to sidestep the intractability of marginalizing a joint probability model of the input and latent space p(x, z), while allowing for a prior p(z) on the latent space.
 Our method updates the policy’s parameters using sequences x generated by the current policy πθ(x), but evaluated using a learned surrogate f ′(x), instead of the true, but unknown, oracle reward function f(x).
 However, this type of method requires the availability of the original training data or large query data to train the substitute network and the performance is often limited by the mismatch between the substitute and the target models (Su et al., 2018).
 Take, for example, the task of making a breakfast in Figure 1.
 This procedure does not need additional training of the autoencoder.
 The two main challenges: to build effective convolution stencils and to evolve learned nonlinear features (Qi et al., 2016a; xingzhe.
 Recently, word ordering was treated as LM-based linearization solely based on language models (Schmaltz et al., 2016).
 However, we show that due to the architectural discrepancies between the real and the binary networks, a direct application of teacher-student produces sub-optimal performance.
 To get a sense of how I(Y ;Z) and I(X;Z) vary with β, we train Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) models (Alemi et al., 2016) on the CIFAR10 dataset (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009), where each experiment is at a different β and random initialization of the model. fig.  1 shows the I(X;Z), I(Y ;Z) and accuracy vs. β, as well as I(Y ;Z) vs. I(X;Z) for CIFAR10 with 20% label noise (see Appendix I for details).
However, the proposed search spaces generally have only a small set of choices for each block.
 Another closely related work is the Information Bottleneck method (Tishby et al., 2000; Alemi et al., 2017), where MI is used to limit the contents of representations.
 Although it can effectively reduce both model size and computation, it also weakens the model capacity capturing the long and short distance relationship at the same time.
 But if complexity is actually controlled by the norm of the weights, and thus our true model class is defined by the magnitude of the weights, we should instead ask how large a norm is necessary in order to capture a target function.
 Perturbing an input towards its adversarial direction changes the network’s output the most.
Humans learn language by leveraging systematic compositionality, the algebraic capacity to understand and produce large amount of novel combinations from known components (Chomsky, 1957; Montague, 1970).
We are interested in the imitation learning problem under a relaxed assumption: Given an imitator that shares the same state space with the expert but their dynamics may be different, we train the imitator to follow the state sequence in expert demonstrations as much as possible.
 These networks usually have large receptive fields that cover the whole input shape, so that global context can be leveraged to improve the recognition of part semantics and shape structures.
 Xiao et al., (2018b) directly manipulated spatial pixel flow of an image to produce adversarial examples without Lp bounded constraints on the perturbation.
 Roth et al., (2017) propose to directly regularize the squared gradient norm for both the training data and the generated data.
 Re-using many parts of the proof, a nearly-optimal rate 1/δ2d is exhibited for ReLU networks in Theorem E.1; this gap between ReLU networks and their NTK poses a tantalizing gap for future work.
 Although SQAIR provides promising ideas and shows the potential of this important direction, a few key challenges remain, limiting its applicability merely to synthetic toy tasks that are far simpler than typical natural scenes.
 Since detection makes strong assumptions on the attacker’s query distribution (e.g, small L2 distances between successive queries), our focus is on the more popular perturbation-based defenses.
 This enables the network to automatically adapt to situations where, for example, one domain depicts simpler images, such as synthetic ones, which may not need as much processing power as those coming from more complex domains, such as images taken in-the-wild.
Currently, most deep learning approaches that predict poses or rigid-body motions suffer from at least one of three drawbacks: 1) they do not model the uncertainty at all and merely focus on the accuracy of the predicted pose, 2) they make simplifying assumptions not taking into account that the orientation is defined on a periodic manifold, making the approachonly suitable in low-noise regimes, or 3) even when trying to account for periodicity, no dependency is assumed between the orientation axes and usually an Euler angle-based representation is required.
 Since ordinary CNNs must learn such rotated copies independently, they effectively utilize an important number of network parameters suboptimally to this end (see fig.  3 in Krizhevsky et al., (2012)).
 Therefore, STE based methods are more popular in practice.
 If negative samples were harder to discriminate from positive ones, a learning algorithm would obtain a better gradient signal close to the optimum.
 However, the discrete nature of this benchmark does not∗Equal contributionallow to directly benchmark one-shot NAS optimizers (Pham et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2019).
 Moreover, deep ensembles can give overconfident uncertainty estimates in practice.
 They identified stability as a necessary condition and proved that stable recurrent neural networks are well approximated by feed-forward networks for the purpose of both inference and training by gradient descent.
 After obtaining these details, an attacker can train a functioning model, even on a different data set, and still benefit from the stolen DL system (So et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019).
 But, SNNs obtained through conversion incur large latency of 2000−2500 time steps (measured as total number of time steps required to process a given input image2).
 The resulting attacks produce a “spoofed” certificate with a seemingly strong security guarantee despite being adversarially manipulated.
 These monotonic attention approaches also provide a closed-form expression for the expected alignment between source and target tokens.
 The design of our linear model stems from the recent advances in the theoretical analysis of deep models.
Intuitively, the responsibility of transfer learning is to preserve the source knowledge acquired by important neurons.
 Deep neural∗Kailun Wu and Yiwen Guo contribute equally to the paper.
Code is available at github.
However, one of the most difficult obstacles for supervised learning on graphs is that it is often very costly or even impossible to collect annotated labels.
 Although these techniques are effective, they (as well as white-box methods) all treat the entire network (either the target model or the surrogate model) as a single component while ignore its inner architectural characteristics.
 The current situation of introducing visual information results in a bottleneck in the multimodal NMT and is not feasible for text-only NMT and low-resource NMT.
To alleviate the domain shift issue, numerous unsupervised domain adaptation techniques have been proposed (Pan & Yang, 2010; Chen et al., 2018; Tzeng et al., 2017).
 The term ‘plasticity’ is used analogously to ‘neural plasticity’ in the human brain, which refers to the ability of the neurons to change their synaptic weights.
 To escape such inherent trade-off, other notions of fairness, such as equalized odds (Hardt et al., 2016), which asks for equal false positive and negative rates across groups, and accuracy parity (Zafar et al., 2017), which seeks equalized error rates across groups, have been proposed.
 Unfortunately, the inefficiency is quadrupled when the return of the forklift and the retrieval of the pallet are considered.
 We call such GNNs aggregate-combine GNNs,or AC-GNNs.
 We investigate noise in the mini-batch gradients using the covariance of gradients,1 and the local curvature of the loss surface using the Hessian.

 This approach is known as asynchronous centralized training with a parameter server (PS) that updates the parameters (Li, 2014).
 The important latent variables are organically separated from noise variables by the estimating model.
Ideally, these problems should be addressed with a universal representation for structured linear maps: (i) Such a parameterization should be expressive enough to capture important classes of structure, with a nearly tight parameter count and runtime: the space required to represent the linear map should be close to optimal, and the resulting algorithm for matrix vector multiplication should be close to the fastest possible algorithm.
 Notably, the latest series of works (Frankle & Carbin, 2019; Liu et al., 2018b) reveals that dense, randomly-initialized networks contain small subnetworks which can match the test accuracy of original networks when trained alone themselves.
 We focus on the following important theoretical issues:
 For instance, GCN simply sums the normalized “messages” from all one-hop neighbors (Kipf & Welling, 2017).
 One important example is off-policy policy evaluation in RL, where we wish to estimate the value of a policy different from that used to collect experience.
Second, unlike the traditional distributed learning systems, the FL system does not have control over users’ devices.

 Bounding methods compute bounds of each subspace to tighten the bounds of the final objective function over the whole search space.
Intuitively, in the lowermost layer, the first gating step scales the input embedding (itself a representation of the average context in which the token occurs) depending on the actual context, resulting in a contextualized representation of the input.
 Figure 1 illustrates an overview of the architecture, where the logits of a classifier are re-interpreted to define the joint density of data points and labels and the density of data points alone.
 Thus, it is reasonable to expect the structured dynamic to impose a structure on the Q-value.
Overall, our results demonstrate that the motivating theoretical framework for deep RL algorithms is often unpredictive of phenomena arising in practice.
To this end, we propose a novel Bayesian meta-learning framework, which we refer to as Bayesian Task-Adaptive Meta-Learning (Bayesian TAML), that learns variables to adaptively balance the effect of meta- and task-specific learning.
 Most existing methods assume the secondary structure is a result of energy minimization, i.g,, A\\u2217 = argminAEx(A).
 If our memory use was only per-layer, then we should fairly easily fit a large Transformer even on sequences of length 64K on a single accelerator.
 This involves several challenges.

 In this paper, we explore raw waveform generation with GANs, and demonstrate that adversarially trained feed-forward generators are indeed able to synthesise high-fidelity speech audio.
 Unfortunately, current NP models must learn this structure from the data set instead, which is sample and parameter inefficient as well as impacting the ability of the models to generalize.
 Our optimization works as follows: (i) to certify a property (e.g, robustness) of the network, the verifier produces a convex relaxation of all possible intermediate vector outputs in the neural network, then (ii) an adversary now searches over this (intermediate) convex region in order to find, what we refer to as a latent adversarial example – a concrete intermediate input contained in the relaxation that when propagated through the network causes a misclassification which prevents verification, and finally (iii) the resulting latent adversarial examples are now incorporated into our training schemeusing adversarial training.
 Code is available at github, given NN, there are many variants of it that only differ in the ordering of parameters.
 With those intuitions in mind, we summarize our proposed method in broad strokes.
 For example, de-mixing hand written digits is challenging, but it becomes more feasible when we reason about the prior knowledge concerning the two overlapping Sudokus.
 However, note that, unlike solving common stochastic optimization problems, randomly sampling one inner function and one outer function does not give an unbiased estimate for the true gradient; that is, Ei∼n,j∼n(∂Gj(x))T∂Fi(G̃(x)) 6= ∇f(x), where G̃(x)is the estimation of G(x).
 Also, Beise et al., (2018) showed that the decision regions of DNNs with width smaller than the input dimension are unbounded.
 It has been recently reported that spatial structure as inductive bias can improve the performance on these tasks.
 Moreover, the search for adversarial examples is customarily restricted to uniformly-bounded regions or conducted along suboptimal gradient directions (Szegedy et al., 2014; Kurakin et al., 2016; Goodfellow et al., 2014b).
 However, it is challenging to select and train reliable auxiliary models in practice (Li et al., 2017; Malach & Shalev-Shwartz, 2017; Jiang et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2018; Han et al., 2018b).
 Ironically, the increased representational capacity is eventually reduced in practice by the use of explicit regularization, most commonly weight decay and dropout.

In this paper, we propose Group-Connected Multiplayer Perceptron (GMLP) networks.
 They can be used to identify systematic failure cases (e.g, by seeking common trends in input dependence for failure cases), detect biases (e.g, by quantifying feature importance for a particular variable), and provide actionable feedback to improve a model (e.g, understand failure cases and what training data to collect).
 Instead of treating all data samples equally, lower priority can be assigned for a datum to obtain a higher performance model – for example in the following scenarios:1. Incorrect label (e.g, human labeling errors).2. Input comes from a different distribution (e.g, different location or time).3. Input is noisy or low quality (e.g, noisy capturing hardware).4. Usefulness for target task (label is very common in the training dataset but not as common in thetesting dataset).
 In this sense, finding a common approach which could perform well in all style transfer domains is extremely hard but significant.
However, anchors must be carefully designed and used in object detection frameworks.
 Topological changes in neural networks successfully scaled up neural networks to hundreds or even thousands of layers.

 Moreover, we have extended this idea to generate photo-realistic videos (i.g, sequence of images) with a novel loss that uses the optical flow algorithm for pixel coherency between consecutive images.
 The spectrogram can then be converted into the estimated time-domain waveform using the Griffin & Lim algorithm (Griffin & Lim, 1984).
 We base our method on the principle that prototypes should constitute a minimal subset of samples with high interpretable value that can serve as a distillation or condensed view of a dataset (Bien & Tibshirani, 2012).
 Fusion, in the MFSR context, is the problem of mapping multiple low-res representations into a single representation.
In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep RL method for device placement where the learned policy is generalizable to new graphs.
 Since only for k = Ω(n) WL algorithm is guaranteed to distinguish all graphs (for which the running time becomes exponential; see also Fürer (2017)), in the general case WL algorithm can be used only as a strong baseline for graph isomorphism.
 Only when we clearly understand these magical practices can we promote the theoretical understanding of modern neural networks.

e one-hot vectors), the soft labels generated by the pre-trained teacher network provide extra information, which is called the "Dark Knowledge".
 Inducing points summarize the entire posterior distribution, and their number M balances the computational cost and the quality of the approximation.
 Constrained from the semi-Riemannian manifold (Benn & Tucker, 1987; Abraham et al., 1983) where positive semi-definite matrices, including gram matrices, exist, and Centralised Kernel Alignment (Cortes et al., 2012), we are able to define an objective to search for the optimal shrinkage parameter, also called mixing parameter, that is used to mix the estimated gram matrix and a predefined target matrix with the maximum similarity with the oracle matrix on the semi-Riemannian manifold.
 Multi-view constraints are formulated in terms of sparse features, which traditional convolutional neural nets are not designed to handle.
 For example, an exponential distribution can also have zero mean and unit variance.
 By plugging a stochastic variance reduced estimator (Johnson & Zhang, 2013) and the Hessian tracking technique (Gower et al., 2018) into the gradient and Hessian estimation, the approach in (Zhou et al., 2018a) improves both the stochastic first- and second-order oracle complexities to Õ(n0.8/ 1.5).
 For example, a high risk of infection in early timestep will alarm high risk of mortality at later timesteps.
 Tuning such sensitive hyper-parameters is costly in training large-scale models, e.g, BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or XLNet (Yang et al., 2019).
As stated above, the original theoretical foundation of the vanilla BatchNorm is not so solid and the exact reason for its effectiveness is poorly understood, hence BatchNorm maybe not optimal in theory and we might not make better use of it.
 One can estimate the desired conditional entropy by simply substituting p(a|z) to the approximated conditional distributionqφ(a|z).
 Then, our problem is: canwe efficiently learn the policy of a target agent given only the collection of source policies? Note that information about source environmental dynamics, such as the exact state transition distribu-tions and the history of environmental states, will not be visible to the target agent as mentioned above.
 Every sample of this 2D data can be regarded a high dimensional vector, so metrics on the corresponding vector space are applicable to evaluate similarities.

 Using this formulation, we are able to exploit the structures of the spectral matrices corresponding to these differential operators that renders the entire layer O(n log n) for processing a 3 dimensional field of size n.
 It is obvious that using adversarial examples crafted from the private training data to train our models introduces a previously unknown privacy risk, disclosing the participation of the benign examples (Song et al., 2019).
 Before providing a definite answer to the question, we briefly review the findings in percolation theory that motivates our research.
 The function of RNN is capturing the relationship between input process and output process.
 These encoded features are then used by an RNN decoder with a visual attention mechanism to produce final outputs.

 As a byproduct and an exclusive feature, by tracking the weighting factor associated with the probability simplex during training, our method can provide tools for self-adjusted risk assessment and obtain novel insights on the set of domains for the associated tasks.
 Several lines of methods are proposed recently to address this issue.
 While the model is trained on a new task, a reference gradient is computed on a batch of the samples from the episodic memory to guide the current update direction.
 This is possibly because of two difficulties one encounters when dealing with the scaling group: First, unlike SO(2), it is an acyclic and unbounded group; second, an extra index in S incurs a significant increase in model parameters and computational burden.
 The mask module is composed of a hard Sigmoid activation function with a vector of trainable variables as input and the output is regularized with a sparsification loss, resulting in a sparse mask vector with many 0 elements and the rest are real values in (0, 1.
 Moreover, they roughly combine the spatial and temporal features when fitting the prediction model instead of dynamically modelling their interactions.
 In standard deep learning, the experiments in (Shwartz-Ziv & Tishby, 2017) show that during the training process, the neural network first ”remembers” the inputs by increasing the mutual information between the inputs and the representation variables, then compresses the inputs to efficient representation related tothe learning task by discarding redundant information from inputs (decreasing the mutual information between inputs and representation variables).
 For maximal utilization of the network capacity and thus to obtain a more compact model, however, each neuron should be either irreplaceably generic and used by all tasks, or highly specialized for a task such that there exists minimal redundancy among the learned representations.
 Thus, it is quite possible that the objective of k-means converges to a local minimum, which causes the instability of k-means, and is less desirable in practice.
 Existing approaches for conditioning flow-based models can be utilized, but we find that these methods often do not work well on CNF.
To this end, we propose Discrete InfoMax COdes (DIMCO), a deep neural network model that outputs a discrete representation of each datapoint.
 For example, the model size of a 2-bit quantized model is reduced by 16×.
 The Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence is implicitly used in Vanillar GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014), and the 1-Wasserstein distance is employed in WGANs (Arjovsky et al., 2017).
1 Each should contain words that altogether are short, coherent, and alone sufficient for the prediction as a substitute of the input (Lei et al., 2016).
 The dependencies between them are long distance.
 This is in general a challenging task to find the best solution because it may be not a concave-convex min-max optimization.
 This method is distribution-free and flexible to possible extensions.
 The main question is: how can the synapses compute the error derivative based on information available locally? In more recent years, researchers have started to address this challenge by proposing ways in which learning rules that are equivalent to error-backpropagation might be implemented in the brain (Urbanczik & Senn, 2014; Schiess et al., 2016; Roelfsema & Ooyen, 2005; Rombouts et al., 2015; Brosch et al., 2015; Richards & Lillicrap, 2019; Scellier & Bengio, 2019; Amit, 2018; Sacramento et al., 2018), most of which were reviewed in (Marblestone et al., 2016).

 While BicycleGAN requires paired training data, several works (Lee et al., (2018); Huang et al., (2018)) extended it to the unsupervised case, where images in domains A and B are not in correspondence (‘unpaired’).
 Not only is this wasteful, it also leads to “lack of focus”: for complex images with many objects, this may lead to vague captions with substantial repetitions.
Algorithms for forward and inverse problems in partial differential equations via unsupervised learning were recently introduced.
 One important data property that has been used in defense mechanisms is temporal dependency.
 On the other hand, with the Adam optimizer, a smaller starting learning rate is generally used.
 Chen et al., (2018a) proposed a variant of neighbor sampling, which used historical activations to reduce the estimator variance.
 In this paper, we call it Multivariate-MAB problem.
In this paper, we model domain shifts through domain-adaptive filter decomposition (DAFD) with layer branching.
 By alternatively optimizing the generator G and the discriminator D in the GAN, the GAN is able to produce images similar to the original data and effectively complement the training set.
 This requirement is particularly challenging for most classical approaches that are designed to learn localization by strictly mimicking the provided annotations.
 Other methods aim to approximate the filters without computing the graph Laplacian for faster speed (Defferrard et al., 2016).
There are some works on multi-source to single-target adaptation.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-lingual data augmentation (XLDA) as a simple technique that improves generalization across multiple languages and tasks.
We develop a provable and unified black-box min-max stochastic optimization method by integrating a query-efficient randomized zeroth-order (ZO) gradient estimator with a computation-efficient alternating gradient descent-ascent framework, where the former requires a small number of function queries to build a gradient estimate, and the latter needs just one-step descent/ascent update.
 We then train subsequent tasks utilizing the unused capacity of the model.
A single Transformer block consists of two key components: a multi-head self attention layer followed by a feed forward layer (Vaswani et al., 2017).
 Lee & Kim (2019) partially address the pitch range problem by centering the learned embeddings using speaker-wise means.
 This procedure potentially allows the model to recover from its own errors, and Bengio et al., (2015) observe better empirical performance in natural language parsing, image captioning, and speech recognition compared to teacher-forced training.
 We also have to avoid changing words without any gender attributes, such as is and a in the example above.
 More formally, while the distribution of the stochastic gradients in Imagenet is well approximated by a Gaussian, the distribution for BERT seems to be heavy-tailed.
 Additionally, excellent datasets such as QM9 (Ramakrishnan et al., 2014) and ZINC (Irwin et al., 2012) which contain molecules of interest along with their precomputed properties have allowed for comparing different methods and developing state-of-the-art tools.
 The student network is trained to reproduce the behaviors of the teacher network.
 Although Bayesian optimization has seen great success in hyperparameter optimization (Golovin et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016) for deep models, a host of difficulties arise when using Bayesian optimization for neural architecture search.
 More concretely, we use the widthmultiplier1 (Howard et al., (2017)) as a tool to compare the performance of different weight precision values under the same model size.
 Clearly, just learning a representation, even if it is low-dimensional, is not enough.
 Consequently, they cannot provide low-dimensional representations of the data and training is computationally expensive.
 (2) Generated novel behaviours for player customization of action skills in video games.
 Many studies (Zeiler & Fergus, 2013; Yu & Koltun, 2016) have shown that the lower part of the convolution neural network mainly extracts primary features, such as the edges and corners, while the higher part can extract more abstract semantic information.
 As we will demonstrate with results from our algorithm, joint methods yield compatible embeddings which are closer to isomorphic, less sensitive to hubness, and perform better on cross-lingual benchmarks.
 However, because these are closely related to the above three defined perspectives, we consider them as a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive division.
 This effect can be worsened when these components are just one of the many different parts of a data product.
 However, weight sharing has no theoretical guarantee and its impact has not been well studied before.
 In this paper, we take steps toward accomplishing that goal by proposing a technique that allows for mimicking large batches without the computational costs of actually using large batches.
In this study, we tackle the question why ConvNet is essential as an image prior, and try to translate the “deep image prior” with words.
 We find that these approaches are currently showing very promising performances, nonetheless the dependency aspect among nodes, which often exhibit stronglyin many kinds of real-world networks, has not been exploited effectively due to lack of advanced computations within the propagating phase.
Yet, without the aid of over-parameterization, directly training a compressive model architecture may meet the obstacle of being trapped in local optima in contemporary experience.
As the field of representation learning moves closer towards artificial intelligence, it becomes important to efficiently and simultaneously learn both the structures and parameters of a network from arbitrary classes on mobile devices or even Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
 Transitions for which Vex is close to zero are those for which the correlation between the value function V and the observed returns is also close to zero.
 These words can be function words such as prepositions, conjunctions and articles.
 For instance, in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), clinicians argue that these treatment goals should depend on the static patient information (the context) (Berngard et al., 2016).
 For evaluating performances on task i, the set of all possible labels is then Y = Yi.
 The positron will quickly combine with the electrons in the material in a very short time, causing a positron annihilation phenomenon, producing a pair of gamma photon pairs with opposite directions and energy of 511KeV.
 The state-of-the-art VAE-based models such as (Jin et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018) have good generation performance but their decoding scheme is highly complicated and requires careful training.
 This indicates that, con-versely, reducing channels by pruning may limit capability for quantization.
 We consider these quantities random variables at initialization, and, therefore, devote our analysis to deriving expressions for the mean and variance of both ‖yl‖2 and ‖Jk‖2, over the random initializations of the weights.
In this paper we propose a simple and effective stochastic neural network (SE-SNN) that models activation uncertainty through predicting a Gaussian mean and variance at each layer, which is then sampled during the forward pass.

 Second, it is hard to know the underlying model without expert domain knowledge.
 Finally, in `∞-norm attacks, the adversary is only constrained by the amount of noise added to each coordinate of the input vector.
 Dimensionality reduction approaches, such as UMAP (McInnes et al., 2018) or t-SNE (van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008), allow to specify a similarity metric for projection and thereby define the data separation in the inferred latent representation.
 This approach is called online distillation.
 Interestingly, by applying Taylor expansion on CCKL, we show that it can be disentangled into a lower order non-robust component, which is related to causing adversarial behavior, and a higher order robust component.
 Specifically, in addition to the Covariate Shift assumption (p(x) 6= q(x), p(y|x) = q(y|x)), we further assume p(x|y) 6= q(x|y) and p(y) 6= q(y).
 It is worth noticing that overtaking the need of such “feature-engineering” is one of the reasons behind the massive adoption of deep learning techniques.
 This partially inspired a line of follow-up works on eliciting property of the distributions, which we will discuss later.
 In order to guarantee privacy, it is necessary to introduce randomness to the algorithm.
 Bayesian neural networks place a probability distribution over the network parameters, which is translated to an uncertainty in the prediction, providing a technically sound approach but with overhead at inference time.
 Those issues are exacerbated by the fact that training DRL agents is very time consuming, resulting in a high barrier for reevaluation of previous work.
 As explained by Spirtes (2009), in an observational treatment-effect dataset, only the factual outcome is present (i.g, the outcome for the treatment that was actually given) - the counterfactual outcomes are not observed.
 To perform a fair evaluation, evaluators have to manually normalize the underlying stack and delineate the codes to characterize performance or accuracy.
 This collection is unlabeled and actually contains data of many more classes than the end task.
 (II) Besides, the large variance of gradient estimator is the other bottleneck of applying SMD to policy optimization for improving sample efficiency.
Contributions
 Conventional training assumes that all user embeddings are part of the same model.
 This issue can cause the learned policy to underperform in any given target domain.
 On the other hand, the outer minimization problem is to find model parameters that minimizes the loss ` on the adversarial examples {xi}ni=1 that are generated from the inner maximization.
 As a result, the informative level of the low-resolution image is actually ‘richer’ than the image size.
 We observe that for the adversarial images, the classifier starts focusing more on irrelevant aspects of the left side of the image.
 This is also an important method to improve the detection accuracy of keypoints of fixed quantity.
 Thus, finding new and simple hyper-parameter tuning routines that boost the performance of state of the art algorithms is of ultimate importance and one of the most pressing problems in machine learning.
 Conventional transforms that we applied on CNN models are DiscreteWalsh-Hadamard Transform (DWHT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), which have widely been used in image processing but rarely been applied in CNNs (Ghosh & Chellappa, 2016).
 We instead propose to use AL to build data subsets of a large labeled training dataset that give moreaccurate DNNs in less training time.
 For example, one would expect the representations for visual data to incorporate underlying image structures along the spatial dimension, while the representations for speech data might need to be exploited along the temporal dimension.
 The recent work of multi-label metric learning (Liu et al., 2018) gave a systematic studies on advanced methods and proposed a new paradigm with better performance, but still suffers following limitations: 1) inferior capacity: the metric learning is based on linear projection, it doesn’t learn flexible representation with non-linearity.
 In contrast, RPGAN generators instead use stochastic routing during the forward pass as their source of stochasticity.
 The original GAN formulation minimizes the Jensen-Shannon divergence between a model distribution and the data distribution, which suffers from unstable training.
 Moreover, the relationship between each two distant time stamps cannot be directly modeled.
 Particularly, these methods train an RL agent not only to imitate demonstrated actions when it encounters the demonstrated states, but also to reach demonstrated states, when it confronts states that are not observed in thedemonstration data 1 (Ho & Ermon, 2016; Reddy et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019).
 Rethinking the extracted multi-scale features of general FPN, the top-down pathway FPN only introduces high-level semantic information to low-level feature, while ignore the role of low-level feature for localization.
 Since a successful 1-bit weight quantization method has been demonstrated in BinaryConnect (Courbariaux et al., 2015), advances in compression-aware training algorithms in the form of binary codes (e.g, binary weight networks (Rastegari et al., 2016) and LQ-Nets (Zhang et al., 2018)) produce 1-3 bits for quantization while accuracy drop is modest or negligible.
 For example, DARTS (Liu et al., 2019) uses this relaxation to optimise architecture parameters using gradient descent in a bi-level optimisation problem, while SNAS (Xie et al., 2019) updates architecture parameters and network weights under one generic loss.
 These probabilities are indeed easier to interpret than logits, as humans can process probabilities intuitively (Cosmides & Tooby, 1996).
 To overcome this problem, we propose a novel framework, Direct Input and State Estimation (DISE), also built on recurrent neural networks.
In order to overcome the above shortcomings, deep neural networks (DNNs) (Goodfellow et al., 2016) have been introduced to learn the underlying reward function in contextual bandit problem, thanks to their strong representation power.
 Furthermore, in practice, developers always need to evaluate alternative designs of DL models and optimize the models.
We propose a third approach, by extending Invertible Neural Networks (INNs, Dinh et al.,1Code is available, but held back for the review process due to anonymity.(2016); Kingma & Dhariwal (2018); Ardizzone et al., (2019)) for the task of conditional image generation, by adding conditioning inputs to their core building blocks.
 However, there exist directions in the hidden state space that are activated by natural-looking images.
 However, many of these traditional methods synthesize new objects by borrowing components from existing CAD model libraries.
 Therefore, several unsupervised summarization approaches have been proposed, which do not require reference summaries for the target domain.
 Specifically, the transfer of already attained knowledge to benefit new tasks, known as forward transfer, as well as the potential positive impact of learning new concepts to aid in existing tasks, known as backward transfer, are crucial to any continual learning system.
Locatello et al., (2018) put doubts on most methods of disentanglement including penalizing the total correlation term Kim & Mnih (2018); Chen et al., (2018), and they concluded that ”the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations is fundamentally impossible without inductive biases”.
 Semi-supervised VAE (Kingma et al., 2014) needs to be trained carefully with a two-stage hierarchical strategy, while the training process of GAN is a two-stage adversarial game (Chrysos et al., 2019).
Using this simple idea, we make the following contributions.
 The state of the art in algorithms for continual learning fall into three categories.
 While β-VAE achieves better results and does not suffer from the training stability issue of InfoGAN, it faces a trade-off between the disentanglement and reconstruction due to its information bottleneck.
 However, visual perception is more general and access to more compressed representations can often be limited.
 While most of the conventional seq2seq does not require the high-dimensional settings, meaning that it is not usual to translate multiple languages simultaneously, we need to translate signal waves in high dimensions into other signal waves in high dimensions simultaneously.
 Gradient based algorithms such asprojected gradient descent (e.g, Beck & Teboulle (2009); Nesterov (1983)) or Riemannian gradient descent require a projection onto the space of all metrics, which in general, is an intractable problem.
 Our contributions can be summarised as follows:
 Renet al., (2018) build on top of prototypical networks(PN) (Snell et al., 2017) so better class prototypes can be learned with the help of the unlabeled data.
 As the first step, we focus on building a bilingual language model (LM) of English and a target language.
 The visual realism of the world makes it possible to elicit diverse natural human ways of instructing and/or referring to things, and to study the agents’ robustness to this diversity.
We first introduce the global score, a quantitative measure which reflects the closeness of a given embedding to the PCA embedding (which is optimal by means of preserving the data variance).
 Similarly, Dziugaite & Roy (2017) augment the loss to improve generalization and find that this promotes flat minima.
 The method is based on the observation that each DP-SGD update consumes privacy budget in proportion to the quotient of the batch size and the training-set size.
 In the rational agent approach, agents’ decision are best responses and the analysis focuses on the Nash equilibria of the game.
The data used for pre-training should be purely observational and the policies that are being optimized for should not need to interact with the environment during pre-training.
Deep neural networks are known to be large computational models, whose inner workings are difficult to overview for a human.
Worryingly, the current state-of-the-art learning systems, deep neural networks, are known to be unreasonably confident about inputs unrecognizable to humans (Nguyen et al., 2015), and their predictions can be manipulated with imperceptible changes in input space (Szegedy et al., 2013).
 Significant efforts have been carried out by projects such as the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) (Methé et al., 2012) and the Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHIT) project (Qin et al., 2010) in order to understand how the human microbiome can have an effect on human health.
 To this end, we incorporate the multidimensional uncertainty, including vacuity, dissonance, aleatoric uncertainty, and epistemic uncertainty in selecting test nodes for Bayesian DL in GNNs.
 An advantage of separating the semantic parsing process into a generator network and a critic network is that the critic observes each candidate and the input sentence entirely, taking into account bidirectional representations of both sentences and can globally reason over the entire candidate.
 This framework may potentially then be used to train a model that only depends on the relevant features.
 In theory, distributed SGD with gradient sparsification (e.g, Topk, Randk and any other k-contraction operators) with error compensation has been proved to have the1The ring-based AllReduce collective can achieve the bandwidth optimal performance that is not related to the number of workers, but there exist latency terms that will increase with increased number of workers.
 Second, the policy is only implicit via solving the mentioned optimization problem.
 For example, most materials have a heat capacity proportional to T 3 at low temperatures T and the gravitational field of planets (at distance r) should behave as 1/r as r →∞.
Recent work (Simon-Gabriel et al., 2018) presented both theoretical arguments and an empirical one-to-one relationship between input dimension and adversarial vulnerability, showing that the vulnerability of neural networks grows with the input dimension.
 Many alternative divergence measures have been proposed for VI to alleviate this issue (Minka et al., 2005; Hernández-Lobato et al., 2016; Li & Turner, 2016; Csiszár et al., 2004; Bamler et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018a), which provide better bias and variance trade-offs and lead to better predictive results with more accurate uncertainty estimation.
 Using a similar loss function, Hendrycks et al., (2019) showed that the technique of Outlier Exposure (OE) that draws anomalies from a real and diverse dataset can outperform the GAN framework for OOD detection.
 With constant learning rates, theoretical guarantees show that SGD converges quickly to a neighborhood of the minimizer, but then reaches a noise floor beyond which it stops converging; this noise floor depends on the learning rate and the variance of the gradients (Moulines & Bach, 2011; Needell et al., 2014).
 We, hence, propose to substitute the traditional noise injection methods with high quality data augmentation methods in order to improve consistency training.
 And second, one such minimum value is usually approximately known for interpolating models: for instance, it is close to zero for a model trained with the cross-entropy loss.
 Only recenctly new large-scale datasets (eg. by Zhu et al., (2018); Sumbul et al., (2019)) have been generated for remote sensing problems.
 Another line ofdefense work focuses on randomized smoothing where the prediction is robust within some region around the input with a user-chosen probability (Liu et al., 2017; Cao & Gong, 2017; Lécuyer et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2019; Salman et al., 2019).
 Neural architecture search (NAS) allows researchers to automatically search for models that offer the best performance trade-offs relative to some metric of efficiency.
 In addition, decision tree-based approaches are easy to develop and fast to train.
 Consequently, the way of feature tensor interaction and combination is dramatically diversified, from the conventional addition operator‘ only to the combination of addition‘, multiplication d for attention modelling, and dynamic convolution ~.
 Often, the data will be labeled iteratively in batches, where at each iteration an update is made to a current view of the distribution over labels and the next batch of points is selected from regions where the distribution is least certain.
 Merrill (2019), on the other hand, showed that the general counter languages are an upper bound on the expressive capacity of saturated LSTMs.
Summary of Contributions.
 After learning the concept of an “elephant”, a child can identify the elephant in a photo taken under any lightning condition, location, etc.
 The teacher network is typically a narrow network that computes the function to be learned, while the student network is a vastly over-parameterized wide network.
 To alleviate computational issues, we propose Surrogate Model Based Langevin dynamics, that consists of two steps: (i) Learning (using training data) an approximation of the gradient of the potential of the Gibbs distribution.
 For example, Emmanuel de Bezenac (2018) proposed a warping scheme to predict the sea surface temperature, but only considered the linear advectiondiffusion equation.
Our contributions are as follows.
 It avoids memory bandwidth intensive floating point operations through Hamming distance computation and look up table operations (Norouzi et al., 2014; Jegou et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2017).
 The synthetic noise enables researchers to experiment on controlled noise levels, and drives the development of theory and methodology in this field.
 It is noteworthy to mention that FREEBASE is a complex knowledge base where 61% of the relations are beyond binary (defined on more than two nodes).
 Several certification approaches have been proposed: through linear programming (Wong & Kolter, 2018; Wong et al., 2018) or mixed-integer linear-programming (Xiao et al., 2018); semi-definite relaxation (Raghunathan et al., 2018b;a); randomized smoothing (Li et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2019); or estimates of the local Lipschitz constant (Hein & Andriushchenko, 2017; Weng et al., 2018; Tsuzuku et al., 2018).
 During the training of network, the gradient with respect to the weights provides directional information to update the deep network and learn a better representation for the inputs.
However, despite the usefulness and prevalence of metadata in graph learning, there are instances where it desirable to design a system to avoid the effects of a particular kind of sensitive data.
Recent work has aimed to narrow this gap by taking inspiration from cognitive science.
Motivated by this, we propose and investigate a new task - Contextual Text Style Transfer.
 The first avenue, TeamReg, assumes that an agent must be able to predict the behavior of its teammates in order to coordinate with them.
Contributions:
 Besides resorting to approximate verification method, the recent work Xiao et al., (2019) proposed the principle of co-design between training and verification, and showed that the exact verification method can be accelerated by imposing weight sparsity and activation stability (so-called ReLU stability) on trainable network models.
 In a social network, near neighbors may correspond to classmates, whereas nodes separated by greater scales may be in different cities or countries.
 However, sequence modeling actually cares about precision - the fraction of the top-k′ tokens in p(yt|y<t,x) are included in the top-k” of q(yt|y<t,x), because imperfect predictions in the top-k′ cause exposure bias at inference time.
 In this work, we find that characterizing activity patterns by feature correlations— computed with an extension of Gram matrices that we introduce—lets us quantify anomalies to allow state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection rates on OOD examples.
 Different from the plain graph generation problem, a conditional graph synthesis task is to learn a distribution of target graphs conditioning on the input graph, which aims to capture the underlying implicit properties of the graphs, such as their scale-free characteristic.
 Populating the tree with the action samples drawn from a pre-trained policy enables us to perform a computationally feasible search.
 By seamlessly plugging a context-aware module into the existing CNN-based object detection paradigm, conCNN automatically learns and effectively enforces the semantics context constraints, yet requiring minimal modification of the existing deep object detection architecture.
 Our major contributions are as follows:
Many of the proposed joint models for entity and relation extraction rely heavily on external natural language processing (NLP) tools such as dependency parsers.
We leverage these advances for the NAS problem.
 Various methods have been proposed to understand the mechanism of decision making by CNNs.
To facilitate robust training of deep generative models with noisy data, we propose curriculum learning with clustering.
Visualization is an active research area, with various standard techniques such as saliency maps Simonyan et al., (2014) among others Zeiler & Fergus (2014); Mahendran & Vedaldi (2015); Springenberg et al., (2015); Zhou et al., (2016) being used to visualize representations by inverting them.
 GLMs are naturally interpretable in that complicated interactions of non-linear activations are not involved.
 Pruning is the process of removing redundant filters from the network (Anwar et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017; Zylberberg, 2017; Zhu & Gupta, 2017; Raghu et al., 2017; Morcos et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2019).
 Their attack success rates rely on the transferability of adversarial examples and are often lower than that of white-box attacks.
Intuitively, there are two alternative solutions: 1) Truncating inputs by the maximum sequence length to fit the BERTs constraint.
 The deterioration in C-JPG makes the SR processing a huge challenge.
In this paper we introduce a novel type of generative model based on what we call denoising density estimators (DDEs), which supports efficient sampling and density estimation.
 For instance, model accuracy drops by 25% on reactions with 10 or fewer representative instances in thetraining set.
 First, each subroutine still requires the network to learn a function in such a way that it can strongly generalize outside of its training distribution.
The Bayesian RL problem can be viewed as solving a large continuous belief MDP, which is computationally infeasible to solve directly (Ghavamzadeh et al., 2015).
 Thus, this problem is usually ignored, as other aspects are prioritized.
 (2) ML followed by OR paradigm which applies ML at first to provide some additional information, to guide the following OR procedure towards promising regions.
 For example, if the policy learns to select actions which are not contained in the batch, it cannot learn a reasonable value function for those actions.
Our proposed method, the Stochastic Prototype Embedding (SPE), is an extension of the Prototypical Network (PN) (Snell et al., 2017).
 Given an unknown environment, a straightforward way is to set a high reward when robot reaches the final goal state while at all other intermediate states, the reward is either zero or with a small negative value (Zhu et al., 2017).
 For example, reading comprehension tasks are often used to analyze the quality of LMs, contain relatively few words on average, and do not have sufficiently long dependencies (Wang et al., 2019).
Emerging non-volatile (NVM) memories such as resistive random access memory (RRAM) have shown great promise for energy and area-efficient inference (Yu, 2018).
 A contour is represented by an embedding function, typically a signed distance function, and its evolution amounts to solving a differential equation (Osher & Sethian, 1988).
 However, the subtle differences in the meaning of a token in varying contexts are lost when each word is associated with a single representation.
 First, we examine if the NormLIME explanations agree with human intuition.
 It is unclear if GNN embeddings (via simple message-passing) contain all the information needed to reason about complex logical questions on top of the graph structures derived from the formulas, or whether the complex embedding schemes can be learned from backpropagation.
 This has been shown to improve performance on corrupted (Jiang et al., (2017)) and small datasets (Fan et al., (2018)).
Flow based generative models (Dinh et al., 2016; Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018) perform exact density estimation with fast inference and sampling, due to their parallelizability.
 Because the estimation error of the model accumulates as the trajectory grows, it is hard to train a policy on a long synthesized trajectory.
 Thus, the information can flow across positions without any intermediate loss.
 In this regard, sport possesses relational structure similar to that of faces and bodies, which can be represented as a graph of key-points.
 Many of the most promising use cases for compressed models occur in sensitive domains, such as improving access to health care by using machine learning driven diagnostics on mobile phones (Esteva et al., 2017).
 More recent work seeks to learn the temporal abstraction with deep learning (Florensa et al., 2017; Tessler et al., 2017; Haarnoja et al., 2018a).
 Our approach can be interpreted as instantiating the converse of the NFL theorem: any advances made in quality or speed must be due to the algorithm’s specialization to the distribution/family of instances it encounters.
 Object-oriented MDPs (Diuk et al., 2008) show the benefit of using object-oriented representations for structured exploration although the framework as it is presented requires hand-crafted symbolic representations.
 Views can correspond to different modalities such as sounds, images, videos, sequences of previous frames, etc.
This paper makes the following contributions:
 Inspired by these booming techniques, many studies (Bello et al., 2016) adopt the neural networks and the recent advances in artificial intelligence to solve the classic combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), etc.
 The abstractness of attributes further increases the challenge.
 In Figure 1, we report the performance on text classification, Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT) of two models: one trained with neural attention and the other trained with attention weights fixed to a uniform distribution.
 First, it costs natural accuracy.
Nonetheless, all above methods rely on the assumption that the majority answer is more likely to be correct - this is also true for the more sophisticated inference models, as the inferences will mostly likely initiate based on majority-voted answers (when the algorithm has no prior information).
 Because of the broad applicability of zeroth order optimization algorithms, recently there has been a spate of research in improving them from different respects.
 Besides, other existing methods explore network ablation (Zhou et al., (2018)), the winner-take-all strategy (Zhang et al., (2018)), inversion (Mahendran & Vedaldi (2015)), and perturbation (Fong & Vedaldi (2017)) for visual explanation.
 Based on this idea, Liu et al., (2017) first applied the LSTM with attention mechanism in retrosynthesis prediction and achieved comparable performance compared with previous traditional methods.
 For each subject, we know how many times each of d “words” appears, where the dictionary of words is pre-specified.
 Finally, and most relevant to our proposed method, we want our landmarks to focus on the foreground objects.
 However, Bayesian inference in dropout-based models has been shown to be ill-posed, since the induced posterior distributions in such models do not concentrate asymptotically (Osband (2016); Hron et al., (2017)), which jeopardizes both the coverage and discrimination performance of the resulting credible intervals.
 This process involves two key components, message functions F and inference process P .
 This problem is ubiquitous in a wide range of NLP tasks, i.g,, some of the negative examples are highly similar to positive examples.
 Bruck et al., (2006) has made use of the query frequency and varied the number of hash functions based on the query frequency to reduce the overall FPR.
 This leads to diminished utility, especially, for scenarios where we require tight privacy (large noise).
 This issue is exacerbated by the single global pooling step performed at the end of most GNNs that ignores any hierarchical structure within the graph.
 In this paper, we propose that the critical locating areas are more significant in the translation.
 We assume a norm on T (this norm is induced by various parameters corresponding to the transformations, such as angle of rotation and size of the translation).
 This inefficient search continues until non-zero gradients are found, which can then be followed to a local optimum.
 As seen in Table 1 (see also Figure 1), this is true for both state-of-the-art LSTMs and Transformers trained on a variety of datasets.
In this work, we explore deeper into the underlying mechanism for defining effective elements instead of relying on self-learned attention.
 First, they are deficient in pinpointing only the most discriminative, i.g,, salient features that are essential for the fine-grained classification tasks where the between-class shape similarity is very high; for example, pinpointing only the red face of Red-faced Cormorant in the bird classification task in Figure 1 is crucial for explaining why a deep learning model classifies the image as Red-faced Cormorant.
 By identifying the independence between current action and future states in the environment, we are able to take advantage of such independence to reduce the variance of advantage estimation.
 However, a recent study disclosed a critical problem of the “Norm+ReLU-like” builiding block, known as “channel collapse”, where certain channels always produce small output values given any input.
 The observed data is denoted by xt ∈ RD, and can either be a low dimensional projection of zt, such as the current location, or a high dimensional signal that is informative about zt, such as an image.
In this paper, we introduce a new family of loss functions, peer loss functions, to empirical risk minimization (ERM), for a broad class of learning with noisy labels problems.
 For instance, patients who appear to have similar timeseries observations may develop different sets of comorbidities in the future which, in turn, require different treatment guidelines to reduce such risks (Wami et al., 2013).
 The first component, represents the embedding section, which maps words in the vocabulary to continuous dense vector representations of the words.
 In this work, we seek a method to decouple the information bandwidth from layer expressivity.
 Works in this track include Hamilton et al., (2017); Chen et al., (2018a;b); Zou et al., (2019).
 To address this issue, Amsgrad (Reddi et al., 2018) has been proposed to keep an extra “long term memory” variable to preserve the past gradient information and to correct the potential convergence issue in Adam.
 Specifically, stability is guaranteed for τ ≤ 1/Ω( √ L).
Though seemingly similar to detection, in that trackers receive images as input and are expected to output bounding boxes, neural trackers are tasked to solve a subtly different problem from detectors.
 The computation cost is greatly reduced.
 By applying various ad hoc constraints, these methods improve explainability and maintains faithfulness2.
 Memory is a first-class citizen, rather than a separate data store accessed via a special controller.
Recently, with the development of Deep Learning (DL), many researchers attempt to combine the advantages of DL and SC for image SR.
Recently, Ilyas et al., (2019) provide a perspective that adversarial vulnerability is caused by nonrobust features.
 Thus choosing appropriate λ is a critical procedure of learning a model.
 Researchers trying a new idea often have to spend significant effort computing derivatives and integrating them into these large and specialized codebases.
 Given a standard autoencoder and a target data distribution, instead of matching the target distribution in the data space, we map both the generated and target distributions to the latent space using the encoder, and train the generator (or decoder) to minimize the divergence between the mapped distributions.
 Distinctive from most algorithms aforementioned, our approach is motivated by recent neural architecture search (NAS) that aims to find better performance neural architecture with less calculations or less size automatically.
 The attackers often generate noise patterns by exploring the specific network architecture or classification behavior of the target deep neural network so that the small noise at the input layer can accumulate along the network inference layers, finally exceed the decision threshold at the output layer, and result in false decision.
 Interestingly, we also find other stateof-the-art GNN models such as GraphSAGE Hamilton et al., (2017) or DGI Veličković et al., (2019) failed to perform in our high-frequency labels experiments.
 Our formulation can be interpreted as a form of meta-gating since temporal compositionality is now being meta-controlled at various levels of abstractions.
Here, we focus on Signal Temporal Logic (STL) (Donzé & Maler, 2010) as the specification language and exploit its quantitative semantics to integrate a verification procedure into training to provide guarantees with regard to temporal specifications.
 Although visual quality is captured by both metrics, IS is agnostic to intra-conditioning diversity and FID only captures it indirectly.
 For example, Huang et al., (2017a) proposes a multi-branch structure where early prediction can be made based on the current confidence and resource constraints.
 Generalization would (as a first step) require a PBL architecture capable of adapting to variations in the correctness of physics or the quality of training data.
 To reduce information loss, we model high-resolution spectrograms which have the same dimensionality as their corresponding time-domain signals.
 This paradigm is inspired by a high-level error-processing system in humans that generates error-related potential/negativity (ErrP or ERN) (Scheffers et al., 1996).
 The first two metrics make use of the GNN representations learnt using both node features and the graph; while they might be reasonable with a good (well-trained) GNN model, the metrics are not informative when the label budget is limited and/or the network weights are under-trained so that the learned representation is not good.
 We examine the subset of models from our hypothesis class that have the best trade-offs between sub-population risks, and select from this set the one with the smallest risk disparity gap.
 Here, we show that the latter convention leads to suboptimal compression performance and propose a synthetic data generation strategy for both tabular and image data that improves upon standard augmentation schemes.
The problem to address in mixture models such as the GMM is the determination of the number of components M .
 Figure 1 shows potential spatial unsmoothness due to different points of interest.
 Although some works have been proposed to solve such problem (Zhang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019), they lack the inductive capability to do inferences for unseen samples and fall short of fully exploiting shared causal information among the heterogeneous data which often exist in practice.
Encoder-decoder architectures such as VAE-GAN (Larsen et al., 2015) and BiGAN (Donahue et al., 2016) improve sample and reconstruction sharpness through their use of adversarial losses.
 Another approach to incorporate the compositionality is to spatially decompose an image into a collection of objects, each object slot occupying some pixels of the image defined by a segmentation mask (van Steenkiste et al., 2018; Greff et al., 2019).
 These methods typically use a density-based approach (3; 4; 23).
In this paper, we propose a suite of metrics that attempt to alleviate these drawbacks and can be applied across multiple data modalities.
 The most spotlighted recent research for endowing interpretability to VQA model is making the model to produce an answer and its explanation at the same time (Park et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Hudson & Manning, 2019).
 For example, using the state-of-the-art adversarial robust training method (Madry et al., 2017), the defense success rate of the learned model on the testing data is below 60% while that on the training data is almost 100%, which indicates that the robustness fails to generalize.
 As training proceeds, minimizing the loss constrains the network parameters to continually evolve towards the optimal state by successive constriction of the predictions into tighter spaces around the goal.
 The first question is strategic: what systematic form of domain knowledge can we leverage to quickly and cleanly extract style information from raw behavioral data? The second question is formulaic: how can we formalize the learning objective to encourage learning style-calibratable policies? The third question is algorithmic: how do we design practical learning approaches that reliably optimize the learning objective?To address these challenges, we present a novel framework inspired by data programming (Ratner et al., 2016), a paradigm in weak supervision that utilizes automated labeling procedures, called labeling functions, to learn without ground-truth labels.
 In simple pairwise loss such as binomial deviance loss, contrastive loss, and margin loss, pairs are regarded as independent of each other.
 First, some prior works focus on learning from fully-observed data while performing imputation on partially-observed data during test phase (Suzuki et al., 2016; Ivanov et al., 2019).
 Amounts of data typically need to be transferred to and from the RAM and back during the forward pass through each layer, since the local memory is too small to store all the feature maps.
Various approaches have been proposed to augment ConvLSTM, either by modifying networks to explicitly modeling motion (Finn et al., 2016), or by integrating spatio-temporal interaction in ConvLSTM cells (Wang et al., 2017; 2018a).
 While enforcing coarse-grain sparsity Lym et al., (2019) provides significant speedups, the final network contains an insufficient degree of sparsity for deployment on edge devices.
Though it is natural for lattice convolution to exploit the inductive bias, namely translationequivariance, employed by all CNNs, it is not straightforward to generalize to irregularly sampled data, such as point clouds, molecular structures, and social networks.
However, none of these methods explicitly model the feature distributions of the source and target data to measure the discrepancy.
 There is a permutation ambiguity in the indexing of units in a given hidden layer of a neural network, and as a result, this ambiguity extends to the network weights themselves.
In this paper, we prove a theoretical bound for generalization of invariant deep neural networks.
 We argue that for settings where the selected features will be used in downstream prediction tasks, the optimal approach is to select a set of features that can accurately reconstruct all the remaining features.
 Furthermore, we investigate the change of the relative distances between words which is the inner mechanism that leads to these two nice properties in the word embedding.
 Bauer & Mnih (2019) constructed a rich prior by multiplying a simple prior with a learned acceptance function.
While the stability analysis of neural networks has received significant attention e.g, due to adversarial examples (Szegedy et al., 2013), the focus here is only on bounding Lipschitz constants of the forward mapping.
 Although appearing to be a natural choice, one of our key observations is that Gaussian distributions is in fact a rather sub-optimal choice in high dimensional spaces, even for `2 attack.
Our work shows that even though the preliminary neural network is trained with corrupted labels, it still yields intermediate representations that are useful for k-nearest neighbor filtering.
What we mean is this – though it is desirable that the neural network maintain high predictive accuracy while simultaneously remaining fair with regards to a sensitive variable such as race or gender, these two objectives often compete.
 World graph nodes are states that are most frequently selected by the binary latent variables, while edges are inferred from empirical transition statistics between neighboring waypoints.
 The most widely used one for neural networks is the mean-field approximation, where the posterior is represented using an independent Gaussian distribution over all the weights.
Regardless of neighborhood aggregation schemes, most methods, however, suffer from a common problem where neighborhood information is considered to a limited degree (Klicpera et al., 2019).
 Lundberg & Lee (2017) propose SHapley Additive exPlanation(SHAP), which combines the Shapley value from the game theory with the additive feature attribution methods.
 Some recent works start to explore much deeper nature.
But how are these properties of sufficiency and invariance achieved through the training process? Sufficiency alone is trivial — any invertible function of the data is, in theory, sufficient — but it comes at the expense of complexity1 (or minimality) and invariance of the representation.
 Systematic management of these sets ensures that only consistent choices of maximizing actions are used to update Q-values.
 We therefore focus on unsupervised representation learning of high-dimensional tabular data.
 Moreover, the results achieved by different authors are rarely comparable: although most use the MIMIC-III data set, the disparities in labelling rules result in highly variable data sets (eg.
 The update is often based on gradient estimation or some other heuristics.
 When the clean validation data is not available, MentorNet has to use a predefined curriculum (Bengio et al., 2009).
 Based on a 5x5 window, a filter assigns pixels to the majority class if it had been assigned a different class.
 Some decisions may be critical to the agent, such as those for long-term planning or immediate reward gathering; some other decisions may not have much effect on the environment nor the rewards, and thus attacking those steps would not affects the agent’s performance.
 Thus, to improve the sampling performance, the kernel function also needs to be jointly optimized with the generator.
 For example, one can imagine the (middle) red tile at the intersection in Figure 1 being a useful decision state – even across all possible navigation goals the agent could have.
 The resulting classifier is called a “confident-classifier”.
In this paper we are concerned with the problem of learning adaptive policies that can be transferred to environments with varying dynamics, by imitating a small number of expert demonstrations collected from a single source domain.
 Alternatively, the full return can be composed of value functions with increasing discount, an approach called TD(∆) (Romoff et al., 2019).
 Equivalently, this problem can be viewed from the perspective of continual learning, in that we apply the meta-learning approach to the standard online learning problem statement wherein an agent must sequentially make predictions and learn with a potentially varying latent data generating process.
In this work, we introduce a new framework of Bayesian uncertainty modeling for intrinsic rewardbased exploration in RL.
Another line of work has attempted to increase model robustness performance, either by projecting out superficial statistics (Wang et al., 2019), via architectural improvements (Cubuk et al., 2017), pretraining schemes (Hendrycks et al., 2019), or with the use of data augmentations.
 Specifically, the outputs of the policy network are often way outside the bounds of the action space, so that they need to be squashed to fit within the action space.
To this effect, we design several experiments that isolate the impact of the data and label distributions on the quality of the resulting winning tickets.
 A common assumption in autoencoder is that the variables in lowdimensional space are usually sampled from a prior distribution P(z;θ) such as uniform or Gaussian.
 Recent work has provided building blocks for deep complex-valued neural networks (Trabelsi et al., 2017).
 As with networks used in other tasks, GANs have millions of parameters and nontrivial computational requirements.
 Compared with LXMERT (Tan & Bansal, 2019) and ViLBERT (Lu et al., 2019) that use two streams (one Transformer for each modality), our UNITER model can learn joint contextualized representations for image regions and textual words through a single Transformer.
 One of the most widely used methods for solving this problem is the hard thresholding based gradient descent method.
 Thus, another natural question to ask is, how can we enable our agents to have better visual representations? While there are ways to hardcode reward functions to enable agents perform well, can we come up with a generic objective that our agents can optimize that will directly lead them to have good representations? One idea towards this is to use recent work in curiosity.
Contribution.
FL applications generally face non-i.i.d and unbalanced data available to devices, which makes it challenging to ensure good performance across different devices with a FL-trained global model.
 In this study, we further develop this line of research on binary classification problems.
There are some attempts on a global analysis of GANs.
We examine implications of the relation between iterated dominance and RL through applications in mechanism design, a field in economics that studies how to set incentives for rational agents, so as to achieve desired objectives.
 They use a discriminator to detect the discrepancy between real samples and generated samples, and feed the signal back to upgrade the generator (a LM).
Although zero-shot learning in image classification has received increasing attention (Larochelle et al., 2008), PZSL is not explored.
Our contributions are as follows:
 It was shown that the model can recover compounds contained in the QM9 database of small molecules (Ruddigkeit et al., 2012; Ramakrishnan et al., 2014) when trained on a subset, but different configurations of the same molecule were not analyzed.
 The main approach is to start with one conformation and make small changes to it over time, e.g, by using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or molecular dynamics (MD).
 More precisely we consider this adaptation-imputation setting for nonstochastic missing data, i.g,when the same features are missing for all target samples.
 In fact, the success of this paradigm is usually restricted to certain domains like handwritten characters (Lake et al., 2013), or requires additional supervision (Dixit et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018b) or sophisticated heuristics (Hariharan & Girshick, 2017).
 (2) The behaviors of likelihood-based generative models can be counter-intuitive and brittle.
To this end, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) schemes have been studied in the literature (Bello et al., 2016; Khalil et al., 2017; Deudon et al., 2018; Kool et al., 2019) as a Markov decision process (MDP) can be naturally designed with rewards derived from the optimization objective of the target problem.
 A few-shot learning algorithm can learn to identify features that are important for doing well on the base set – these can be adapted to classify the few labeled examples as long as the domain remains similar.
Contributions.
We argue that this can be accomplished by performing goal-directed exploration.
Following the direction suggested in (Alemi et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017) we describe the VAE from an information theoretic perspective.
 Without data augmentation, the estimated predictor (dashed blue) is a line that captures the global structure and obtains low error.
 However, evolution has the disadvantage of relying on heuristics or random sampling when choosing mutations.
However, the models trained by these methods are dedicated to specific devices, and thus do not possess the ability to be reconfigured for use on different devices.
 However, most existing methods focus only on finding the correspondences, not on learning the structure of the manifolds itself.
From an applications perspective, being able to adapt to changing class semantics is a desirable feature.
Recent work (Tomczak & Welling, 2018; Wang et al., 2017; Gu et al., 2018) has therefore focused on more complex Gaussian mixture based priors.
 Motivated by the limitations of standard representations, we propose using the robust optimization framework as a tool to enforce (user-specified) priors on features that models should learn (and thus on their learned feature representations).
 In gradient-based approaches, search is typically performed without sampling procedure (Liu et al., (2018b); Xie et al., (2018)) or hand-crafted sampling (Liu et al., (2018a)).
 If the agent imitates the trajectories around the orange path, it would receive the nearby positive rewards quickly but it is unlikely to collect the gold within a given time limit.
Inspired by a prior work Solomon et al., (2014) that generalised label propagation to graph-based soft SSL setting and motivated by the fact that GNNs have inspired state-of-the-art models for traditional graph-based SSL, we make the following contributions.
 A remarkable extreme example are adversarial attacks (Szegedy et al., 2013), in which small changes, imperceptible to the human brain, can alter the classification output of the network.
 Given a number of tasks with similar structures, meta-RL methods enable agents learn such structure from previous experience on many tasks.
In this paper, we demonstrate that partial models will often fail to make correct predictions under a new policy, and link this failure to a problem in causal reasoning.
 The authors of GEM mentioned that better memory update strategies could be employed to obtain a representative set of examples for past tasks, such as building a coreset per task (Lucic et al., 2018).
 Since deep learning uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD), it is trivial to do such data augmentation on the fly.
 Take DOOM as an example, the environment gives back a reward whenever an enemy is killed by the agent (see Figure 1(a)).
 Such accuracy loss may sometimes be inevitable: for example, the task may involve heavy-tailed distributions and adding noise will definitely hinder visibility of examples in the tails (Feldman, 2019; Bagdasaryan & Shmatikov, 2019).
 In the backward pass meProp performs a “Top-K” operation on the output activation gradients which sets components not ranked in the Top-K by magnitude to zero.
 In particular, in the case of element-wise compression of independent identically distributed values, the lower bound of amount of bits per element is given by the entropy (Shannon, 1948):H(q) = \\u2212 L\\u2211i=1p(qi) log2 p(qi) (1)of the quantized values {qi}, where p(qi) denotes the probability of qi.
 In GANs, the generator is trained via minimizing a neural network (discriminator) defined probability divergence (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Arjovsky et al., 2017; Nowozin et al., 2016).
 While these strategies differ on the state distribution at which the expert actions are optimized – for example BC uses the state distribution of the expert, DAgger-like approachesuse the state distribution from the policy being trained – the supervision signal itself is the expert’s behavior at each step.
 By taking the advantages of both the TW and SLW, the proposed HWR method can preserve their model size compared to ternary weights, as well as avoiding the accuracy degradation in networks.
 For example, hospitals in one region may train a model to detect HIV and share it with hospitals in different regions.
 We achieve this by not only showing that our proposed attention for SNP significantly improves the standard SNP under the under-fitting settings (see fig.  1), but also by making a stronger claim i.g,, in a sequential setting like ours, it is not optimal to perform attention on a memory buffer that simply stores all the observed contexts.
 It is therefore intriguing that consistency regularization has not been clearly beneficial in this context.
With the rapid growth of data, distributed SGD (DSGD) (Dekel et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014b) has attracted much attention since it can parallelly calculate a batch of stochastic gradients.
 We should not consider presenting N with an input that is outside of its world (or maybe we should train it to answer that the \\u201cinput is outside of my world\\u201d in such cases).
 (ii) Decoding via maximum-likelihood principle becomes an NP-hard problem (Berlekamp et al., 1978).
 FLoP significantly outperforms the other provers on harder problems, demonstrating its ability to find longer proofs.
The penalty term is implemented using the semantic loss (SL) (Xu et al., 2018).
 Therefore, there has been a spur of recent work (Donahue et al., 2017; Larsen et al., 2016; Rosca et al., 2019) which aims integrate GANs in a VAE framework to improve VAE generation quality while covering all the modes.
 However, while these approaches improve upon the likelihood score, we argue that OoD detection scores which are fundamentally based on the likelihood values are not robust, as the likelihood estimates produced by commonly used DGMs are not reliable for OoD data, similar to how deep discriminative models produce unreliable output predictions on OoD data.
Thanks to the powerful graph representation learning models which can effectively capture local structural information, we can use a learning algorithm to learn how to count subgraph isomorphisms from a lot of examples.
 In short, the training procedure for generative adversarial networks (GANs) is modified so that the generator network is rewarded for producing data that are both realistic and deceive a fixed target network.
Embedded methods aim to remove this burden by learning the model while simultaneously selecting the subset of relevant features.
As a step towards the aforementioned desiderata, we propose a general method to learn sparse representations of discrete objects.
 In each iteration of the neural Q-learning algorithm, it updates the network weight parameters using the temporal difference (TD) error and the gradient of the neural network function.
 (Lakshminarayanan et al., (2017) found adversarial training provides additional benefits in some of their experiments, but we will ignore adversarial training and focus only on ensembles with random initialization in this paper.
 These methods can solve tasks with higher sample efficiency than model-free DRL algorithms.
 This allows for additional stability in optimization by circumventing dueling training objectives but leads to suboptimal policies.
 In the data-free setting, the perturbation is created only with the trained neural network.
 The optimization for the number of local iterations per round or learning rates has been handled in several literatures (e.g, Huang et al., (2018); Li et al., (2019c); Wang et al., (2019)); by extension we discuss, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the effects of optimizers, network depth/width, and regularization techniques.
 This sheds light as to why training and generalization is easier using datasets where the features and labels are semantically linked versus others where there is no meaningful relationship between the features and labels (even when the same network is used for training).
 First, economists have only managed to solve for the Nash equilibrium under very specific auction designs.
 As the main objective is instance detection, exact labels for the whole object or its boundary are not necessary at this stage.
Matching queries to bid phrases: Web search engines allow ads to be served for not just queries bidded on directly by advertisers, referred to as bid phrases, but also for related queries with matching intent.
 This is illustrated in Figure 1, where we show how our model inserts two new words into a sentence by copying two spans of (more than) twenty tokens each.
 To overcome this challenge, one possible solution is to estimate the ratio of densities between two successive window without computing the densities themselves.
 OpenAI Generative Pre-Training (GPT) (Radford et al., 2018) showed that training large Transformer models on BooksCorpus could lead to rich and useful representations that could be fine-tuned on a variety of downstream tasks covering language understanding, commonsense reasoning and question-answering.
 Figure 1 shows a failure case where OOD detection is beneficial.
 Sometimes, it leads to novel discoveries in scientific explorations.
Maximizing the mutual information between the visited states and the goal states, I(S;G), results in a natural exploration of the environment while learning to reach to different goal states (Warde-Farley et al., 2018; Pong et al., 2019).
 This is a version of Problem (2) with R(ht,ht−1) = ‖ht −Ght−1‖1, where G ∈ Rh×h is an affine transformation that promotes the correlation between ht and ht−1.
 Nonetheless, end-to-end learning of free-form parameters is commonly the most accurate approach to complex visual recognition tasks when there is sufficient data.
 To our knowledge, all deep active learning research so far considers training deep models from scratch.
 Although it enables us to gain a more comprehensive assessment of the models, the influence of different datasets on models is simply reflected by a holistic metric, which is not interpretable, and consequently, we are not clear about how different datasets influence the choices of model architectures.
Usually, transportation planning objectives are mobility-based, such as maximizing OD trips.
 Deep learningbased techniques have made remarkable progress in parallel VC.
 We make the following contribution:
 We do not assume that the mechanism by which examples (e.g, images, audio signals) are rendered from multiple classes is known.
To address this difficulty, recent works have taken an approach of learning a generative model that generates images from corresponding attributes, and of then training a classifier to predict classes from the generated synthesis images (Mishra et al., 2017; Verma & Rai, 2017; Xian et al., 2018b; Felix et al., 2018).
 As shown, 8-bit fixed point (8-FX) achieves improved performance and area over 8-FP.
 PCRs utilize deltas to dynamically compress entire datasets at a fidelity suitable for each application’s needs, avoiding duplicating the dataset (potentially many times) at various fidelity levels.
 However, in the data poor regime these methods differ, and an implicit regularization brought forward by the dynamics of the gradient descent algorithm provides a stronger rank regularization.
 But high complexity of these network makes them less suitable for real-time applications and lightweight platforms with limited computational and memory resources.
 In Sections 4 and 5, we discuss the application of our representation in both cases.
Invariance to distribution shifts: We say that a function is invariant to a given input perturbation when the corresponding output does not change with the perturbation.
 They have shown strong performance in various settings thanks to their high flexibility.
 (2) Adjacent simple cells have quadrature phase relationship (Pollen & Ronner, 1981).
 Given a reference image, our goal is to develop a stroke-based rendering approach that can imitate the human drawing or strokes used in generating the image.
Our contribution is threefold:
In this paper, we show that leveraging the sequential structure of the data at-hand can lead to improved performance on sequence-level tasks (i.g,, the target task).
 The aim of the present work is to apply Jalalzai et al., (2018)’s methodology to text data represented by state of the art embeddings.
 In the case of a recurrent neural network, these are the transition, input, and output matrices.
Main contributions Our key contributions are:
 It then shares the gradient update with its peers.
 It was additionally hypothesized that networks were un-trainable when the conjugate kernel was sufficiently close to its limit.
 CNN-based representations fail to accurately relay all relevant features for interacting objects in scenes.
If we assume that the input sequences in the training data lay in a low-dimensional manifold, as is typically believed for real-world data, then we can train an autoencoder with a small number of hidden units, sufficient to encode the entire sequence.
 In this paper, we take a different approach to randomization.
Several graph neural networks perform pooling in a hierarchical manner.
However, the attention in vanilla Transformer has a obvious drawback, as the Transformer assigns credits to all components of the context.
 Firstly, we commonly assume that the realdata which we aim to correctly classify or predict with a deep network lie on one or more manifolds, and thus design a network to perform appropriately on such a manifold.
 This retraining/adaptation scheme might also be impractical considering the significant overhead induced by catering to various image processing tasks and models.
 Here, information can be occluded by moving objects such as fences (Yamashita et al., 2010), raindrops (Qian et al., 2018), persons (Kim et al., 2019), stains on photographic films (Tang et al., 2011).
 To overcome this limitation, Malinin et al., (2019) proposed to model the entire distribution of an ensemble using a Dirichlet distribution parametrized by a neural network, referred to as a prior network (Malinin & Gales, 2018).
 They attribute this to the fact that the negative impact coming with RL is severer than so-called exposure bias caused by MLE.
 Conversely, planning provides optimal control, which starting from a given state (local) generates actions (dynamic) that are temporally coherent and result in a better-executed trajectories (exact).
 Here, we focus on changing a single attribute dimension to achieve adversarial goals while keeping the generated adversarial image reasonably-looking (e.g, see Figure 1).
In this work, we propose a novel hybrid method, called ergodic inference (EI).
In this work, we present a general framework for modeling the joint distribution p(x1, …,xk) over k channels.
 Inspired by studies in Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), we propose a Graph FilterDiscriminant (GFD) Score metric to measure the power of a graph convolutional filter in discriminating node representations of different classes on a specific graph.
 The two primary components of our model are (i) the Basis Function Learner network which encodes the basis functions for the distribution of tasks, and (ii) the Weights Generator network which produces the appropriate weights given a few labelled samples.
 Therefore, considerable research efforts are invested in adopting DNNs for mobile, embedded, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices (Kim et al., 2015).
 An alternative, more tractable problem which we address in this work is to accept the possibility of SIDS, but to carefully manage incentives for SIDS.
 With the development of deep neural networks in recent years, some deep variants have been proposed.
 Next-frame prediction for complex or rapid-changing observations, however, is rather difficult for forward dynamics models, especially when the prediction is made solely based on the current state and the taken action.
 In their approach (Figure 1a), Mithun et al., (2019) proposes a Text-Guided Attention (TGA) mechanism to attend on segment-level features w.r.t. the sentence-level representations.
 This generality, combined with the strong performance of its representations in downstream linear classification tasks, makes CPC a promising candidate for investigating the efficacy of predictable representations for data-efficient image recognition.
 Moreover, several simulations are often necessary to identify stable configurations away from local minima.
 Our experiments show that APE do not suffer much performance loss from an optimal policy, while causing, on average, the cloned policy to experience over 5 times degradation compared to the optimal policy.
 Semantic relationships between words (specifically similarity, relatedness, paraphrase and analogy) are proven to manifest as linear relationships between rows of the PMI matrix (subject to known error terms), of which word embeddings can be considered low-rank projections.
 We consider such property as ’data efficiency’, namely how efficient a learning paradigm utilizes annotated samples to achieve a pre-defined performance measure.
 For example, at the very beginning, one is always not sure about the distance between the headstock and wall or other vehicles, which may lead to some accidents.
 With the abundance of 8-bit integer deep learning ‘ops’ deployed to accelerate inference tasks, much of the research into training methods have also focused on integer based fixed-point numeric formats (Zhou et al., 2016; De Sa et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018).
 If surrogate gradients are available, it is beneficial to preferentially sample parameter perturbations from the subspace defined by these directions (14).
In this work, we show that it is, in fact, possible in many cases to recover the structure and weights of an unknown ReLU network by querying it.
 The main rationale of our approach is that a teacher typically provides substantially more information than just the kind of motion to perform.
 Theoretically (Moreau & Bruna, 2016)and empirically (Gregor & LeCun, 2010; Sprechmann et al., 2013; Zhang & Ghanem, 2018), the resulted algorithms are with improved accuracy and efficiency comparing to their original counterparts (Giryes et al., 2018).
 There models can be viewed as message passage based graph nerual networks (Gilmer et al., 2017) that pass messages over the fully connected graph through the message passing function (Sukhbaatar et al., 2016) or the use of an attention mechanism (Hoshen, 2017; Van Steenkiste et al., 2018).
 To improve the robustness of the random forests, we take one step further by balancing the decision trees, i.g,, maximizing the number of leaf nodes for the same tree depth.
 Our threat model assumes an attacker can introduce a noise-based perturbation to the raw audio input signal.
Our main contributions are:
 Particularly, this is a significant barrier for processing data streams with low-latency.
 Training dynamics are slow near singular regions caused by weight-space symmetry and stochastic gradient descent might travel near these regions throughout training (Saad and Solla, 1995; Wei et al., 2008; Amari et al., 2006; Dauphin et al., 2014; Orhan and Pitkow, 2017).
 As can be seen, the role of the teacher network in these two methods is simply to provide an intermediate representation for imitation while does not give extra help during the training process.
In the context of GAN training, Feizi et al., (2017) show that for WGANs with a linear generator and quadratic discriminator GDA succeeds in learning a Gaussian using polynomially many samples in the dimension.
 Unlike topics, the word embeddings do not capture thematic structures (topical semantics) underlying in the document collection.
 For popular policy optimization algorithms like Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Crtic (A3C) (Mnih et al., 2016), Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) (Schulman et al., 2015), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017), and Soft Actor Critic (SAC) (Haarnoja et al., 2018), conventional regularization methods were not considered.
 On the contrary, classical graph based segmentation models (Boykov et al., 2001; Yedidia et al., 2003) do not require any learning data and can incorporate specific domain knowledge.
 They showed that if the generative model successfully approximates data distribution, this approach can be a strong way to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem.
 To address this problem, we propose to further learn transitional skills (LTS), where discovered primitive skills, same as prior works (Eysenbach et al., (2018)), are distinguishable and as diverse as possible.
 These involve prior knowledge about phone numbers, which may impede computers from learning the fundamentals of programming and math.
This goal of estimating missing flow field data has many similarities with image inpainting, as it is essentially a scene completion process using partial observations.
